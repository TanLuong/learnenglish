1,An Occurence At Owl Creek Bridge - By Amrbose Bierce,"  <b>I</b>  <br><br>  A man stood upon a railroad bridge in northern Alabama, looking down into the swift water twenty feet below. The man's hands were behind his back, the wrists bound with a cord. A rope closely encircled his neck. It was attached to a stout cross-timber above his head and the slack fell to the level of his knees. Some loose boards laid upon the sleepers supporting the metals of the railway supplied a footing for him and his executioners--two private soldiers of the Federal army, directed by a sergeant who in civil life may have been a deputy sheriff. At a short remove upon the same temporary platform was an officer in the uniform of his rank, armed. He was a captain. A sentinel at each end of the bridge stood with his rifle in the position known as ""support,"" that is to say, vertical in front of the left shoulder, the hammer resting on the forearm thrown straight across the chest--a formal and unnatural position, enforcing an erect carriage of the body. It did not appear to be the duty of these two men to know what was occurring at the center of the bridge; they merely blockaded the two ends of the foot planking that traversed it. Beyond one of the sentinels nobody was in sight; the railroad ran straight away into a forest for a hundred yards, then, curving, was lost to view. Doubtless there was an outpost farther along. The other bank of the stream was open ground--a gentle acclivity topped with a stockade of vertical tree trunks, loopholed for rifles, with a single embrasure through which protruded the muzzle of a brass cannon commanding the bridge. Midway of the slope between the bridge and fort were the spectators--a single company of infantry in line, at ""parade rest,"" the butts of the rifles on the ground, the barrels inclining slightly backward against the right shoulder, the hands crossed upon the stock. A lieutenant stood at the right of the line, the point of his sword upon the ground, his left hand resting upon his right. Excepting the group of four at the center of the bridge, not a man moved. The company faced the bridge, staring stonily, motionless. The sentinels, facing the banks of the stream, might have been statues to adorn the bridge. The captain stood with folded arms, silent, observing the work of his subordinates, but making no sign. Death is a dignitary who when he comes announced is to be received with formal manifestations of respect, even by those most familiar with him. In the code of military etiquette silence and fixity are forms of deference.  <br><br>  The man who was engaged in being hanged was apparently about thirty-five years of age. He was a civilian, if one might judge from his habit, which was that of a planter. His features were good--a straight nose, firm mouth, broad forehead, from which his long, dark hair was combed straight back, falling behind his ears to the collar of his well-fitting frock coat. He wore a mustache and pointed beard, but no whiskers; his eyes were large and dark gray, and had a kindly expression which one would hardly have expected in one whose neck was in the hemp. Evidently this was no vulgar assassin. The liberal military code makes provision for hanging many kinds of persons, and gentlemen are not excluded.  <br><br>  The preparations being complete, the two private soldiers stepped aside and each drew away the plank upon which he had been standing. The sergeant turned to the captain, saluted and placed himself immediately behind that officer, who in turn moved apart one pace. These movements left the condemned man and the sergeant standing on the two ends of the same plank, which spanned three of the cross-ties of the bridge. The end upon which the civilian stood almost, but not quite, reached a fourth. This plank had been held in place by the weight of the captain; it was now held by that of the sergeant. At a signal from the former the latter would step aside, the plank would tilt and the condemned man go down between two ties. The arrangement commended itself to his judgment as simple and effective. His face had not been covered nor his eyes bandaged. He looked a moment at his ""unsteadfast footing,"" then let his gaze wander to the swirling water of the stream racing madly beneath his feet. A piece of dancing driftwood caught his attention and his eyes followed it down the current. How slowly it appeared to move, What a sluggish stream!  <br><br>  He closed his eyes in order to fix his last thoughts upon his wife and children. The water, touched to gold by the early sun, the brooding mists under the banks at some distance down the stream, the fort, the soldiers, the piece of drift--all had distracted him. And now he became conscious of a new disturbance. Striking through the thought of his dear ones was a sound which he could neither ignore nor understand, a sharp, distinct, metallic percussion like the stroke of a blacksmith's hammer upon the anvil; it had the same ringing quality. He wondered what it was, and whether immeasurably distant or near by--it seemed both. Its recurrence was regular, but as slow as the tolling of a death knell. He awaited each stroke with impatience and--he knew not why--apprehension. The intervals of silence grew progressively longer, the delays became maddening. With their greater infrequency the sounds increased in strength and sharpness. They hurt his ear like the thrust of a knife; he feared he would shriek. What he heard was the ticking of his watch.  <br><br>  He unclosed his eyes and saw again the water below him. ""If I could free my hands,"" he thought, ""I might throw off the noose and spring into the stream. By diving I could evade the bullets and, swimming vigorously, reach the bank, take to the woods and get away home. My home, thank God, is as yet outside their lines; my wife and little ones are still beyond the invader's farthest advance.""  <br><br>  As these thoughts, which have here to be set down in words, were flashed into the doomed man's brain rather than evolved from it the captain nodded to the sergeant. The sergeant stepped aside.  <br><br>  <b>II</b>  <br><br>  Peyton Farquhar was a well-to-do planter, of an old and highly respected Alabama family. Being a slave owner and like other slave owners a politician he was naturally an original secessionist and ardently devoted to the Southern cause. Circumstances of an imperious nature, which it is unnecessary to relate here, had prevented him from taking service with the gallant army that had fought the disastrous campaigns ending with the fall of Corinth, and he chafed under the inglorious restraint, longing for the release of his energies, the larger life of the soldier, the opportunity for distinction. That opportunity, he felt, would come, as it comes to all in war time. Meanwhile he did what he could. No service was too humble for him to perform in aid of the South, no adventure too perilous for him to undertake if consistent with the character of a civilian who was at heart a soldier, and who in good faith and without too much qualification assented to at least a part of the frankly villainous dictum that all is fair in love and war.  <br><br>  One evening while Farquhar and his wife were sitting on a rustic bench near the entrance to his grounds, a gray-clad soldier rode up to the gate and asked for a drink of water. Mrs. Farquhar was only too happy to serve him with her own white hands. While she was fetching the water her husband approached the dusty horseman and inquired eagerly for news from the front.  <br><br>  ""The Yanks are repairing the railroads,"" said the man, ""and are getting ready for another advance. They have reached the Owl Creek bridge, put it in order and built a stockade on the north bank. The commandant has issued an order, which is posted everywhere, declaring that any civilian caught interfering with the railroad, its bridges, tunnels or trains will be summarily hanged. I saw the order.""  <br><br>  ""How far is it to the Owl Creek bridge?"" Farquhar asked.  <br><br>  ""About thirty miles.""  <br><br>  ""Is there no force on this side the creek?""  <br><br>  ""Only a picket post half a mile out, on the railroad, and a single sentinel at this end of the bridge.""  <br><br>  ""Suppose a man--a civilian and student of hanging--should elude the picket post and perhaps get the better of the sentinel,"" said Farquhar, smiling, ""what could he accomplish?""  <br><br>  The soldier reflected. ""I was there a month ago,"" he replied. ""I observed that the flood of last winter had lodged a great quantity of driftwood against the wooden pier at this end of the bridge. It is now dry and would burn like tow.""  <br><br>  The lady had now brought the water, which the soldier drank. He thanked her ceremoniously, bowed to her husband and rode away. An hour later, after nightfall, he repassed the plantation, going northward in the direction from which he had come. He was a Federal scout.  <br><br>  <b>III</b>  <br><br>  As Peyton Farquhar fell straight downward through the bridge he lost consciousness and was as one already dead. From this state he was awakened--ages later, it seemed to him--by the pain of a sharp pressure upon his throat, followed by a sense of suffocation. Keen, poignant agonies seemed to shoot from his neck downward through every fiber of his body and limbs. These pains appeared to flash along well-defined lines of ramification and to beat with an inconceivably rapid periodicity. They seemed like streams of pulsating fire heating him to an intolerable temperature. As to his head, he was conscious of nothing but a feeling of fulness--of congestion. These sensations were unaccompanied by thought. The intellectual part of his nature was already effaced; he had power only to feel, and feeling was torment. He was conscious of motion. Encompassed in a luminous cloud, of which he was now merely the fiery heart, without material substance, he swung through unthinkable arcs of oscillation, like a vast pendulum. Then all at once, with terrible suddenness, the light about him shot upward with the noise of a loud splash; a frightful roaring was in his ears, and all was cold and dark. The power of thought was restored; he knew that the rope had broken and he had fallen into the stream. There was no additional strangulation; the noose about his neck was already suffocating him and kept the water from his lungs. To die of hanging at the bottom of a river!--the idea seemed to him ludicrous. He opened his eyes in the darkness and saw above him a gleam of light, but how distant, how inaccessible! He was still sinking, for the light became fainter and fainter until it was a mere glimmer. Then it began to grow and brighten, and he knew that he was rising toward the surface--knew it with reluctance, for he was now very comfortable. ""To be hanged and drowned,"" he thought? ""that is not so bad; but I do not wish to be shot. No; I will not be shot; that is not fair.""  <br><br>  He was not conscious of an effort, but a sharp pain in his wrist apprised him that he was trying to free his hands. He gave the struggle his attention, as an idler might observe the feat of a juggler, without interest in the outcome. What splendid effort!--what magnificent, what superhuman strength! Ah, that was a fine endeavor! Bravo! The cord fell away; his arms parted and floated upward, the hands dimly seen on each side in the growing light. He watched them with a new interest as first one and then the other pounced upon the noose at his neck. They tore it away and thrust it fiercely aside, its undulations resembling those of a water snake. ""Put it back, put it back!"" He thought he shouted these words to his hands, for the undoing of the noose had been succeeded by the direst pang that he had yet experienced. His neck ached horribly; his brain was on fire; his heart, which had been fluttering faintly, gave a great leap, trying to force itself out at his mouth. His whole body was racked and wrenched with an insupportable anguish! But his disobedient hands gave no heed to the command. They beat the water vigorously with quick, downward strokes, forcing him to the surface. He felt his head emerge; his eyes were blinded by the sunlight; his chest expanded convulsively, and with a supreme and crowning agony his lungs engulfed a great draught of air, which instantly he expelled in a shriek!  <br><br>  He was now in full possession of his physical senses. They were, indeed, preternaturally keen and alert. Something in the awful disturbance of his organic system had so exalted and refined them that they made record of things never before perceived. He felt the ripples upon his face and heard their separate sounds as they struck. He looked at the forest on the bank of the stream, saw the individual trees, the leaves and the veining of each leaf--saw the very insects upon them: the locusts, the brilliant-bodied flies, the grey spiders stretching their webs from twig to twig. He noted the prismatic colors in all the dewdrops upon a million blades of grass. The humming of the gnats that danced above the eddies of the stream, the beating of the dragon flies' wings, the strokes of the water-spiders' legs, like oars which had lifted their boat--all these made audible music. A fish slid along beneath his eyes and he heard the rush of its body parting the water.  <br><br>  He had come to the surface facing down the stream; in a moment the visible world seemed to wheel slowly round, himself the pivotal point, and he saw the bridge, the fort, the soldiers upon the bridge, the captain, the sergeant, the two privates, his executioners. They were in silhouette against the blue sky. They shouted and gesticulated, pointing at him. The captain had drawn his pistol, but did not fire; the others were unarmed. Their movements were grotesque and horrible, their forms gigantic.  <br><br>  Suddenly he heard a sharp report and something struck the water smartly within a few inches of his head, spattering his face with spray. He heard a second report, and saw one of the sentinels with his rifle at his shoulder, a light cloud of blue smoke rising from the muzzle. The man in the water saw the eye of the man on the bridge gazing into his own through the sights of the rifle. He observed that it was a grey eye and remembered having read that grey eyes were keenest, and that all famous marksmen had them. Nevertheless, this one had missed.  <br><br>  A counter-swirl had caught Farquhar and turned him half round; he was again looking into the forest on the bank opposite the fort. The sound of a clear, high voice in a monotonous singsong now rang out behind him and came across the water with a distinctness that pierced and subdued all other sounds, even the beating of the ripples in his ears. Although no soldier, he had frequented camps enough to know the dread significance of that deliberate, drawling, aspirated chant; the lieutenant on shore was taking a part in the morning's work. How coldly and pitilessly--with what an even, calm intonation, presaging, and enforcing tranquillity in the men--with what accurately measured intervals fell those cruel words:  <br><br>  ""Attention, company! . . Shoulder arms! . . . Ready! . . . Aim! . . . Fire!""  <br><br>  Farquhar dived--dived as deeply as he could. The water roared in his ears like the voice of Niagara, yet he heard the dulled thunder of the volley and, rising again toward the surface, met shining bits of metal, singularly flattened, oscillating slowly downward. Some of them touched him on the face and hands, then fell away, continuing their descent. One lodged between his collar and neck; it was uncomfortably warm and he snatched it out.  <br><br>  As he rose to the surface, gasping for breath, he saw that he had been a long time under water; he was perceptibly farther down stream nearer to safety. The soldiers had almost finished reloading; the metal ramrods flashed all at once in the sunshine as they were drawn from the barrels, turned in the air, and thrust into their sockets. The two sentinels fired again, independently and ineffectually.  <br><br>  The hunted man saw all this over his shoulder; he was now swimming vigorously with the current. His brain was as energetic as his arms and legs; he thought with the rapidity of lightning.  <br><br>  The officer,"" he reasoned, ""will not make that martinet's error a second time. It is as easy to dodge a volley as a single shot. He has probably already given the command to fire at will. God help me, I cannot dodge them all!""  <br><br>  An appalling splash within two yards of him was followed by a loud, rushing sound, diminuendo, which seemed to travel back through the air to the fort and died in an explosion which stirred the very river to its deeps!  <br><br>  A rising sheet of water curved over him, fell down upon him, blinded him, strangled him! The cannon had taken a hand in the game. As he shook his head free from the commotion of the smitten water he heard the deflected shot humming through the air ahead, and in an instant it was cracking and smashing the branches in the forest beyond.  <br><br>  ""They will not do that again,"" he thought; ""the next time they will use a charge of grape. I must keep my eye upon the gun; the smoke will apprise me--the report arrives too late; it lags behind the missile. That is a good gun.""  <br><br>  Suddenly he felt himself whirled round and round--spinning like a top. The water, the banks, the forests, the now distant bridge, fort and men--all were commingled and blurred. Objects were represented by their colors only; circular horizontal streaks of color--that was all he saw. He had been caught in a vortex and was being whirled on with a velocity of advance and gyration that made him giddy and sick. In a few moments he was flung upon the gravel at the foot of the left bank of the stream--the southern bank--and behind a projecting point which concealed him from his enemies. The sudden arrest of his motion, the abrasion of one of his hands on the gravel, restored him, and he wept with delight. He dug his fingers into the sand, threw it over himself in handfuls and audibly blessed it. It looked like diamonds, rubies, emeralds; he could think of nothing beautiful which it did not resemble. The trees upon the bank were giant garden plants; he noted a definite order in their arrangement, inhaled the fragrance of their blooms. A strange, roseate light shone through the spaces among their trunks and the wind made in their branches the music of olian harps. He had no wish to perfect his escape--was content to remain in that enchanting spot until retaken.  <br><br>  A whiz and rattle of grapeshot among the branches high above his head roused him from his dream. The baffled cannoneer had fired him a random farewell. He sprang to his feet, rushed up the sloping bank, and plunged into the forest.  <br><br>  All that day he traveled, laying his course by the rounding sun. The forest seemed interminable; nowhere did he discover a break in it, not even a woodman's road. He had not known that he lived in so wild a region. There was something uncanny in the revelation.  <br><br>  By nightfall he was fatigued, footsore, famishing. The thought of his wife and children urged him on. At last he found a road which led him in what he knew to be the right direction. It was as wide and straight as a city street, yet it seemed untraveled. No fields bordered it, no dwelling anywhere. Not so much as the barking of a dog suggested human habitation. The black bodies of the trees formed a straight wall on both sides, terminating on the horizon in a point, like a diagram in a lesson in perspective. Overhead, as he looked up through this rift in the wood, shone great garden stars looking unfamiliar and grouped in strange constellations. He was sure they were arranged in some order which had a secret and malign significance. The wood on either side was full of singular noises, among which--once, twice, and again--he distinctly heard whispers in an unknown tongue.  <br><br>  His neck was in pain and lifting his hand to it found it horribly swollen. He knew that it had a circle of black where the rope had bruised it. His eyes felt congested; he could no longer close them. His tongue was swollen with thirst; he relieved its fever by thrusting it forward from between his teeth into the cold air. How softly the turf had carpeted the untraveled avenue--he could no longer feel the roadway beneath his feet!  <br><br>  Doubtless, despite his suffering, he had fallen asleep while walking, for now he sees another scene--perhaps he has merely recovered from a delirium. He stands at the gate of his own home. All is as he left it, and all bright and beautiful in the morning sunshine. He must have traveled the entire night. As he pushes open the gate and passes up the wide white walk, he sees a flutter of female garments; his wife, looking fresh and cool and sweet, steps down from the veranda to meet him. At the bottom of the steps she stands waiting, with a smile of ineffable joy, an attitude of matchless grace and dignity. Ah, how beautiful she is! He springs forward with extended arms. As he is about to clasp her he feels a stunning blow upon the back of the neck; a blinding white light blazes all about him with a sound like the shock of a cannon--then all is darkness and silence!  <br><br>  Peyton Farquhar was dead; his body, with a broken neck, swung gently from side to side beneath the timbers of the Owl Creek bridge.  <br><br><em>Shhhh!</em> Friends don't tell friends how the story  ends!  That story is a great introduction to the short story writer's trick of the surprise or ""twist"" ending.<br><br>  The story is also known as <b>""A Dead Man's Dream.""</b>, but I didn't want to tell you that until <em>after</em> you were finished reading it ;- ).<br><br>"
2,A Dark Brown Dog - By Stephen Crane,"A Child was standing on a street-corner. He leaned with one shoulder against a high board-fence and swayed the other to and fro, the while kicking carelessly at the gravel.  <br><br>  Sunshine beat upon the cobbles, and a lazy summer wind raised yellow dust which trailed in clouds down the avenue. Clattering trucks moved with indistinctness through it. The child stood dreamily gazing.  <br><br>  After a time, a little dark-brown dog came trotting with an intent air down the sidewalk. A short rope was dragging from his neck. Occasionally he trod upon the end of it and stumbled.  <br><br>  He stopped opposite the child, and the two regarded each other. The dog hesitated for a moment, but presently he made some little advances with his tail. The child put out his hand and called him. In an apologetic manner the dog came close, and the two had an interchange of friendly pattings and waggles. The dog became more enthusiastic with each moment of the interview, until with his gleeful caperings he threatened to overturn the child. Whereupon the child lifted his hand and struck the dog a blow upon the head.  <br><br>  This thing seemed to overpower and astonish the little dark-brown dog, and wounded him to the heart. He sank down in despair at the child's feet. When the blow was repeated, together with an admonition in childish sentences, he turned over upon his back, and held his paws in a peculiar manner. At the same time with his ears and his eyes he offered a small prayer to the child.  <br><br>  <img style=""float:right; margin-left: 12px;"" itemprop=""image"" src=""http://cdn.americanliterature.com/al/images/story/a_dark_brown_dog_2.jpg"" alt=""Presently he struggled to his feet and started after the child."" pagespeed_url_hash=""116818995""/>  He looked so comical on his back, and holding his paws peculiarly, that the child was greatly amused and gave him little taps repeatedly, to keep him so. But the little dark-brown dog took this chastisement in the most serious way, and no doubt considered that he had committed some grave crime, for he wriggled contritely and showed his repentance in every way that was in his power. He pleaded with the child and petitioned him, and offered more prayers.  <br><br>  At last the child grew weary of this amusement and turned toward home. The dog was praying at the time. He lay on his back and turned his eyes upon the retreating form.  <br><br>  Presently he struggled to his feet and started after the child. The latter wandered in a perfunctory way toward his home, stopping at times to investigate various matters. During one of these pauses he discovered the little dark-brown dog who was following him with the air of a footpad.  <br><br>  The child beat his pursuer with a small stick he had found. The dog lay down and prayed until the child had finished, and resumed his journey. Then he scrambled erect and took up the pursuit again.  <br><br>  On the way to his home the child turned many times and beat the dog, proclaiming with childish gestures that he held him in contempt as an unimportant dog, with no value save for a moment. For being this quality of animal the dog apologized and eloquently expressed regret, but he continued stealthily to follow the child. His manner grew so very guilty that he slunk like an assassin.  <br><br>  When the child reached his door-step, the dog was industriously ambling a few yards in the rear. He became so agitated with shame when he again confronted the child that he forgot the dragging rope. He tripped upon it and fell forward.  <br><br>  <img style=""float:left; margin-left: 8px; margin-right: 12px; margin-bottom: 10px;"" itemprop=""image"" src=""http://cdn.americanliterature.com/al/images/story/a_dark_brown_dog_3.jpg"" alt=""The child attempts to drag the dark brown dog"" pagespeed_url_hash=""411318916""/>  The child sat down on the step and the two had another interview. During it the dog greatly exerted himself to please the child. He performed a few gambols with such abandon that the child suddenly saw him to be a valuable thing. He made a swift, avaricious charge and seized the rope.  <br><br>  He dragged his captive into a hall and up many long stairways in a dark tenement. The dog made willing efforts, but he could not hobble very skillfully up the stairs because he was very small and soft, and at last the pace of the engrossed child grew so energetic that the dog became panic-stricken. In his mind he was being dragged toward a grim unknown. His eyes grew wild with the terror of it. He began to wiggle his head frantically and to brace his legs.  <br><br>  The child redoubled his exertions. They had a battle on the stairs. The child was victorious because he was completely absorbed in his purpose, and because the dog was very small. He dragged his acquirement to the door of his home, and finally with triumph across the threshold.  <br><br>  <img style=""float:right; margin-left: 12px;"" itemprop=""image"" src=""http://cdn.americanliterature.com/al/images/story/a_dark_brown_dog_4.jpg"" alt=""Presently he struggled to his feet and started after the child."" pagespeed_url_hash=""705818837""/>  No one was in. The child sat down on the floor and made overtures to the dog. These the dog instantly accepted. He beamed with affection upon his new friend. In a short time they were firm and abiding comrades.  <br><br>  When the child's family appeared, they made a great row. The dog was examined and commented upon and called names. Scorn was leveled at him from all eyes, so that he became much embarrassed and drooped like a scorched plant. But the child went sturdily to the center of the floor, and, at the top of his voice, championed the dog. It happened that he was roaring protestations, with his arms clasped about the dog's neck, when the father of the family came in from work.  <br><br>  The parent demanded to know what the blazes they were making the kid howl for. It was explained in many words that the infernal kid wanted to introduce a disreputable dog into the family.  <br><br>  A family council was held. On this depended the dog's fate, but he in no way heeded, being busily engaged in chewing the end of the child's dress.  <br><br>  The affair was quickly ended. The father of the family, it appears, was in a particularly savage temper that evening, and when he perceived that it would amaze and anger everybody if such a dog were allowed to remain, he decided that it should be so. The child, crying softly, took his friend off to a retired part of the room to hobnob with him, while the father quelled a fierce rebellion of his wife. So it came to pass that the dog was a member of the household.  <br><br>  He and the child were associated together at all times save when the child slept. The child became a guardian and a friend. If the large folk kicked the dog and threw things at him, the child made loud and violent objections. Once when the child had run, protesting loudly, with tears raining down his face and his arms outstretched, to protect his friend, he had been struck in the head with a very large saucepan from the hand of his father, enraged at some seeming lack of courtesy in the dog. Ever after, the family were careful how they threw things at the dog. Moreover, the latter grew very skilful in avoiding missiles and feet. In a small room containing a stove, a table, a bureau and some chairs, he would display strategic ability of a high order, dodging, feinting and scuttling about among the furniture. He could force three or four people armed with brooms, sticks and handfuls of coal, to use all their ingenuity to get in a blow. And even when they did, it was seldom that they could do him a serious injury or leave any imprint.  <br><br>  But when the child was present, these scenes did not occur. It came to be recognized that if the dog was molested, the child would burst into sobs, and as the child, when started, was very riotous and practically unquenchable, the dog had therein a safeguard.  <br><br>  However, the child could not always be near. At night, when he was asleep, his dark-brown friend would raise from some black corner a wild, wailful cry, a song of infinite lowliness and despair, that would go shuddering and sobbing among the buildings of the block and cause people to swear. At these times the singer would often be chased all over the kitchen and hit with a great variety of articles.  <br><br>  Sometimes, too, the child himself used to beat the dog, although it is not known that he ever had what could be truly called a just cause. The dog always accepted these thrashings with an air of admitted guilt. He was too much of a dog to try to look to be a martyr or to plot revenge. He received the blows with deep humility, and furthermore he forgave his friend the moment the child had finished, and was ready to caress the child's hand with his little red tongue.  <br><br>  When misfortune came upon the child, and his troubles overwhelmed him, he would often crawl under the table and lay his small distressed head on the dog's back. The dog was ever sympathetic. It is not to be supposed that at such times he took occasion to refer to the unjust beatings his friend, when provoked, had administered to him.  <br><br>  He did not achieve any notable degree of intimacy with the other members of the family. He had no confidence in them, and the fear that he would express at their casual approach often exasperated them exceedingly. They used to gain a certain satisfaction in underfeeding him, but finally his friend the child grew to watch the matter with some care, and when he forgot it, the dog was often successful in secret for himself.  <br><br>  So the dog prospered. He developed a large bark, which came wondrously from such a small rug of a dog. He ceased to howl persistently at night. Sometimes, indeed, in his sleep, he would utter little yells, as from pain, but that occurred, no doubt, when in his dreams he encountered huge flaming dogs who threatened him direfully.  <br><br>  His devotion to the child grew until it was a sublime thing. He wagged at his approach; he sank down in despair at his departure. He could detect the sound of the child's step among all the noises of the neighborhood. It was like a calling voice to him.  <br><br>  The scene of their companionship was a kingdom governed by this terrible potentate, the child; but neither criticism nor rebellion ever lived for an instant in the heart of the one subject. Down in the mystic, hidden fields of his little dog-soul bloomed flowers of love and fidelity and perfect faith.  <br><br>  The child was in the habit of going on many expeditions to observe strange things in the vicinity. On these occasions his friend usually jogged aimfully along behind. Perhaps, though, he went ahead. This necessitated his turning around every quarter-minute to make sure the child was coming. He was filled with a large idea of the importance of these journeys. He would carry himself with such an air! He was proud to be the retainer of so great a monarch.  <br><br>  One day, however, the father of the family got quite exceptionally drunk. He came home and held carnival with the cooking utensils, the furniture and his wife. He was in the midst of this recreation when the child, followed by the dark-brown dog, entered the room. They were returning from their voyages.  <br><br>  <img style=""float:right; margin-left: 12px;"" itemprop=""image"" src=""http://cdn.americanliterature.com/al/images/story/a_dark_brown_dog_5.jpg"" alt=""He was the picture of a little dark-brown dog en route to a friend."" pagespeed_url_hash=""1000318758""/>  The child's practised eye instantly noted his father's state. He dived under the table, where experience had taught him was a rather safe place. The dog, lacking skill in such matters, was, of course, unaware of the true condition of affairs. He looked with interested eyes at his friend's sudden dive. He interpreted it to mean: Joyous gambol. He started to patter across the floor to join him. He was the picture of a little dark-brown dog en route to a friend.  <br><br>  The head of the family saw him at this moment. He gave a huge howl of joy, and knocked the dog down with a heavy coffee-pot. The dog, yelling in supreme astonishment and fear, writhed to his feet and ran for cover. The man kicked out with a ponderous foot. It caused the dog to swerve as if caught in a tide. A second blow of the coffee-pot laid him upon the floor.  <br><br>  Here the child, uttering loud cries, came valiantly forth like a knight. The father of the family paid no attention to these calls of the child, but advanced with glee upon the dog. Upon being knocked down twice in swift succession, the latter apparently gave up all hope of escape. He rolled over on his back and held his paws in a peculiar manner. At the same time with his eyes and his ears he offered up a small prayer.  <br><br>  But the father was in a mood for having fun, and it occurred to him that it would be a fine thing to throw the dog out of the window. So he reached down and grabbing the animal by a leg, lifted him, squirming, up. He swung him two or three times hilariously about his head, and then flung him with great accuracy through the window.  <br><br>  The soaring dog created a surprise in the block. A woman watering plants in an opposite window gave an involuntary shout and dropped a flower-pot. A man in another window leaned perilously out to watch the flight of the dog. A woman, who had been hanging out clothes in a yard, began to caper wildly. Her mouth was filled with clothes-pins, but her arms gave vent to a sort of exclamation. In appearance she was like a gagged prisoner. Children ran whooping.  <br><br>  The dark-brown body crashed in a heap on the roof of a shed five stories below. From thence it rolled to the pavement of an alleyway.  <br><br>  The child in the room far above burst into a long, dirgelike cry, and toddled hastily out of the room. It took him a long time to reach the alley, because his size compelled him to go downstairs backward, one step at a time, and holding with both hands to the step above.  <img style=""float:right; margin-left: 12px; margin-top:12px; itemprop="" image"" src=""http://cdn.americanliterature.com/al/images/story/a_dark_brown_dog_6.jpg"" alt=""...they found him seated by the body of his dark-brown friend."" pagespeed_url_hash=""1294818679""/>  <br><br>  When they came for him later, they found him seated by the body of his dark-brown friend.  <br><br>"
3,The Gift Of The Magi - By O. Henry,"  ONE DOLLAR AND EIGHTY-SEVEN CENTS. THAT WAS ALL. AND SIXTY CENTS of it was in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one's cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied. Three times Della counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas.  <br><br>  There was clearly nothing left to do but flop down on the shabby little couch and howl. So Della did it. Which instigates the moral reflection that life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles predominating.  <br><br>  While the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the first stage to the second, take a look at the home. A furnished flat at $8 per week. It did not exactly beggar description, but it certainly had that word on the look-out for the mendicancy squad.  <br><br>  In the vestibule below was a letter-box into which no letter would go, and an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax a ring. Also appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the name ""Mr. James Dillingham Young.""  <br><br>  The ""Dillingham"" had been flung to the breeze during a former period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid $30 per week. Now, when the income was shrunk to $20, the letters of ""Dillingham"" looked blurred, as though they were thinking seriously of contracting to a modest and unassuming D. But whenever Mr. James Dillingham Young came home and reached his flat above he was called ""Jim"" and greatly hugged by Mrs. James Dillingham Young, already introduced to you as Della. Which is all very good.  <br><br>  Della finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag. She stood by the window and looked out dully at a grey cat walking a grey fence in a grey backyard. To-morrow would be Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a present. She had been saving every penny she could for months, with this result. Twenty dollars a week doesn't go far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated. They always are. Only $1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him. Something fine and rare and sterling--something just a little bit near to being worthy of the honour of being owned by Jim.  <br><br>  There was a pier-glass between the windows of the room. Perhaps you have seen a pier-glass in an $8 Bat. A very thin and very agile person may, by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips, obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks. Della, being slender, had mastered the art.  <br><br>  Suddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass. Her eyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its colour within twenty seconds. Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length.  <br><br>  Now, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in which they both took a mighty pride. One was Jim's gold watch that had been his father's and his grandfather's. The other was Della's hair. Had the Queen of Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang out of the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty's jewels and gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in the basement, Jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from envy.  <br><br>  So now Della's beautiful hair fell about her, rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters. It reached below her knee and made itself almost a garment for her. And then she did it up again nervously and quickly. Once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet.  <br><br>  On went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat. With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes, she cluttered out of the door and down the stairs to the street.  <br><br>  Where she stopped the sign read: ""Mme Sofronie. Hair Goods of All Kinds."" One Eight up Della ran, and collected herself, panting. Madame, large, too white, chilly, hardly looked the ""Sofronie.""  <br><br>  ""Will you buy my hair?"" asked Della.  <br><br>  ""I buy hair,"" said Madame. ""Take yer hat off and let's have a sight at the looks of it.""  <br><br>  Down rippled the brown cascade.  <br><br>  ""Twenty dollars,"" said Madame, lifting the mass with a practised hand.  <br><br>  ""Give it to me quick"" said Della.  <br><br>  Oh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget the hashed metaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim's present.  <br><br>  She found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else. There was no other like it in any of the stores, and she had turned all of them inside out. It was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design, properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation--as all good things should do. It was even worthy of The Watch. As soon as she saw it she knew that it must be Jim's. It was like him. Quietness and value--the description applied to both. Twenty-one dollars they took from her for it, and she hurried home with the 78 cents. With that chain on his watch Jim might be properly anxious about the time in any company. Grand as the watch was, he sometimes looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he used in place of a chain.  <br><br>  When Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence and reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love. Which is always a tremendous task dear friends--a mammoth task.  <br><br>  Within forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls that made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy. She looked at her reflection in the mirror long, carefully, and critically.  <br><br>  ""If Jim doesn't kill me,"" she said to herself, ""before he takes a second look at me, he'll say I look like a Coney Island chorus girl. But what could I do--oh! what could I do with a dollar and eighty-seven cents?""  <br><br>  At 7 o'clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on the back of the stove hot and ready to cook the chops.  <br><br>  Jim was never late. Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on the corner of the table near the door that he always entered. Then she heard his step on the stair away down on the first flight, and she turned white for just a moment. She had a habit of saying little silent prayers about the simplest everyday things, and now she whispered: ""Please, God, make him think I am still pretty.""  <br><br>  The door opened and Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked thin and very serious. Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two--and to be burdened with a family! He needed a new overcoat and he was with out gloves.  <br><br>  Jim stepped inside the door, as immovable as a setter at the scent of quail. His eyes were fixed upon Della, and there was an expression in them that she could not read, and it terrified her. It was not anger, nor surprise, nor disapproval, nor horror, nor any of the sentiments that she had been prepared for. He simply stared at her fixedly with that peculiar expression on his face.  <br><br>  Della wriggled off the table and went for him.  <br><br>  ""Jim, darling,"" she cried, ""don't look at me that way. I had my hair cut off and sold it because I couldn't have lived through Christmas without giving you a present. It'll grow out again--you won't mind, will you? I just had to do it. My hair grows awfully fast. Say 'Merry Christmas!' Jim, and let's be happy. You don't know what a nice-what a beautiful, nice gift I've got for you.""  <br><br>  ""You've cut off your hair?"" asked Jim, laboriously, as if he had not arrived at that patent fact yet, even after the hardest mental labour.  <br><br>  ""Cut it off and sold it,"" said Della. ""Don't you like me just as well, anyhow? I'm me without my hair, ain't I?""  <br><br>  Jim looked about the room curiously.  <br><br>  ""You say your hair is gone?"" he said, with an air almost of idiocy.  <br><br>  ""You needn't look for it,"" said Della. ""It's sold, I tell you--sold and gone, too. It's Christmas Eve, boy. Be good to me, for it went for you. Maybe the hairs of my head were numbered,"" she went on with a sudden serious sweetness, ""but nobody could ever count my love for you. Shall I put the chops on, Jim?""  <br><br>  Out of his trance Jim seemed quickly to wake. He enfolded his Della. For ten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in the other direction. Eight dollars a week or a million a year--what is the difference? A mathematician or a wit would give you the wrong answer. The magi brought valuable gifts, but that was not among them. I his dark assertion will be illuminated later on.  <br><br>  Jim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it upon the table.  <br><br>  ""Don't make any mistake, Dell,"" he said, ""about me. I don't think there's anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that could make me like my girl any less. But if you'll unwrap that package you may see why you had me going a while at first.""  <br><br>  White fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper. And then an ecstatic scream of joy; and then, alas! a quick feminine change to hysterical tears and wails, necessitating the immediate employment of all the comforting powers of the lord of the flat.  <br><br>  For there lay The Combs--the set of combs, side and back, that Della had worshipped for long in a Broadway window. Beautiful combs, pure tortoise-shell, with jewelled rims--just the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair. They were expensive combs, she knew, and her heart had simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of possession. And now, they were hers, but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone.  <br><br>  But she hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able to look up with dim eyes and a smile and say: ""My hair grows so fast, Jim!""  <br><br>  And then Della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried, ""Oh, oh!""  <br><br>  Jim had not yet seen his beautiful present. She held it out to him eagerly upon her open palm. The dull precious metal seemed to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit.  <br><br>  ""Isn't it a dandy, Jim? I hunted all over town to find it. You'll have to look at the time a hundred times a day now. Give me your watch. I want to see how it looks on it.""  <br><br>  Instead of obeying, Jim tumbled down on the couch and put his hands under the back of his head and smiled.  <br><br>  ""Dell,"" said he, ""let's put our Christmas presents away and keep 'em a while. They're too nice to use just at present. I sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs. And now suppose you put the chops on.""  <br><br>  The magi, as you know, were wise men--wonderfully wise men-who brought gifts to the Babe in the manger. They invented the art of giving Christmas presents. Being wise, their gifts were no doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication. And here I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house. But in a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest. Of all who give and receive gifts, such as they are wisest. Everywhere they are wisest. They are the magi.                             <br><br>"
4,The Monkey's Paw - By W.W. Jacobs,"  <b><i>""Be careful what you wish for, you may receive it.""</i> -- </b>Anonymous  <br><br>  <b>Part I</b>  <br><br>  Without, the night was cold and wet, but in the small parlour of Laburnum villa the blinds were drawn and the fire burned brightly. Father and son were at chess; the former, who possessed ideas about the game involving radical chances, putting his king into such sharp and unnecessary perils that it even provoked comment from the white-haired old lady knitting placidly by the fire.  <br><br>  ""Hark at the wind,"" said Mr. White, who, having seen a fatal mistake after it was too late, was amiably desirous of preventing his son from seeing it.  <br><br>  ""I'm listening,"" said the latter grimly surveying the board as he stretched out his hand. ""Check.""  <br><br>  ""I should hardly think that he's come tonight, "" said his father, with his hand poised over the board.  <br><br>  ""Mate,"" replied the son.  <br><br>  ""That's the worst of living so far out,"" balled Mr. White with sudden and unlooked-for violence; ""Of all the beastly, slushy, out of the way places to live in, this is the worst. Path's a bog, and the road's a torrent. I don't know what people are thinking about. I suppose because only two houses in the road are let, they think it doesn't matter.""  <br><br>    ""Never mind, dear,"" said his wife soothingly; ""perhaps you'll win the next one.""  <br><br>    Mr. White looked up sharply, just in time to intercept a knowing glance between mother and son. the words died away on his lips, and he hid a guilty grin in his thin grey beard.  <br><br>    ""There he is,"" said Herbert White as the gate banged to loudly and heavy footsteps came toward the door.  <br><br>    The old man rose with hospitable haste and opening the door, was heard condoling with the new arrival. The new arrival also condoled with himself, so that Mrs. White said, ""Tut, tut!"" and coughed gently as her husband entered the room followed by a tall, burly man, beady of eye and rubicund of visage.  <br><br>    ""Sargeant-Major Morris, "" he said, introducing him.  <br><br>    The Sargeant-Major took hands and taking the proffered seat by the fire, watched contentedly as his host got out whiskey and tumblers and stood a small copper kettle on the fire.  <br><br>    At the third glass his eyes got brighter, and he began to talk, the little family circle regarding with eager interest this visitor from distant parts, as he squared his broad shoulders in the chair and spoke of wild scenes and doughty deeds; of wars and plagues and strange peoples.  <br><br>    ""Twenty-one years of it,"" said Mr. White, nodding at his wife and son. ""When he went away he was a slip of a youth in the warehouse. Now look at him.""  <br><br>    ""He don't look to have taken much harm."" said Mrs. White politely.  <br><br>    ""I'd like to go to India myself,"" said the old man, just to look around a bit, you know.""  <br><br>    ""Better where you are,"" said the Sargeant-Major, shaking his head. He put down the empty glass and sighning softly, shook it again.  <br><br>    ""I should like to see those old temples and fakirs and jugglers,"" said the old man. ""what was that that you started telling me the other day about a monkey's paw or something, Morris?""  <br><br>    ""Nothing."" said the soldier hastily. ""Leastways, nothing worth hearing.""  <br><br>    ""Monkey's paw?"" said Mrs. White curiously.  <br><br>    ""Well, it's just a bit of what you might call magic, perhaps."" said the Sargeant-Major off-handedly.  <br><br>    His three listeners leaned forward eagerly. The visitor absent-mindedly put his empty glass to his lips and then set it down again. His host filled it for him again.  <br><br>    ""To look at,"" said the Sargeant-Major, fumbling in his pocket, ""it's just an ordinary little paw, dried to a mummy.""  <br><br>    He took something out of his pocket and proffered it. Mrs. White drew back with a grimace, but her son, taking it, examined it curiously.  <br><br>    ""And what is there special about it?"" inquired Mr. White as he took it from his son, and having examined it, placed it upon the table.  <br><br>    ""It had a spell put on it by an old Fakir,"" said the Sargeant-Major, ""a very holy man. He wanted to show that fate ruled people's lives, and that those who interfered with it did so to their sorrow. He put a spell on it so that three separate men could each have three wishes from it.""  <br><br>    His manners were so impressive that his hearers were conscious that their light laughter had jarred somewhat.  <br><br>    ""Well, why don't you have three, sir?"" said Herbert White cleverly.  <br><br>    The soldier regarded him the way that middle age is wont to regard presumptuous youth.""I have,"" he said quietly, and his blotchy face whitened.  <br><br>    ""And did you really have the three wishes granted?"" asked Mrs. White.  <br><br>    ""I did,"" said the seargent-major, and his glass tapped against his strong teeth.  <br><br>    ""And has anybody else wished?"" persisted the old lady.  <br><br>    ""The first man had his three wishes. Yes, "" was the reply, ""I don't know what the first two were, but the third was for death. That's how I got the paw.""  <br><br>    His tones were so grave that a hush fell upon the group.  <br><br>    ""If you've had your three wishes it's no good to you now then Morris,"" said the old man at last. ""What do you keep it for?""  <br><br>    The soldier shook his head. ""Fancy I suppose,"" he said slowly."" I did have some idea of selling it, but I don't think I will. It has caused me enough mischief already. Besides, people won't buy. They think it's a fairy tale, some of them; and those who do think anything of it want to try it first and pay me afterward.""  <br><br>    ""If you could have another three wishes,"" said the old man, eyeing him keenly,"" would you have them?""  <br><br>    ""I don't know,"" said the other. ""I don't know.""  <br><br>    He took the paw, and dangling it between his forefinger and thumb, suddenly threw it upon the fire. White, with a slight cry, stooped down and snatched it off.  <br><br>    ""Better let it burn,"" said the soldier solemnly.  <br><br>    ""If you don't want it Morris,"" said the other, ""give it to me.""  <br><br>    ""I won't."" said his friend doggedly. ""I threw it on the fire. If you keep it, don't blame me for what happens. Pitch it on the fire like a sensible man.""  <br><br>    The other shook his head and examined his possession closely. ""How do you do it?"" he inquired.  <br><br>    ""Hold it up in your right hand, and wish aloud,"" said the Sargeant-Major, ""But I warn you of the consequences.""  <br><br>    ""Sounds like the 'Arabian Nights'"", said Mrs. White, as she rose and began to set the supper. ""Don't you think you might wish for four pairs of hands for me.""  <br><br>    Her husband drew the talisman from his pocket, and all three burst into laughter as the Seargent-Major, with a look of alarm on his face, caught him by the arm.  <br><br>    ""If you must wish,"" he said gruffly, ""Wish for something sensible.""  <br><br>    Mr. White dropped it back in his pocket, and placing chairs, motioned his friend to the table. In the business of supper the talisman was partly forgotten, and afterward the three sat listening in an enthralled fashion to a second installment of the soldier's adventures in India.  <br><br>    ""If the tale about the monkey's paw is not more truthful than those he has been telling us,"" said Herbert, as the door closed behind their guest, just in time to catch the last train, ""we shan't make much out of it.""  <br><br>    ""Did you give anything for it, father?"" inquired Mrs. White, regarding her husband closely.  <br><br>    ""A trifle,"" said he, colouring slightly, ""He didn't want it, but I made him take it. And he pressed me again to throw it away.""  <br><br>    ""Likely,"" said Herbert, with pretended horror. ""Why, we're going to be rich, and famous, and happy. Wish to be an emperor, father, to begin with; then you can't be henpecked.""  <br><br>    He darted around the table, pursued by the maligned Mrs White armed with an antimacassar.  <br><br>    Mr. White took the paw from his pocket and eyed it dubiously. ""I don't know what to wish for, and that's a fact,"" he said slowly. It seems to me I've got all I want.""  <br><br>    ""If you only cleared the house, you'd be quite happy, wouldn't you!"" said Herbert, with his hand on his shoulder. ""Well, wish for two hundred pounds, then; that'll just do it.""  <br><br>    His father, smiling shamefacedly at his own credulity, held up the talisman, as his son, with a solemn face, somewhat marred by a wink at his mother, sat down and struck a few impressive chords.  <br><br>    ""I wish for two hundred pounds,"" said the old man distinctly.  <br><br>    A fine crash from the piano greeted his words, interrupted by a shuddering cry from the old man. His wife and son ran toward him.  <br><br>    ""It moved,"" he cried, with a glance of disgust at the object as it lay on the floor. ""As I wished, it twisted in my hand like a snake.""  <br><br>    ""Well, I don't see the money,"" said his son, as he picked it up and placed it on the table, ""and I bet I never shall.""  <br><br>    ""It must have been your fancy, father,"" said his wife, regarding him anxiously.  <br><br>    He shook his head. ""Never mind, though; there's no harm done, but it gave me a shock all the same.""  <br><br>    They sat down by the fire again while the two men finished their pipes. Outside, the wind was higher than ever, an the old man started nervously at the sound of a door banging upstairs. A silence unusual and depressing settled on all three, which lasted until the old couple rose to retire for the rest of the night.  <br><br>    ""I expect you'll find the cash tied up in a big bag in the middle of your bed,"" said Herbert, as he bade them good night, "" and something horrible squatting on top of your wardrobe watching you as you pocket your ill-gotten gains.""  <br><br>    He sat alone in the darkness, gazing at the dying fire, and seeing faces in it. The last was so horrible and so simian that he gazed at it in amazement. It got so vivid that, with a little uneasy laugh, he felt on the table for a glass containing a little water to throw over it. His hand grasped the monkey's paw, and with a little shiver he wiped his hand on his coat and went up to bed.  <br><br>    <b>Part II</b>  <br><br>    In the brightness of the wintry sun next morning as it streamed over the breakfast table he laughed at his fears. There was an air of prosaic wholesomeness about the room which it had lacked on the previous night, and the dirty, shriveled little paw was pitched on the side-board with a carelessness which betokened no great belief in its virtues.  <br><br>    ""I suppose all old soldiers are the same,"" said Mrs White. ""The idea of our listening to such nonsense! How could wishes be granted in these days? And if they could, how could two hundred pounds hurt you, father?""  <br><br>    ""Might drop on his head from the sky,"" said the frivolous Herbert.  <br><br>    ""Morris said the things happened so naturally,"" said his father, ""that you might if you so wished attribute it to coincidence.""  <br><br>    ""Well don't break into the money before I come back,"" said Herbert as he rose from the table. ""I'm afraid it'll turn you into a mean, avaricious man, and we shall have to disown you.""  <br><br>    His mother laughed, and following him to the door, watched him down the road; and returning to the breakfast table, was very happy at the expense of her husband's credulity. All of which did not prevent her from scurrying to the door at the postman's knock, nor prevent her from referring somewhat shortly to retired Sargeant-Majors of bibulous habits when she found that the post brought a tailor's bill.  <br><br>    ""Herbert will have some more of his funny remarks, I expect, when he comes home,"" she said as they sat at dinner.  <br><br>    ""I dare say,"" said Mr. White, pouring himself out some beer; ""but for all that, the thing moved in my hand; that I'll swear to.""  <br><br>    ""You thought it did,"" said the old lady soothingly.  <br><br>    ""I say it did,"" replied the other. ""There was no thought about it; I had just - What's the matter?""  <br><br>    His wife made no reply. She was watching the mysterious movements of a man outside, who, peering in an undecided fashion at the house, appeared to be trying to make up his mind to enter. In mental connexion with the two hundred pounds, she noticed that the stranger was well dressed, and wore a silk hat of glossy newness. Three times he paused at the gate, and then walked on again. The fourth time he stood with his hand upon it, and then with sudden resolution flung it open and walked up the path. Mrs White at the same moment placed her hands behind her, and hurriedly unfastening the strings of her apron, put that useful article of apparel beneath the cushion of her chair.  <br><br>    She brought the stranger, who seemed ill at ease, into the room. He gazed at her furtively, and listened in a preoccupied fashion as the old lady apologized for the appearance of the room, and her husband's coat, a garment which he usually reserved for the garden. She then waited as patiently as her sex would permit for him to broach his business, but he was at first strangely silent.  <br><br>    ""I - was asked to call,"" he said at last, and stooped and picked a piece of cotton from his trousers. ""I come from 'Maw and Meggins.' ""  <br><br>    The old lady started. ""Is anything the matter?"" she asked breathlessly. ""Has anything happened to Herbert? What is it? What is it?  <br><br>    Her husband interposed. ""There there mother,"" he said hastily. ""Sit down, and don't jump to conclusions. You've not brought bad news, I'm sure sir,"" and eyed the other wistfully.  <br><br>    ""I'm sorry - "" began the visitor.  <br><br>    ""Is he hurt?"" demanded the mother wildly.  <br><br>    The visitor bowed in assent.""Badly hurt,"" he said quietly, ""but he is not in any pain.""  <br><br>    ""Oh thank God!"" said the old woman, clasping her hands. ""Thank God for that! Thank - ""  <br><br>    She broke off as the sinister meaning of the assurance dawned on her and she saw the awful confirmation of her fears in the others averted face. She caught her breath, and turning to her slower-witted husband, laid her trembling hand on his. There was a long silence.  <br><br>    ""He was caught in the machinery,"" said the visitor at length in a low voice.  <br><br>    ""Caught in the machinery,"" repeated Mr. White, in a dazed fashion,""yes.""  <br><br>    He sat staring out the window, and taking his wife's hand between his own, pressed it as he had been wont to do in their old courting days nearly forty years before.  <br><br>    ""He was the only one left to us,"" he said, turning gently to the visitor. ""It is hard.""  <br><br>    The other coughed, and rising, walked slowly to the window. "" The firm wishes me to convey their sincere sympathy with you in your great loss,"" he said, without looking round. ""I beg that you will understand I am only their servant and merely obeying orders.""  <br><br>    There was no reply; the old woman’s face was white, her eyes staring, and her breath inaudible; on the husband's face was a look such as his friend the sargeant might have carried into his first action.  <br><br>    ""I was to say that Maw and Meggins disclaim all responsibility,"" continued the other. ""They admit no liability at all, but in consideration of your son's services, they wish to present you with a certain sum as compensation.""  <br><br>    Mr. White dropped his wife's hand, and rising to his feet, gazed with a look of horror at his visitor. His dry lips shaped the words, ""How much?""  <br><br>    ""Two hundred pounds,"" was the answer.  <br><br>    Unconscious of his wife's shriek, the old man smiled faintly, put out his hands like a sightless man, and dropped, a senseless heap, to the floor.  <br><br>    <b>Part III</b>  <br><br>    In the huge new cemetery, some two miles distant, the old people buried their dead, and came back to the house steeped in shadows and silence. It was all over so quickly that at first they could hardly realize it, and remained in a state of expectation as though of something else to happen - something else which was to lighten this load, too heavy for old hearts to bear.  <br><br>    But the days passed, and expectations gave way to resignation - the hopeless resignation of the old, sometimes mis-called apathy. Sometimes they hardly exchanged a word, for now they had nothing to talk about, and their days were long to weariness.  <br><br>    It was a about a week after that the old man, waking suddenly in the night, stretched out his hand and found himself alone. The room was in darkness, and the sound of subdued weeping came from the window. He raised himself in bed and listened.  <br><br>    ""Come back,"" he said tenderly. ""You will be cold.""  <br><br>    ""It is colder for my son,"" said the old woman, and wept afresh.  <br><br>    The sounds of her sobs died away on his ears. The bed was warm, and his eyes heavy with sleep. He dozed fitfully, and then slept until a sudden wild cry from his wife awoke him with a start.  <br><br>    ""THE PAW!"" she cried wildly. ""THE MONKEY'S PAW!""  <br><br>    He started up in alarm. ""Where? Where is it? What’s the matter?""  <br><br>    She came stumbling across the room toward him. ""I want it,"" she said quietly. ""You've not destroyed it?""  <br><br>    ""It's in the parlour, on the bracket,"" he replied, marveling. ""Why?""  <br><br>    She cried and laughed together, and bending over, kissed his cheek.  <br><br>    ""I only just thought of it,"" she said hysterically. ""Why didn't I think of it before? Why didn't you think of it?""  <br><br>    ""Think of what?"" he questioned.  <br><br>    ""The other two wishes,"" she replied rapidly. ""We've only had one.""  <br><br>    ""Was not that enough?"" he demanded fiercely.  <br><br>    ""No,"" she cried triumphantly; ""We'll have one more. Go down and get it quickly, and wish our boy alive again.""  <br><br>    The man sat in bed and flung the bedclothes from his quaking limbs.""Good God, you are mad!"" he cried aghast. ""Get it,"" she panted; ""get it quickly, and wish - Oh my boy, my boy!""  <br><br>    Her husband struck a match and lit the candle. ""Get back to bed he said unsteadily. ""You don't know what you are saying.""  <br><br>    ""We had the first wish granted,"" said the old woman, feverishly; ""why not the second?""  <br><br>    ""A coincidence,"" stammered the old man.  <br><br>    ""Go get it and wish,"" cried his wife, quivering with excitement.  <br><br>    The old man turned and regarded her, and his voice shook. ""He has been dead ten days, and besides he - I would not tell you else, but - I could only recognize him by his clothing. If he was too terrible for you to see then, how now?""  <br><br>    ""Bring him back,"" cried the old woman, and dragged him towards the door. ""Do you think I fear the child I have nursed?""  <br><br>    He went down in the darkness, and felt his way to the parlour, and then to the mantlepiece. The talisman was in its place, and a horrible fear that the unspoken wish might bring his mutilated son before him ere he could escape from the room seized up on him, and he caught his breath as he found that he had lost the direction of the door. His brow cold with sweat, he felt his way round the table, and groped along the wall until he found himself in the small passage with the unwholesome thing in his hand.  <br><br>    Even his wife's face seemed changed as he entered the room. It was white and expectant, and to his fears seemed to have an unnatural look upon it. He was afraid of her.  <br><br>    ""WISH!"" she cried in a strong voice.  <br><br>    ""It is foolish and wicked,"" he faltered.  <br><br>    ""WISH!"" repeated his wife.  <br><br>    He raised his hand. ""I wish my son alive again.""  <br><br>    The talisman fell to the floor, and he regarded it fearfully. Then he sank trembling into a chair as the old woman, with burning eyes, walked to the window and raised the blind.  <br><br>    He sat until he was chilled with the cold, glancing occasionally at the figure of the old woman peering through the window. The candle-end, which had burned below the rim of the china candlestick, was throwing pulsating shadows on the ceiling and walls, until with a flicker larger than the rest, it expired. The old man, with an unspeakable sense of relief at the failure of the talisman, crept back back to his bed, and a minute afterward the old woman came silently and apathetically beside him.  <br><br>    Neither spoke, but lat silently listening to the ticking of the clock. A stair creaked, and a squeaky mouse scurried noisily through the wall. The darkness was oppressive, and after lying for some time screwing up his courage, he took the box of matches, and striking one, went downstairs for a candle.  <br><br>    At the foot of the stairs the match went out, and he paused to strike another; and at the same moment a knock came so quiet and stealthy as to be scarcely audible, sounded on the front door.  <br><br>    The matches fell from his hand and spilled in the passage. He stood motionless, his breath suspended until the knock was repeated. Then he turned and fled swiftly back to his room, and closed the door behind him. A third knock sounded through the house.  <br><br>    <em>""WHAT’S THAT?""</em> cried the old woman, starting up.  <br><br>    ""A rat,"" said the old man in shaking tones - ""a rat. It passed me on the stairs.""  <br><br>    His wife sat up in bed listening. A loud knock resounded through the house.  <br><br>    ""It's Herbert!""  <br><br>    She ran to the door, but her husband was before her, and catching her by the arm, held her tightly.  <br><br>    ""What are you going to do?"" he whispered hoarsely.  <br><br>    ""It's my boy; it's Herbert!"" she cried, struggling mechanically. ""I forgot it was two miles away. What are you holding me for? Let go. I must open the door.""  <br><br>    ""For God's sake don't let it in,"" cried the old man, trembling.  <br><br>    ""You're afraid of your own son,"" she cried struggling. ""Let me go. I'm coming, Herbert; I'm coming.""  <br><br>    There was another knock, and another. The old woman with a sudden wrench broke free and ran from the room. Her husband followed to the landing, and called after her appealingly as she hurried downstairs. He heard the chain rattle back and the bolt drawn slowly and stiffly from the socket. Then the old woman’s voice, strained and panting.  <br><br>    ""The bolt,"" she cried loudly. ""Come down. I can't reach it.""  <br><br>    But her husband was on his hands and knees groping wildly on the floor in search of the paw. If only he could find it before the thing outside got in. A perfect fusillade of knocks reverberated throgh the house, and he heard the scraping of a chair as his wife as his wife put it down in the passage against the door. He heard the creaking of the bolt as it came slowly back, and at the same moment he found the monkey's paw, and frantically breathed his third and last wish.  <br><br>    The knocking ceased suddenly, although the echoes of it were still in the house. He heard the chair drawn back, and the door opened. A cold wind rushed up the staircase, and a long loud wail of disappointment and misery from his wife gave him the courage to run down to her side, and then to the gate beyond. The street lamp flickering opposite shone on a quiet and deserted road.                                <br><br>"
5,The Cask Of Amontillado - By Edgar Allan Poe,"THE thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could, but when he ventured upon insult I vowed revenge. You, who so well know the nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that gave utterance to a threat. At length I would be avenged; this was a point definitely, settled --but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved precluded the idea of risk. I must not only punish but punish with impunity. A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.  <br><br>  It must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given Fortunato cause to doubt my good will. I continued, as was my in to smile in his face, and he did not perceive that my to smile now was at the thought of his immolation.  <br><br>  He had a weak point --this Fortunato --although in other regards he was a man to be respected and even feared. He prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine. Few Italians have the true virtuoso spirit. For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and opportunity, to practise imposture upon the British and Austrian millionaires. In painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen, was a quack, but in the matter of old wines he was sincere. In this respect I did not differ from him materially; --I was skilful in the Italian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I could.  <br><br>  It was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season, that I encountered my friend. He accosted me with excessive warmth, for he had been drinking much. The man wore motley. He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells. I was so pleased to see him that I thought I should never have done wringing his hand.  <br><br>  I said to him --""My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met. How remarkably well you are looking to-day. But I have received a pipe of what passes for Amontillado, and I have my doubts.""  <br><br>  ""How?"" said he. ""Amontillado, A pipe? Impossible! And in the middle of the carnival!""  <br><br>  ""I have my doubts,"" I replied; ""and I was silly enough to pay the full Amontillado price without consulting you in the matter. You were not to be found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.""  <br><br>  ""Amontillado!""  <br><br>  ""I have my doubts.""  <br><br>  ""Amontillado!""  <br><br>  ""And I must satisfy them.""  <br><br>  ""Amontillado!""  <br><br>  ""As you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchresi. If any one has a critical turn it is he. He will tell me --""  <br><br>  ""Luchresi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.""  <br><br>  ""And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your own.  <br><br>  ""Come, let us go.""  <br><br>  ""Whither?""  <br><br>  ""To your vaults.""  <br><br>  ""My friend, no; I will not impose upon your good nature. I perceive you have an engagement. Luchresi--""  <br><br>  ""I have no engagement; --come.""  <br><br>  ""My friend, no. It is not the engagement, but the severe cold with which I perceive you are afflicted. The vaults are insufferably damp. They are encrusted with nitre.""  <br><br>  ""Let us go, nevertheless. The cold is merely nothing. Amontillado! You have been imposed upon. And as for Luchresi, he cannot distinguish Sherry from Amontillado.""  <br><br>  Thus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm; and putting on a mask of black silk and drawing a roquelaire closely about my person, I suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.  <br><br>  There were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make merry in honour of the time. I had told them that I should not return until the morning, and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house. These orders were sufficient, I well knew, to insure their immediate disappearance, one and all, as soon as my back was turned.  <br><br>  I took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to Fortunato, bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into the vaults. I passed down a long and winding staircase, requesting him to be cautious as he followed. We came at length to the foot of the descent, and stood together upon the damp ground of the catacombs of the Montresors.  <br><br>  The gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap jingled as he strode.  <br><br>  ""The pipe,"" he said.  <br><br>  ""It is farther on,"" said I; ""but observe the white web-work which gleams from these cavern walls.""  <br><br>  He turned towards me, and looked into my eves with two filmy orbs that distilled the rheum of intoxication.  <br><br>  ""Nitre?"" he asked, at length.  <br><br>  ""Nitre,"" I replied. ""How long have you had that cough?""  <br><br>  ""Ugh! ugh! ugh! --ugh! ugh! ugh! --ugh! ugh! ugh! --ugh! ugh! ugh! --ugh! ugh! ugh!""  <br><br>  My poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes.  <br><br>  ""It is nothing,"" he said, at last.  <br><br>  ""Come,"" I said, with decision, ""we will go back; your health is precious. You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, as once I was. You are a man to be missed. For me it is no matter. We will go back; you will be ill, and I cannot be responsible. Besides, there is Luchresi --""  <br><br>  ""Enough,"" he said; ""the cough's a mere nothing; it will not kill me. I shall not die of a cough.""  <br><br>  ""True --true,"" I replied; ""and, indeed, I had no intention of alarming you unnecessarily --but you should use all proper caution. A draught of this Medoc will defend us from the damps.  <br><br>  Here I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long row of its fellows that lay upon the mould.  <br><br>  ""Drink,"" I said, presenting him the wine. He raised it to his lips with a leer. He paused and nodded to me familiarly, while his bells jingled.  <br><br>  ""I drink,"" he said, ""to the buried that repose around us.""  <br><br>  ""And I to your long life.""  <br><br>  He again took my arm, and we proceeded.  <br><br>  ""These vaults,"" he said, ""are extensive.""  <br><br>  ""The Montresors,"" I replied, ""were a great and numerous family.""  <br><br>  ""I forget your arms.""  <br><br>  ""A huge human foot d'or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel.""  <br><br>  ""And the motto?""  <br><br>  ""Nemo me impune lacessit.""  <br><br>  ""Good!"" he said.  <br><br>  The wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled. My own fancy grew warm with the Medoc. We had passed through long walls of piled skeletons, with casks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost recesses of the catacombs. I paused again, and this time I made bold to seize Fortunato by an arm above the elbow.  <br><br>  ""The nitre!"" I said; ""see, it increases. It hangs like moss upon the vaults. We are below the river's bed. The drops of moisture trickle among the bones. Come, we will go back ere it is too late. Your cough --""  <br><br>  ""It is nothing,"" he said; ""let us go on. But first, another draught of the Medoc.""  <br><br>  I broke and reached him a flagon of De Grave. He emptied it at a breath. His eyes flashed with a fierce light. He laughed and threw the bottle upwards with a gesticulation I did not understand.  <br><br>  I looked at him in surprise. He repeated the movement --a grotesque one.  <br><br>  ""You do not comprehend?"" he said.  <br><br>  ""Not I,"" I replied.  <br><br>  ""Then you are not of the brotherhood.""  <br><br>  ""How?""  <br><br>  ""You are not of the masons.""  <br><br>  ""Yes, yes,"" I said; ""yes, yes.""  <br><br>  ""You? Impossible! A mason?""  <br><br>  ""A mason,"" I replied.  <br><br>  ""A sign,"" he said, ""a sign.""  <br><br>  ""It is this,"" I answered, producing from beneath the folds of my roquelaire a trowel.  <br><br>  ""You jest,"" he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces. ""But let us proceed to the Amontillado.""  <br><br>  ""Be it so,"" I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak and again offering him my arm. He leaned upon it heavily. We continued our route in search of the Amontillado. We passed through a range of low arches, descended, passed on, and descending again, arrived at a deep crypt, in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than flame.  <br><br>  At the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less spacious. Its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to the vault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of Paris. Three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner. From the fourth side the bones had been thrown down, and lay promiscuously upon the earth, forming at one point a mound of some size. Within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones, we perceived a still interior crypt or recess, in depth about four feet, in width three, in height six or seven. It seemed to have been constructed for no especial use within itself, but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs, and was backed by one of their circumscribing walls of solid granite.  <br><br>  It was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavoured to pry into the depth of the recess. Its termination the feeble light did not enable us to see.  <br><br>  ""Proceed,"" I said; ""herein is the Amontillado. As for Luchresi --""  <br><br>  ""He is an ignoramus,"" interrupted my friend, as he stepped unsteadily forward, while I followed immediately at his heels. In niche, and finding an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress arrested by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered. A moment more and I had fettered him to the granite. In its surface were two iron staples, distant from each other about two feet, horizontally. From one of these depended a short chain, from the other a padlock. Throwing the links about his waist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it. He was too much astounded to resist. Withdrawing the key I stepped back from the recess.  <br><br>  ""Pass your hand,"" I said, ""over the wall; you cannot help feeling the nitre. Indeed, it is very damp. Once more let me implore you to return. No? Then I must positively leave you. But I must first render you all the little attentions in my power.""  <br><br>  ""The Amontillado!"" ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from his astonishment.  <br><br>  ""True,"" I replied; ""the Amontillado.""  <br><br>  As I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of which I have before spoken. Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered a quantity of building stone and mortar. With these materials and with the aid of my trowel, I began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche.  <br><br>  I had scarcely laid the first tier of the masonry when I discovered that the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great measure worn off. The earliest indication I had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth of the recess. It was not the cry of a drunken man. There was then a long and obstinate silence. I laid the second tier, and the third, and the fourth; and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain. The noise lasted for several minutes, during which, that I might hearken to it with the more satisfaction, I ceased my labours and sat down upon the bones. When at last the clanking subsided, I resumed the trowel, and finished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh tier. The wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast. I again paused, and holding the flambeaux over the mason-work, threw a few feeble rays upon the figure within.  <br><br>  A succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from the throat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back. For a brief moment I hesitated, I trembled. Unsheathing my rapier, I began to grope with it about the recess; but the thought of an instant reassured me. I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs, and felt satisfied. I reapproached the wall; I replied to the yells of him who clamoured. I re-echoed, I aided, I surpassed them in volume and in strength. I did this, and the clamourer grew still.  <br><br>  It was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close. I had completed the eighth, the ninth and the tenth tier. I had finished a portion of the last and the eleventh; there remained but a single stone to be fitted and plastered in. I struggled with its weight; I placed it partially in its destined position. But now there came from out the niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head. It was succeeded by a sad voice, which I had difficulty in recognizing as that of the noble Fortunato. The voice said--  <br><br>  ""Ha! ha! ha! --he! he! he! --a very good joke, indeed --an excellent jest. We will have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo --he! he! he! --over our wine --he! he! he!""  <br><br>  ""The Amontillado!"" I said.  <br><br>  ""He! he! he! --he! he! he! --yes, the Amontillado. But is it not getting late? Will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo, the Lady Fortunato and the rest? Let us be gone.""  <br><br>  ""Yes,"" I said, ""let us be gone.""  <br><br>  ""For the love of God, Montresor!""  <br><br>  ""Yes,"" I said, ""for the love of God!""  <br><br>  But to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply. I grew impatient. I called aloud --  <br><br>  ""Fortunato!""  <br><br>  No answer. I called again --  <br><br>  ""Fortunato!""  <br><br>  No answer still. I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and let it fall within. There came forth in return only a jingling of the bells. My heart grew sick; it was the dampness of the catacombs that made it so. I hastened to make an end of my labour. I forced the last stone into its position; I plastered it up. Against the new masonry I re-erected the old rampart of bones. For the half of a century no mortal has disturbed them. In pace requiescat!  <br><br>  <b><small>THE END</small></b>                             <br><br>Readers that enjoyed this short story may also be interested in <a href=""/author/edgar-allan-poe/short-story/the-black-cat"">The Black Cat</a> and <a href=""/author/edgar-allan-poe/short-story/the-tell-tale-heart"">The Tell-Tale Heart</a>.<br><br>"
6,Eve's Diary - By Mark Twain,"  <em><b>Translated from the Original</b></em>  <br><br>    Then if I am an experiment, am I the whole of it? No, I think not; I think the rest of it is part of it. I am the main part of it, but I think the rest of it has its share in the matter. Is my position assured, or do I have to watch it and take care of it? The latter, perhaps. Some instinct tells me that eternal vigilance is the price of supremacy. [That is a good phrase, I think, for one so young.]<br><br>    Everything looks better today than it did yesterday. In the rush of finishing up yesterday, the mountains were left in a ragged condition, and some of the plains were so cluttered with rubbish and remnants that the aspects were quite distressing. Noble and beautiful works of art should not be subjected to haste; and this majestic new world is indeed a most noble and beautiful work. And certainly marvelously near to being perfect, notwithstanding the shortness of the time. There are too many stars in some places and not enough in others, but that can be remedied presently, no doubt. The moon got loose last night, and slid down and fell out of the scheme --a very great loss; it breaks my heart to think of it. There isn't another thing among the ornaments and decorations that is comparable to it for beauty and finish. It should have been fastened better. If we can only get it back again-- But of course there is no telling where it went to. And besides, whoever gets it will hide it; I know it because I would do it myself. I believe I can be honest in all other matters, but I already begin to realize that the core and center of my nature is love of the beautiful, a passion for the beautiful, and that it would not be safe to trust me with a moon that belonged to another person and that person didn't know I had it. I could give up a moon that I found in the daytime, because I should be afraid some one was looking; but if I found it in the dark, I am sure I should find some kind of an excuse for not saying anything about it. For I do love moons, they are so pretty and so romantic. I wish we had five or six; I would never go to bed; I should never get tired lying on the moss-bank and looking up at them.<br><br>    Stars are good, too. I wish I could get some to put in my hair. But I suppose I never can. You would be surprised to find how far off they are, for they do not look it. When they first showed, last night, I tried to knock some down with a pole, but it didn't reach, which astonished me; then I tried clouds till I was all tired out, but I never got one. It was because I am left-handed and cannot throw good. Even when I aimed at the one I wasn't after I couldn't hit the other one, though I did make some close shots, for I saw the black blot of the cloud sail right into the midst of the golden clusters forty or fifty times, just barely missing them, and if I could have held out a little longer maybe I could have got one.<br><br>    So I cried a little, which was natural, I suppose, for one of my age, and after I was rested I got a basket and started for a place on the extreme rim of the circle, where the stars were close to the ground and I could get them with my hands, which would be better, anyway, because I could gather them tenderly then, and not break them. But it was farther than I thought, and at last I had go give it up; I was so tired I couldn't drag my feet another step; and besides, they were sore and hurt me very much.<br><br>    I couldn't get back home; it was too far and turning cold; but I found some tigers and nestled in among them and was most adorably comfortable, and their breath was sweet and pleasant, because they live on strawberries. I had never seen a tiger before, but I knew them in a minute by the stripes. If I could have one of those skins, it would make a lovely gown.<br><br>    Today I am getting better ideas about distances. I was so eager to get hold of every pretty thing that I giddily grabbed for it, sometimes when it was too far off, and sometimes when it was but six inches away but seemed a foot--alas, with thorns between! I learned a lesson; also I made an axiom, all out of my own head --my very first one; <em><b><small>THE SCRATCHED EXPERIMENT SHUNS THE THORN</small></b></em>. I think it is a very good one for one so young.<br><br>    I followed the other Experiment around, yesterday afternoon, at a distance, to see what it might be for, if I could. But I was not able to make out. I think it is a man. I had never seen a man, but it looked like one, and I feel sure that that is what it is. I realize that I feel more curiosity about it than about any of the other reptiles. If it is a reptile, and I suppose it is; for it has frowzy hair and blue eyes, and looks like a reptile. It has no hips; it tapers like a carrot; when it stands, it spreads itself apart like a derrick; so I think it is a reptile, though it may be architecture.<br><br>    I was afraid of it at first, and started to run every time it turned around, for I thought it was going to chase me; but by and by I found it was only trying to get away, so after that I was not timid any more, but tracked it along, several hours, about twenty yards behind, which made it nervous and unhappy. At last it was a good deal worried, and climbed a tree. I waited a good while, then gave it up and went home.<br><br>    Today the same thing over. I've got it up the tree again.<br><br>    <b>SUNDAY</b>.--It is up there yet. Resting, apparently. But that is a subterfuge: Sunday isn't the day of rest; Saturday is appointed for that. It looks to me like a creature that is more interested in resting than it anything else. It would tire me to rest so much. It tires me just to sit around and watch the tree. I do wonder what it is for; I never see it do anything.<br><br>    They returned the moon last night, and I was SO happy! I think it is very honest of them. It slid down and fell off again, but I was not distressed; there is no need to worry when one has that kind of neighbors; they will fetch it back. I wish I could do something to show my appreciation. I would like to send them some stars, for we have more than we can use. I mean I, not we, for I can see that the reptile cares nothing for such things.<br><br>    It has low tastes, and is not kind. When I went there yesterday evening in the gloaming it had crept down and was trying to catch the little speckled fishes that play in the pool, and I had to clod it to make it go up the tree again and let them alone. I wonder if THAT is what it is for? Hasn't it any heart? Hasn't it any compassion for those little creature? Can it be that it was designed and manufactured for such ungentle work? It has the look of it. One of the clods took it back of the ear, and it used language. It gave me a thrill, for it was the first time I had ever heard speech, except my own. I did not understand the words, but they seemed expressive.<br><br>    When I found it could talk I felt a new interest in it, for I love to talk; I talk, all day, and in my sleep, too, and I am very interesting, but if I had another to talk to I could be twice as interesting, and would never stop, if desired.<br><br>    If this reptile is a man, it isn't an IT, is it? That wouldn't be grammatical, would it? I think it would be HE. I think so. In that case one would parse it thus: nominative, HE; dative, HIM; possessive, HIS'N. Well, I will consider it a man and call it he until it turns out to be something else. This will be handier than having so many uncertainties.<br><br>    <b>NEXT WEEK SUNDAY</b>.--All the week I tagged around after him and tried to get acquainted. I had to do the talking, because he was shy, but I didn't mind it. He seemed pleased to have me around, and I used the sociable ""we"" a good deal, because it seemed to flatter him to be included.<br><br>    <b>WEDNESDAY</b>.--We are getting along very well indeed, now, and getting better and better acquainted. He does not try to avoid me any more, which is a good sign, and shows that he likes to have me with him. That pleases me, and I study to be useful to him in every way I can, so as to increase his regard. During the last day or two I have taken all the work of naming things off his hands, and this has been a great relief to him, for he has no gift in that line, and is evidently very grateful. He can't think of a rational name to save him, but I do not let him see that I am aware of his defect. Whenever a new creature comes along I name it before he has time to expose himself by an awkward silence. In this way I have saved him many embarrassments. I have no defect like this. The minute I set eyes on an animal I know what it is. I don't have to reflect a moment; the right name comes out instantly, just as if it were an inspiration, as no doubt it is, for I am sure it wasn't in me half a minute before. I seem to know just by the shape of the creature and the way it acts what animal it is.<br><br>    When the dodo came along he thought it was a wildcat--I saw it in his eye. But I saved him. And I was careful not to do it in a way that could hurt his pride. I just spoke up in a quite natural way of pleasing surprise, and not as if I was dreaming of conveying information, and said, ""Well, I do declare, if there isn't the dodo!"" I explained--without seeming to be explaining --how I know it for a dodo, and although I thought maybe he was a little piqued that I knew the creature when he didn't, it was quite evident that he admired me. That was very agreeable, and I thought of it more than once with gratification before I slept. How little a thing can make us happy when we feel that we have earned it!<br><br>    <b>THURSDAY</b>.--my first sorrow. Yesterday he avoided me and seemed to wish I would not talk to him. I could not believe it, and thought there was some mistake, for I loved to be with him, and loved to hear him talk, and so how could it be that he could feel unkind toward me when I had not done anything? But at last it seemed true, so I went away and sat lonely in the place where I first saw him the morning that we were made and I did not know what he was and was indifferent about him; but now it was a mournful place, and every little thing spoke of him, and my heart was very sore. I did not know why very clearly, for it was a new feeling; I had not experienced it before, and it was all a mystery, and I could not make it out.<br><br>    But when night came I could not bear the lonesomeness, and went to the new shelter which he has built, to ask him what I had done that was wrong and how I could mend it and get back his kindness again; but he put me out in the rain, and it was my first sorrow.<br><br>    <b>SUNDAY</b>.--It is pleasant again, now, and I am happy; but those were heavy days; I do not think of them when I can help it.<br><br>    I tried to get him some of those apples, but I cannot learn to throw straight. I failed, but I think the good intention pleased him. They are forbidden, and he says I shall come to harm; but so I come to harm through pleasing him, why shall I care for that harm?<br><br>    <b>MONDAY</b>.--This morning I told him my name, hoping it would interest him. But he did not care for it. It is strange. If he should tell me his name, I would care. I think it would be pleasanter in my ears than any other sound.<br><br>    He talks very little. Perhaps it is because he is not bright, and is sensitive about it and wishes to conceal it. It is such a pity that he should feel so, for brightness is nothing; it is in the heart that the values lie. I wish I could make him understand that a loving good heart is riches, and riches enough, and that without it intellect is poverty.<br><br>    Although he talks so little, he has quite a considerable vocabulary. This morning he used a surprisingly good word. He evidently recognized, himself, that it was a good one, for he worked in in twice afterward, casually. It was good casual art, still it showed that he possesses a certain quality of perception. Without a doubt that seed can be made to grow, if cultivated.<br><br>    Where did he get that word? I do not think I have ever used it.<br><br>    No, he took no interest in my name. I tried to hide my disappointment, but I suppose I did not succeed. I went away and sat on the moss-bank with my feet in the water. It is where I go when I hunger for companionship, some one to look at, some one to talk to. It is not enough--that lovely white body painted there in the pool --but it is something, and something is better than utter loneliness. It talks when I talk; it is sad when I am sad; it comforts me with its sympathy; it says, ""Do not be downhearted, you poor friendless girl; I will be your friend."" It IS a good friend to me, and my only one; it is my sister.<br><br>    That first time that she forsook me! ah, I shall never forget that --never, never. My heart was lead in my body! I said, ""She was all I had, and now she is gone!"" In my despair I said, ""Break, my heart; I cannot bear my life any more!"" and hid my face in my hands, and there was no solace for me. And when I took them away, after a little, there she was again, white and shining and beautiful, and I sprang into her arms!<br><br>    That was perfect happiness; I had known happiness before, but it was not like this, which was ecstasy. I never doubted her afterward. Sometimes she stayed away--maybe an hour, maybe almost the whole day, but I waited and did not doubt; I said, ""She is busy, or she is gone on a journey, but she will come."" And it was so: she always did. At night she would not come if it was dark, for she was a timid little thing; but if there was a moon she would come. I am not afraid of the dark, but she is younger than I am; she was born after I was. Many and many are the visits I have paid her; she is my comfort and my refuge when my life is hard--and it is mainly that.<br><br>    <b>TUESDAY</b>.--All the morning I was at work improving the estate; and I purposely kept away from him in the hope that he would get lonely and come. But he did not.<br><br>    At noon I stopped for the day and took my recreation by flitting all about with the bees and the butterflies and reveling in the flowers, those beautiful creatures that catch the smile of God out of the sky and preserve it! I gathered them, and made them into wreaths and garlands and clothed myself in them while I ate my luncheon --apples, of course; then I sat in the shade and wished and waited. But he did not come.<br><br>    But no matter. Nothing would have come of it, for he does not care for flowers. He called them rubbish, and cannot tell one from another, and thinks it is superior to feel like that. He does not care for me, he does not care for flowers, he does not care for the painted sky at eventide--is there anything he does care for, except building shacks to coop himself up in from the good clean rain, and thumping the melons, and sampling the grapes, and fingering the fruit on the trees, to see how those properties are coming along?<br><br>    I laid a dry stick on the ground and tried to bore a hole in it with another one, in order to carry out a scheme that I had, and soon I got an awful fright. A thin, transparent bluish film rose out of the hole, and I dropped everything and ran! I thought it was a spirit, and I WAS so frightened! But I looked back, and it was not coming; so I leaned against a rock and rested and panted, and let my limps go on trembling until they got steady again; then I crept warily back, alert, watching, and ready to fly if there was occasion; and when I was come near, I parted the branches of a rose-bush and peeped through--wishing the man was about, I was looking so cunning and pretty--but the sprite was gone. I went there, and there was a pinch of delicate pink dust in the hole. I put my finger in, to feel it, and said OUCH! and took it out again. It was a cruel pain. I put my finger in my mouth; and by standing first on one foot and then the other, and grunting, I presently eased my misery; then I was full of interest, and began to examine.<br><br>    I was curious to know what the pink dust was. Suddenly the name of it occurred to me, though I had never heard of it before. It was FIRE! I was as certain of it as a person could be of anything in the world. So without hesitation I named it that--fire.<br><br>    I had created something that didn't exist before; I had added a new thing to the world's uncountable properties; I realized this, and was proud of my achievement, and was going to run and find him and tell him about it, thinking to raise myself in his esteem --but I reflected, and did not do it. No--he would not care for it. He would ask what it was good for, and what could I answer? for if it was not GOOD for something, but only beautiful, merely beautiful-- So I sighed, and did not go. For it wasn't good for anything; it could not build a shack, it could not improve melons, it could not hurry a fruit crop; it was useless, it was a foolishness and a vanity; he would despise it and say cutting words. But to me it was not despicable; I said, ""Oh, you fire, I love you, you dainty pink creature, for you are BEAUTIFUL--and that is enough!"" and was going to gather it to my breast. But refrained. Then I made another maxim out of my head, though it was so nearly like the first one that I was afraid it was only a plagiarism: <em><b><small>""THE BURNT EXPERIMENT SHUNS THE FIRE.""</small></b></em><br><br>    I wrought again; and when I had made a good deal of fire-dust I emptied it into a handful of dry brown grass, intending to carry it home and keep it always and play with it; but the wind struck it and it sprayed up and spat out at me fiercely, and I dropped it and ran. When I looked back the blue spirit was towering up and stretching and rolling away like a cloud, and instantly I thought of the name of it--SMOKE!--though, upon my word, I had never heard of smoke before.<br><br>    Soon brilliant yellow and red flares shot up through the smoke, and I named them in an instant--FLAMES--and I was right, too, though these were the very first flames that had ever been in the world. They climbed the trees, then flashed splendidly in and out of the vast and increasing volume of tumbling smoke, and I had to clap my hands and laugh and dance in my rapture, it was so new and strange and so wonderful and so beautiful!<br><br>    He came running, and stopped and gazed, and said not a word for many minutes. Then he asked what it was. Ah, it was too bad that he should ask such a direct question. I had to answer it, of course, and I did. I said it was fire. If it annoyed him that I should know and he must ask; that was not my fault; I had no desire to annoy him. After a pause he asked:<br><br>    ""How did it come?""<br><br>    Another direct question, and it also had to have a direct answer.<br><br>    ""I made it.""<br><br>    The fire was traveling farther and farther off. He went to the edge of the burned place and stood looking down, and said:<br><br>    ""What are these?""<br><br>    ""Fire-coals.""<br><br>    He picked up one to examine it, but changed his mind and put it down again. Then he went away. NOTHING interests him.<br><br>    But I was interested. There were ashes, gray and soft and delicate and pretty--I knew what they were at once. And the embers; I knew the embers, too. I found my apples, and raked them out, and was glad; for I am very young and my appetite is active. But I was disappointed; they were all burst open and spoiled. Spoiled apparently; but it was not so; they were better than raw ones. Fire is beautiful; some day it will be useful, I think.<br><br>    <b>FRIDAY</b>.--I saw him again, for a moment, last Monday at nightfall, but only for a moment. I was hoping he would praise me for trying to improve the estate, for I had meant well and had worked hard. But he was not pleased, and turned away and left me. He was also displeased on another account: I tried once more to persuade him to stop going over the Falls. That was because the fire had revealed to me a new passion--quite new, and distinctly different from love, grief, and those others which I had already discovered--FEAR. And it is horrible!--I wish I had never discovered it; it gives me dark moments, it spoils my happiness, it makes me shiver and tremble and shudder. But I could not persuade him, for he has not discovered fear yet, and so he could not understand me.<br><br>    <em><b><small>Extract from Adam's Diary</b><p>    Perhaps I ought to remember that she is very young, a mere girl and make allowances.

Like the other animals. They all do that.</small><br><br>    <b>FRIDAY</b>.--Tuesday--Wednesday--Thursday--and today: all without seeing him. It is a long time to be alone; still, it is better to be alone than unwelcome.<br><br>    I HAD to have company--I was made for it, I think--so I made friends with the animals. They are just charming, and they have the kindest disposition and the politest ways; they never look sour, they never let you feel that you are intruding, they smile at you and wag their tail, if they've got one, and they are always ready for a romp or an excursion or anything you want to propose. I think they are perfect gentlemen. All these days we have had such good times, and it hasn't been lonesome for me, ever. Lonesome! No, I should say not. Why, there's always a swarm of them around --sometimes as much as four or five acres--you can't count them; and when you stand on a rock in the midst and look out over the furry expanse it is so mottled and splashed and gay with color and frisking sheen and sun-flash, and so rippled with stripes, that you might think it was a lake, only you know it isn't; and there's storms of sociable birds, and hurricanes of whirring wings; and when the sun strikes all that feathery commotion, you have a blazing up of all the colors you can think of, enough to put your eyes out.<br><br>    We have made long excursions, and I have seen a great deal of the world; almost all of it, I think; and so I am the first traveler, and the only one. When we are on the march, it is an imposing sight --there's nothing like it anywhere. For comfort I ride a tiger or a leopard, because it is soft and has a round back that fits me, and because they are such pretty animals; but for long distance or for scenery I ride the elephant. He hoists me up with his trunk, but I can get off myself; when we are ready to camp, he sits and I slide down the back way.<br><br>    The birds and animals are all friendly to each other, and there are no disputes about anything. They all talk, and they all talk to me, but it must be a foreign language, for I cannot make out a word they say; yet they often understand me when I talk back, particularly the dog and the elephant. It makes me ashamed. It shows that they are brighter than I am, for I want to be the principal Experiment myself--and I intend to be, too.<br><br>    I have learned a number of things, and am educated, now, but I wasn't at first. I was ignorant at first. At first it used to vex me because, with all my watching, I was never smart enough to be around when the water was running uphill; but now I do not mind it. I have experimented and experimented until now I know it never does run uphill, except in the dark. I know it does in the dark, because the pool never goes dry, which it would, of course, if the water didn't come back in the night. It is best to prove things by actual experiment; then you KNOW; whereas if you depend on guessing and supposing and conjecturing, you never get educated.<br><br>    Some things you CAN'T find out; but you will never know you can't by guessing and supposing: no, you have to be patient and go on experimenting until you find out that you can't find out. And it is delightful to have it that way, it makes the world so interesting. If there wasn't anything to find out, it would be dull. Even trying to find out and not finding out is just as interesting as trying to find out and finding out, and I don't know but more so. The secret of the water was a treasure until I GOT it; then the excitement all went away, and I recognized a sense of loss.<br><br>    By experiment I know that wood swims, and dry leaves, and feathers, and plenty of other things; therefore by all that cumulative evidence you know that a rock will swim; but you have to put up with simply knowing it, for there isn't any way to prove it--up to now. But I shall find a way--then THAT excitement will go. Such things make me sad; because by and by when I have found out everything there won't be any more excitements, and I do love excitements so! The other night I couldn't sleep for thinking about it.<br><br>    At first I couldn't make out what I was made for, but now I think it was to search out the secrets of this wonderful world and be happy and thank the Giver of it all for devising it. I think there are many things to learn yet--I hope so; and by economizing and not hurrying too fast I think they will last weeks and weeks. I hope so. When you cast up a feather it sails away on the air and goes out of sight; then you throw up a clod and it doesn't. It comes down, every time. I have tried it and tried it, and it is always so. I wonder why it is? Of course it DOESN'T come down, but why should it SEEM to? I suppose it is an optical illusion. I mean, one of them is. I don't know which one. It may be the feather, it may be the clod; I can't prove which it is, I can only demonstrate that one or the other is a fake, and let a person take his choice.<br><br>    By watching, I know that the stars are not going to last. I have seen some of the best ones melt and run down the sky. Since one can melt, they can all melt; since they can all melt, they can all melt the same night. That sorrow will come--I know it. I mean to sit up every night and look at them as long as I can keep awake; and I will impress those sparkling fields on my memory, so that by and by when they are taken away I can by my fancy restore those lovely myriads to the black sky and make them sparkle again, and double them by the blur of my tears.<br><br>    <b>After the Fall</b><br><br>    When I look back, the Garden is a dream to me. It was beautiful, surpassingly beautiful, enchantingly beautiful; and now it is lost, and I shall not see it any more.<br><br>    The Garden is lost, but I have found HIM, and am content. He loves me as well as he can; I love him with all the strength of my passionate nature, and this, I think, is proper to my youth and sex. If I ask myself why I love him, I find I do not know, and do not really much care to know; so I suppose that this kind of love is not a product of reasoning and statistics, like one's love for other reptiles and animals. I think that this must be so. I love certain birds because of their song; but I do not love Adam on account of his singing--no, it is not that; the more he sings the more I do not get reconciled to it. Yet I ask him to sing, because I wish to learn to like everything he is interested in. I am sure I can learn, because at first I could not stand it, but now I can. It sours the milk, but it doesn't matter; I can get used to that kind of milk.<br><br>    It is not on account of his brightness that I love him--no, it is not that. He is not to blame for his brightness, such as it is, for he did not make it himself; he is as God make him, and that is sufficient. There was a wise purpose in it, THAT I know. In time it will develop, though I think it will not be sudden; and besides, there is no hurry; he is well enough just as he is.<br><br>    It is not on account of his gracious and considerate ways and his delicacy that I love him. No, he has lacks in this regard, but he is well enough just so, and is improving.<br><br>    It is not on account of his industry that I love him--no, it is not that. I think he has it in him, and I do not know why he conceals it from me. It is my only pain. Otherwise he is frank and open with me, now. I am sure he keeps nothing from me but this. It grieves me that he should have a secret from me, and sometimes it spoils my sleep, thinking of it, but I will put it out of my mind; it shall not trouble my happiness, which is otherwise full to overflowing.<br><br>    It is not on account of his education that I love him--no, it is not that. He is self-educated, and does really know a multitude of things, but they are not so.<br><br>    It is not on account of his chivalry that I love him--no, it is not that. He told on me, but I do not blame him; it is a peculiarity of sex, I think, and he did not make his sex. Of course I would not have told on him, I would have perished first; but that is a peculiarity of sex, too, and I do not take credit for it, for I did not make my sex.<br><br>    Then why is it that I love him? MERELY BECAUSE HE IS MASCULINE, I think.<br><br>    At bottom he is good, and I love him for that, but I could love him without it. If he should beat me and abuse me, I should go on loving him. I know it. It is a matter of sex, I think.<br><br>    He is strong and handsome, and I love him for that, and I admire him and am proud of him, but I could love him without those qualities. He he were plain, I should love him; if he were a wreck, I should love him; and I would work for him, and slave over him, and pray for him, and watch by his bedside until I died.<br><br>    Yes, I think I love him merely because he is MINE and is MASCULINE. There is no other reason, I suppose. And so I think it is as I first said: that this kind of love is not a product of reasonings and statistics. It just COMES--none knows whence--and cannot explain itself. And doesn't need to.<br><br>    It is what I think. But I am only a girl, the first that has examined this matter, and it may turn out that in my ignorance and inexperience I have not got it right.<br><br>    <b>Forty Years Later</b><br><br>    It is my prayer, it is my longing, that we may pass from this life together--a longing which shall never perish from the earth, but shall have place in the heart of every wife that loves, until the end of time; and it shall be called by my name.<br><br>    But if one of us must go first, it is my prayer that it shall be I; for he is strong, I am weak, I am not so necessary to him as he is to me--life without him would not be life; now could I endure it? This prayer is also immortal, and will not cease from being offered up while my race continues. I am the first wife; and in the last wife I shall be repeated.<br><br>    <b>At Eve's Grave</b><br><br>    ADAM: Wheresoever she was, THERE was Eden.  <br><br>"
7,The Story Of An Hour - By Kate Chopin,"Knowing that Mrs. Mallard was afflicted with a heart trouble, great care was taken to break to her as gently as possible the news of her husband's death.<br><br>    It was her sister Josephine who told her, in broken sentences; veiled hints that revealed in half concealing. Her husband's friend Richards was there, too, near her. It was he who had been in the newspaper office when intelligence of the railroad disaster was received, with Brently Mallard's name leading the list of ""killed."" He had only taken the time to assure himself of its truth by a second telegram, and had hastened to forestall any less careful, less tender friend in bearing the sad message.<br><br>    She did not hear the story as many women have heard the same, with a paralyzed inability to accept its significance. She wept at once, with sudden, wild abandonment, in her sister's arms. When the storm of grief had spent itself she went away to her room alone. She would have no one follow her.<br><br>    There stood, facing the open window, a comfortable, roomy armchair. Into this she sank, pressed down by a physical exhaustion that haunted her body and seemed to reach into her soul.<br><br>    She could see in the open square before her house the tops of trees that were all aquiver with the new spring life. The delicious breath of rain was in the air. In the street below a peddler was crying his wares. The notes of a distant song which someone was singing reached her faintly, and countless sparrows were twittering in the eaves.<br><br>    There were patches of blue sky showing here and there through the clouds that had met and piled one above the other in the west facing her window.<br><br>    She sat with her head thrown back upon the cushion of the chair, quite motionless, except when a sob came up into her throat and shook her, as a child who has cried itself to sleep continues to sob in its dreams.<br><br>    She was young, with a fair, calm face, whose lines bespoke repression and even a certain strength. But now there was a dull stare in her eyes, whose gaze was fixed away off yonder on one of those patches of blue sky. It was not a glance of reflection, but rather indicated a suspension of intelligent thought.<br><br>    There was something coming to her and she was waiting for it, fearfully. What was it? She did not know; it was too subtle and elusive to name. But she felt it, creeping out of the sky, reaching toward her through the sounds, the scents, the color that filled the air.<br><br>    Now her bosom rose and fell tumultuously. She was beginning to recognize this thing that was approaching to possess her, and she was striving to beat it back with her will--as powerless as her two white slender hands would have been. When she abandoned herself a little whispered word escaped her slightly parted lips. She said it over and over under the breath: ""free, free, free!"" The vacant stare and the look of terror that had followed it went from her eyes. They stayed keen and bright. Her pulses beat fast, and the coursing blood warmed and relaxed every inch of her body.<br><br>    She did not stop to ask if it were or were not a monstrous joy that held her. A clear and exalted perception enabled her to dismiss the suggestion as trivial. She knew that she would weep again when she saw the kind, tender hands folded in death; the face that had never looked save with love upon her, fixed and gray and dead. But she saw beyond that bitter moment a long procession of years to come that would belong to her absolutely. And she opened and spread her arms out to them in welcome.<br><br>    There would be no one to live for during those coming years; she would live for herself. There would be no powerful will bending hers in that blind persistence with which men and women believe they have a right to impose a private will upon a fellow-creature. A kind intention or a cruel intention made the act seem no less a crime as she looked upon it in that brief moment of illumination.<br><br>    And yet she had loved him--sometimes. Often she had not. What did it matter! What could love, the unsolved mystery, count for in the face of this possession of self-assertion which she suddenly recognized as the strongest impulse of her being!<br><br>    ""Free! Body and soul free!"" she kept whispering.<br><br>    Josephine was kneeling before the closed door with her lips to the keyhole, imploring for admission. ""Louise, open the door! I beg; open the door--you will make yourself ill. What are you doing, Louise? For heaven's sake open the door.""<br><br>    ""Go away. I am not making myself ill."" No; she was drinking in a very elixir of life through that open window.<br><br>    Her fancy was running riot along those days ahead of her. Spring days, and summer days, and all sorts of days that would be her own. She breathed a quick prayer that life might be long. It was only yesterday she had thought with a shudder that life might be long.<br><br>    She arose at length and opened the door to her sister's importunities. There was a feverish triumph in her eyes, and she carried herself unwittingly like a goddess of Victory. She clasped her sister's waist, and together they descended the stairs. Richards stood waiting for them at the bottom.<br><br>    Someone was opening the front door with a latchkey. It was Brently Mallard who entered, a little travel-stained, composedly carrying his grip-sack and umbrella. He had been far from the scene of the accident, and did not even know there had been one. He stood amazed at Josephine's piercing cry; at Richards' quick motion to screen him from the view of his wife.<br><br>    When the doctors came they said she had died of heart disease--of the joy that kills.                                <br><br>"
8,To Build A Fire - By Jack London,"Day had broken cold and grey, exceedingly cold and grey, when the man turned aside from the main Yukon trail and climbed the high earth- bank, where a dim and little-travelled trail led eastward through the fat spruce timberland. It was a steep bank, and he paused for breath at the top, excusing the act to himself by looking at his watch. It was nine o'clock. There was no sun nor hint of sun, though there was not a cloud in the sky. It was a clear day, and yet there seemed an intangible pall over the face of things, a subtle gloom that made the day dark, and that was due to the absence of sun. This fact did not worry the man. He was used to the lack of sun. It had been days since he had seen the sun, and he knew that a few more days must pass before that cheerful orb, due south, would just peep above the sky- line and dip immediately from view.  <br><br>  The man flung a look back along the way he had come. The Yukon lay a mile wide and hidden under three feet of ice. On top of this ice were as many feet of snow. It was all pure white, rolling in gentle undulations where the ice-jams of the freeze-up had formed. North and south, as far as his eye could see, it was unbroken white, save for a dark hair-line that curved and twisted from around the spruce- covered island to the south, and that curved and twisted away into the north, where it disappeared behind another spruce-covered island. This dark hair-line was the trail--the main trail--that led south five hundred miles to the Chilcoot Pass, Dyea, and salt water; and that led north seventy miles to Dawson, and still on to the north a thousand miles to Nulato, and finally to St. Michael on Bering Sea, a thousand miles and half a thousand more.  <br><br>  But all this--the mysterious, far-reaching hairline trail, the absence of sun from the sky, the tremendous cold, and the strangeness and weirdness of it all--made no impression on the man. It was not because he was long used to it. He was a new-comer in the land, a chechaquo, and this was his first winter. The trouble with him was that he was without imagination. He was quick and alert in the things of life, but only in the things, and not in the significances. Fifty degrees below zero meant eighty odd degrees of frost. Such fact impressed him as being cold and uncomfortable, and that was all. It did not lead him to meditate upon his frailty as a creature of temperature, and upon man's frailty in general, able only to live within certain narrow limits of heat and cold; and from there on it did not lead him to the conjectural field of immortality and man's place in the universe. Fifty degrees below zero stood for a bite of frost that hurt and that must be guarded against by the use of mittens, ear-flaps, warm moccasins, and thick socks. Fifty degrees below zero was to him just precisely fifty degrees below zero. That there should be anything more to it than that was a thought that never entered his head.  <br><br>  As he turned to go on, he spat speculatively. There was a sharp, explosive crackle that startled him. He spat again. And again, in the air, before it could fall to the snow, the spittle crackled. He knew that at fifty below spittle crackled on the snow, but this spittle had crackled in the air. Undoubtedly it was colder than fifty below--how much colder he did not know. But the temperature did not matter. He was bound for the old claim on the left fork of Henderson Creek, where the boys were already. They had come over across the divide from the Indian Creek country, while he had come the roundabout way to take a look at the possibilities of getting out logs in the spring from the islands in the Yukon. He would be in to camp by six o'clock; a bit after dark, it was true, but the boys would be there, a fire would be going, and a hot supper would be ready. As for lunch, he pressed his hand against the protruding bundle under his jacket. It was also under his shirt, wrapped up in a handkerchief and lying against the naked skin. It was the only way to keep the biscuits from freezing. He smiled agreeably to himself as he thought of those biscuits, each cut open and sopped in bacon grease, and each enclosing a generous slice of fried bacon.  <br><br>  He plunged in among the big spruce trees. The trail was faint. A foot of snow had fallen since the last sled had passed over, and he was glad he was without a sled, travelling light. In fact, he carried nothing but the lunch wrapped in the handkerchief. He was surprised, however, at the cold. It certainly was cold, he concluded, as he rubbed his numbed nose and cheek-bones with his mittened hand. He was a warm-whiskered man, but the hair on his face did not protect the high cheek-bones and the eager nose that thrust itself aggressively into the frosty air.  <br><br>  At the man's heels trotted a dog, a big native husky, the proper wolf-dog, grey-coated and without any visible or temperamental difference from its brother, the wild wolf. The animal was depressed by the tremendous cold. It knew that it was no time for travelling. Its instinct told it a truer tale than was told to the man by the man's judgment. In reality, it was not merely colder than fifty below zero; it was colder than sixty below, than seventy below. It was seventy-five below zero. Since the freezing-point is thirty-two above zero, it meant that one hundred and seven degrees of frost obtained. The dog did not know anything about thermometers. Possibly in its brain there was no sharp consciousness of a condition of very cold such as was in the man's brain. But the brute had its instinct. It experienced a vague but menacing apprehension that subdued it and made it slink along at the man's heels, and that made it question eagerly every unwonted movement of the man as if expecting him to go into camp or to seek shelter somewhere and build a fire. The dog had learned fire, and it wanted fire, or else to burrow under the snow and cuddle its warmth away from the air.  <br><br>  The frozen moisture of its breathing had settled on its fur in a fine powder of frost, and especially were its jowls, muzzle, and eyelashes whitened by its crystalled breath. The man's red beard and moustache were likewise frosted, but more solidly, the deposit taking the form of ice and increasing with every warm, moist breath he exhaled. Also, the man was chewing tobacco, and the muzzle of ice held his lips so rigidly that he was unable to clear his chin when he expelled the juice. The result was that a crystal beard of the colour and solidity of amber was increasing its length on his chin. If he fell down it would shatter itself, like glass, into brittle fragments. But he did not mind the appendage. It was the penalty all tobacco- chewers paid in that country, and he had been out before in two cold snaps. They had not been so cold as this, he knew, but by the spirit thermometer at Sixty Mile he knew they had been registered at fifty below and at fifty-five.  <br><br>  He held on through the level stretch of woods for several miles, crossed a wide flat of nigger-heads, and dropped down a bank to the frozen bed of a small stream. This was Henderson Creek, and he knew he was ten miles from the forks. He looked at his watch. It was ten o'clock. He was making four miles an hour, and he calculated that he would arrive at the forks at half-past twelve. He decided to celebrate that event by eating his lunch there.  <br><br>  The dog dropped in again at his heels, with a tail drooping discouragement, as the man swung along the creek-bed. The furrow of the old sled-trail was plainly visible, but a dozen inches of snow covered the marks of the last runners. In a month no man had come up or down that silent creek. The man held steadily on. He was not much given to thinking, and just then particularly he had nothing to think about save that he would eat lunch at the forks and that at six o'clock he would be in camp with the boys. There was nobody to talk to and, had there been, speech would have been impossible because of the ice-muzzle on his mouth. So he continued monotonously to chew tobacco and to increase the length of his amber beard.  <br><br>  Once in a while the thought reiterated itself that it was very cold and that he had never experienced such cold. As he walked along he rubbed his cheek-bones and nose with the back of his mittened hand. He did this automatically, now and again changing hands. But rub as he would, the instant he stopped his cheek-bones went numb, and the following instant the end of his nose went numb. He was sure to frost his cheeks; he knew that, and experienced a pang of regret that he had not devised a nose-strap of the sort Bud wore in cold snaps. Such a strap passed across the cheeks, as well, and saved them. But it didn't matter much, after all. What were frosted cheeks? A bit painful, that was all; they were never serious.  <br><br>  Empty as the man's mind was of thoughts, he was keenly observant, and he noticed the changes in the creek, the curves and bends and timber- jams, and always he sharply noted where he placed his feet. Once, coming around a bend, he shied abruptly, like a startled horse, curved away from the place where he had been walking, and retreated several paces back along the trail. The creek he knew was frozen clear to the bottom--no creek could contain water in that arctic winter--but he knew also that there were springs that bubbled out from the hillsides and ran along under the snow and on top the ice of the creek. He knew that the coldest snaps never froze these springs, and he knew likewise their danger. They were traps. They hid pools of water under the snow that might be three inches deep, or three feet. Sometimes a skin of ice half an inch thick covered them, and in turn was covered by the snow. Sometimes there were alternate layers of water and ice-skin, so that when one broke through he kept on breaking through for a while, sometimes wetting himself to the waist.  <br><br>  That was why he had shied in such panic. He had felt the give under his feet and heard the crackle of a snow-hidden ice-skin. And to get his feet wet in such a temperature meant trouble and danger. At the very least it meant delay, for he would be forced to stop and build a fire, and under its protection to bare his feet while he dried his socks and moccasins. He stood and studied the creek-bed and its banks, and decided that the flow of water came from the right. He reflected awhile, rubbing his nose and cheeks, then skirted to the left, stepping gingerly and testing the footing for each step. Once clear of the danger, he took a fresh chew of tobacco and swung along at his four-mile gait.  <br><br>  In the course of the next two hours he came upon several similar traps. Usually the snow above the hidden pools had a sunken, candied appearance that advertised the danger. Once again, however, he had a close call; and once, suspecting danger, he compelled the dog to go on in front. The dog did not want to go. It hung back until the man shoved it forward, and then it went quickly across the white, unbroken surface. Suddenly it broke through, floundered to one side, and got away to firmer footing. It had wet its forefeet and legs, and almost immediately the water that clung to it turned to ice. It made quick efforts to lick the ice off its legs, then dropped down in the snow and began to bite out the ice that had formed between the toes. This was a matter of instinct. To permit the ice to remain would mean sore feet. It did not know this. It merely obeyed the mysterious prompting that arose from the deep crypts of its being. But the man knew, having achieved a judgment on the subject, and he removed the mitten from his right hand and helped tear out the ice- particles. He did not expose his fingers more than a minute, and was astonished at the swift numbness that smote them. It certainly was cold. He pulled on the mitten hastily, and beat the hand savagely across his chest.  <br><br>  At twelve o'clock the day was at its brightest. Yet the sun was too far south on its winter journey to clear the horizon. The bulge of the earth intervened between it and Henderson Creek, where the man walked under a clear sky at noon and cast no shadow. At half-past twelve, to the minute, he arrived at the forks of the creek. He was pleased at the speed he had made. If he kept it up, he would certainly be with the boys by six. He unbuttoned his jacket and shirt and drew forth his lunch. The action consumed no more than a quarter of a minute, yet in that brief moment the numbness laid hold of the exposed fingers. He did not put the mitten on, but, instead, struck the fingers a dozen sharp smashes against his leg. Then he sat down on a snow-covered log to eat. The sting that followed upon the striking of his fingers against his leg ceased so quickly that he was startled, he had had no chance to take a bite of biscuit. He struck the fingers repeatedly and returned them to the mitten, baring the other hand for the purpose of eating. He tried to take a mouthful, but the ice-muzzle prevented. He had forgotten to build a fire and thaw out. He chuckled at his foolishness, and as he chuckled he noted the numbness creeping into the exposed fingers. Also, he noted that the stinging which had first come to his toes when he sat down was already passing away. He wondered whether the toes were warm or numbed. He moved them inside the moccasins and decided that they were numbed.  <br><br>  He pulled the mitten on hurriedly and stood up. He was a bit frightened. He stamped up and down until the stinging returned into the feet. It certainly was cold, was his thought. That man from Sulphur Creek had spoken the truth when telling how cold it sometimes got in the country. And he had laughed at him at the time! That showed one must not be too sure of things. There was no mistake about it, it was cold. He strode up and down, stamping his feet and threshing his arms, until reassured by the returning warmth. Then he got out matches and proceeded to make a fire. From the undergrowth, where high water of the previous spring had lodged a supply of seasoned twigs, he got his firewood. Working carefully from a small beginning, he soon had a roaring fire, over which he thawed the ice from his face and in the protection of which he ate his biscuits. For the moment the cold of space was outwitted. The dog took satisfaction in the fire, stretching out close enough for warmth and far enough away to escape being singed.  <br><br>  When the man had finished, he filled his pipe and took his comfortable time over a smoke. Then he pulled on his mittens, settled the ear-flaps of his cap firmly about his ears, and took the creek trail up the left fork. The dog was disappointed and yearned back toward the fire. This man did not know cold. Possibly all the generations of his ancestry had been ignorant of cold, of real cold, of cold one hundred and seven degrees below freezing-point. But the dog knew; all its ancestry knew, and it had inherited the knowledge. And it knew that it was not good to walk abroad in such fearful cold. It was the time to lie snug in a hole in the snow and wait for a curtain of cloud to be drawn across the face of outer space whence this cold came. On the other hand, there was keen intimacy between the dog and the man. The one was the toil-slave of the other, and the only caresses it had ever received were the caresses of the whip- lash and of harsh and menacing throat-sounds that threatened the whip-lash. So the dog made no effort to communicate its apprehension to the man. It was not concerned in the welfare of the man; it was for its own sake that it yearned back toward the fire. But the man whistled, and spoke to it with the sound of whip-lashes, and the dog swung in at the man's heels and followed after.  <br><br>  The man took a chew of tobacco and proceeded to start a new amber beard. Also, his moist breath quickly powdered with white his moustache, eyebrows, and lashes. There did not seem to be so many springs on the left fork of the Henderson, and for half an hour the man saw no signs of any. And then it happened. At a place where there were no signs, where the soft, unbroken snow seemed to advertise solidity beneath, the man broke through. It was not deep. He wetted himself half-way to the knees before he floundered out to the firm crust.  <br><br>  He was angry, and cursed his luck aloud. He had hoped to get into camp with the boys at six o'clock, and this would delay him an hour, for he would have to build a fire and dry out his foot-gear. This was imperative at that low temperature--he knew that much; and he turned aside to the bank, which he climbed. On top, tangled in the underbrush about the trunks of several small spruce trees, was a high-water deposit of dry firewood--sticks and twigs principally, but also larger portions of seasoned branches and fine, dry, last-year's grasses. He threw down several large pieces on top of the snow. This served for a foundation and prevented the young flame from drowning itself in the snow it otherwise would melt. The flame he got by touching a match to a small shred of birch-bark that he took from his pocket. This burned even more readily than paper. Placing it on the foundation, he fed the young flame with wisps of dry grass and with the tiniest dry twigs.  <br><br>  He worked slowly and carefully, keenly aware of his danger. Gradually, as the flame grew stronger, he increased the size of the twigs with which he fed it. He squatted in the snow, pulling the twigs out from their entanglement in the brush and feeding directly to the flame. He knew there must be no failure. When it is seventy- five below zero, a man must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire--that is, if his feet are wet. If his feet are dry, and he fails, he can run along the trail for half a mile and restore his circulation. But the circulation of wet and freezing feet cannot be restored by running when it is seventy-five below. No matter how fast he runs, the wet feet will freeze the harder.  <br><br>  All this the man knew. The old-timer on Sulphur Creek had told him about it the previous fall, and now he was appreciating the advice. Already all sensation had gone out of his feet. To build the fire he had been forced to remove his mittens, and the fingers had quickly gone numb. His pace of four miles an hour had kept his heart pumping blood to the surface of his body and to all the extremities. But the instant he stopped, the action of the pump eased down. The cold of space smote the unprotected tip of the planet, and he, being on that unprotected tip, received the full force of the blow. The blood of his body recoiled before it. The blood was alive, like the dog, and like the dog it wanted to hide away and cover itself up from the fearful cold. So long as he walked four miles an hour, he pumped that blood, willy-nilly, to the surface; but now it ebbed away and sank down into the recesses of his body. The extremities were the first to feel its absence. His wet feet froze the faster, and his exposed fingers numbed the faster, though they had not yet begun to freeze. Nose and cheeks were already freezing, while the skin of all his body chilled as it lost its blood.  <br><br>  But he was safe. Toes and nose and cheeks would be only touched by the frost, for the fire was beginning to burn with strength. He was feeding it with twigs the size of his finger. In another minute he would be able to feed it with branches the size of his wrist, and then he could remove his wet foot-gear, and, while it dried, he could keep his naked feet warm by the fire, rubbing them at first, of course, with snow. The fire was a success. He was safe. He remembered the advice of the old-timer on Sulphur Creek, and smiled. The old-timer had been very serious in laying down the law that no man must travel alone in the Klondike after fifty below. Well, here he was; he had had the accident; he was alone; and he had saved himself. Those old-timers were rather womanish, some of them, he thought. All a man had to do was to keep his head, and he was all right. Any man who was a man could travel alone. But it was surprising, the rapidity with which his cheeks and nose were freezing. And he had not thought his fingers could go lifeless in so short a time. Lifeless they were, for he could scarcely make them move together to grip a twig, and they seemed remote from his body and from him. When he touched a twig, he had to look and see whether or not he had hold of it. The wires were pretty well down between him and his finger-ends.  <br><br>  All of which counted for little. There was the fire, snapping and crackling and promising life with every dancing flame. He started to untie his moccasins. They were coated with ice; the thick German socks were like sheaths of iron half-way to the knees; and the mocassin strings were like rods of steel all twisted and knotted as by some conflagration. For a moment he tugged with his numbed fingers, then, realizing the folly of it, he drew his sheath-knife.  <br><br>  But before he could cut the strings, it happened. It was his own fault or, rather, his mistake. He should not have built the fire under the spruce tree. He should have built it in the open. But it had been easier to pull the twigs from the brush and drop them directly on the fire. Now the tree under which he had done this carried a weight of snow on its boughs. No wind had blown for weeks, and each bough was fully freighted. Each time he had pulled a twig he had communicated a slight agitation to the tree--an imperceptible agitation, so far as he was concerned, but an agitation sufficient to bring about the disaster. High up in the tree one bough capsized its load of snow. This fell on the boughs beneath, capsizing them. This process continued, spreading out and involving the whole tree. It grew like an avalanche, and it descended without warning upon the man and the fire, and the fire was blotted out! Where it had burned was a mantle of fresh and disordered snow.  <br><br>  The man was shocked. It was as though he had just heard his own sentence of death. For a moment he sat and stared at the spot where the fire had been. Then he grew very calm. Perhaps the old-timer on Sulphur Creek was right. If he had only had a trail-mate he would have been in no danger now. The trail-mate could have built the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire over again, and this second time there must be no failure. Even if he succeeded, he would most likely lose some toes. His feet must be badly frozen by now, and there would be some time before the second fire was ready.  <br><br>  Such were his thoughts, but he did not sit and think them. He was busy all the time they were passing through his mind, he made a new foundation for a fire, this time in the open; where no treacherous tree could blot it out. Next, he gathered dry grasses and tiny twigs from the high-water flotsam. He could not bring his fingers together to pull them out, but he was able to gather them by the handful. In this way he got many rotten twigs and bits of green moss that were undesirable, but it was the best he could do. He worked methodically, even collecting an armful of the larger branches to be used later when the fire gathered strength. And all the while the dog sat and watched him, a certain yearning wistfulness in its eyes, for it looked upon him as the fire-provider, and the fire was slow in coming.  <br><br>  When all was ready, the man reached in his pocket for a second piece of birch-bark. He knew the bark was there, and, though he could not feel it with his fingers, he could hear its crisp rustling as he fumbled for it. Try as he would, he could not clutch hold of it. And all the time, in his consciousness, was the knowledge that each instant his feet were freezing. This thought tended to put him in a panic, but he fought against it and kept calm. He pulled on his mittens with his teeth, and threshed his arms back and forth, beating his hands with all his might against his sides. He did this sitting down, and he stood up to do it; and all the while the dog sat in the snow, its wolf-brush of a tail curled around warmly over its forefeet, its sharp wolf-ears pricked forward intently as it watched the man. And the man as he beat and threshed with his arms and hands, felt a great surge of envy as he regarded the creature that was warm and secure in its natural covering.  <br><br>  After a time he was aware of the first far-away signals of sensation in his beaten fingers. The faint tingling grew stronger till it evolved into a stinging ache that was excruciating, but which the man hailed with satisfaction. He stripped the mitten from his right hand and fetched forth the birch-bark. The exposed fingers were quickly going numb again. Next he brought out his bunch of sulphur matches. But the tremendous cold had already driven the life out of his fingers. In his effort to separate one match from the others, the whole bunch fell in the snow. He tried to pick it out of the snow, but failed. The dead fingers could neither touch nor clutch. He was very careful. He drove the thought of his freezing feet; and nose, and cheeks, out of his mind, devoting his whole soul to the matches. He watched, using the sense of vision in place of that of touch, and when he saw his fingers on each side the bunch, he closed them--that is, he willed to close them, for the wires were drawn, and the fingers did not obey. He pulled the mitten on the right hand, and beat it fiercely against his knee. Then, with both mittened hands, he scooped the bunch of matches, along with much snow, into his lap. Yet he was no better off.  <br><br>  After some manipulation he managed to get the bunch between the heels of his mittened hands. In this fashion he carried it to his mouth. The ice crackled and snapped when by a violent effort he opened his mouth. He drew the lower jaw in, curled the upper lip out of the way, and scraped the bunch with his upper teeth in order to separate a match. He succeeded in getting one, which he dropped on his lap. He was no better off. He could not pick it up. Then he devised a way. He picked it up in his teeth and scratched it on his leg. Twenty times he scratched before he succeeded in lighting it. As it flamed he held it with his teeth to the birch-bark. But the burning brimstone went up his nostrils and into his lungs, causing him to cough spasmodically. The match fell into the snow and went out.  <br><br>  The old-timer on Sulphur Creek was right, he thought in the moment of controlled despair that ensued: after fifty below, a man should travel with a partner. He beat his hands, but failed in exciting any sensation. Suddenly he bared both hands, removing the mittens with his teeth. He caught the whole bunch between the heels of his hands. His arm-muscles not being frozen enabled him to press the hand-heels tightly against the matches. Then he scratched the bunch along his leg. It flared into flame, seventy sulphur matches at once! There was no wind to blow them out. He kept his head to one side to escape the strangling fumes, and held the blazing bunch to the birch-bark. As he so held it, he became aware of sensation in his hand. His flesh was burning. He could smell it. Deep down below the surface he could feel it. The sensation developed into pain that grew acute. And still he endured it, holding the flame of the matches clumsily to the bark that would not light readily because his own burning hands were in the way, absorbing most of the flame.  <br><br>  At last, when he could endure no more, he jerked his hands apart. The blazing matches fell sizzling into the snow, but the birch-bark was alight. He began laying dry grasses and the tiniest twigs on the flame. He could not pick and choose, for he had to lift the fuel between the heels of his hands. Small pieces of rotten wood and green moss clung to the twigs, and he bit them off as well as he could with his teeth. He cherished the flame carefully and awkwardly. It meant life, and it must not perish. The withdrawal of blood from the surface of his body now made him begin to shiver, and he grew more awkward. A large piece of green moss fell squarely on the little fire. He tried to poke it out with his fingers, but his shivering frame made him poke too far, and he disrupted the nucleus of the little fire, the burning grasses and tiny twigs separating and scattering. He tried to poke them together again, but in spite of the tenseness of the effort, his shivering got away with him, and the twigs were hopelessly scattered. Each twig gushed a puff of smoke and went out. The fire-provider had failed. As he looked apathetically about him, his eyes chanced on the dog, sitting across the ruins of the fire from him, in the snow, making restless, hunching movements, slightly lifting one forefoot and then the other, shifting its weight back and forth on them with wistful eagerness.  <br><br>  The sight of the dog put a wild idea into his head. He remembered the tale of the man, caught in a blizzard, who killed a steer and crawled inside the carcass, and so was saved. He would kill the dog and bury his hands in the warm body until the numbness went out of them. Then he could build another fire. He spoke to the dog, calling it to him; but in his voice was a strange note of fear that frightened the animal, who had never known the man to speak in such way before. Something was the matter, and its suspicious nature sensed danger,--it knew not what danger but somewhere, somehow, in its brain arose an apprehension of the man. It flattened its ears down at the sound of the man's voice, and its restless, hunching movements and the liftings and shiftings of its forefeet became more pronounced but it would not come to the man. He got on his hands and knees and crawled toward the dog. This unusual posture again excited suspicion, and the animal sidled mincingly away.  <br><br>  The man sat up in the snow for a moment and struggled for calmness. Then he pulled on his mittens, by means of his teeth, and got upon his feet. He glanced down at first in order to assure himself that he was really standing up, for the absence of sensation in his feet left him unrelated to the earth. His erect position in itself started to drive the webs of suspicion from the dog's mind; and when he spoke peremptorily, with the sound of whip-lashes in his voice, the dog rendered its customary allegiance and came to him. As it came within reaching distance, the man lost his control. His arms flashed out to the dog, and he experienced genuine surprise when he discovered that his hands could not clutch, that there was neither bend nor feeling in the lingers. He had forgotten for the moment that they were frozen and that they were freezing more and more. All this happened quickly, and before the animal could get away, he encircled its body with his arms. He sat down in the snow, and in this fashion held the dog, while it snarled and whined and struggled.  <br><br>  But it was all he could do, hold its body encircled in his arms and sit there. He realized that he could not kill the dog. There was no way to do it. With his helpless hands he could neither draw nor hold his sheath-knife nor throttle the animal. He released it, and it plunged wildly away, with tail between its legs, and still snarling. It halted forty feet away and surveyed him curiously, with ears sharply pricked forward. The man looked down at his hands in order to locate them, and found them hanging on the ends of his arms. It struck him as curious that one should have to use his eyes in order to find out where his hands were. He began threshing his arms back and forth, beating the mittened hands against his sides. He did this for five minutes, violently, and his heart pumped enough blood up to the surface to put a stop to his shivering. But no sensation was aroused in the hands. He had an impression that they hung like weights on the ends of his arms, but when he tried to run the impression down, he could not find it.  <br><br>  A certain fear of death, dull and oppressive, came to him. This fear quickly became poignant as he realized that it was no longer a mere matter of freezing his fingers and toes, or of losing his hands and feet, but that it was a matter of life and death with the chances against him. This threw him into a panic, and he turned and ran up the creek-bed along the old, dim trail. The dog joined in behind and kept up with him. He ran blindly, without intention, in fear such as he had never known in his life. Slowly, as he ploughed and floundered through the snow, he began to see things again--the banks of the creek, the old timber-jams, the leafless aspens, and the sky. The running made him feel better. He did not shiver. Maybe, if he ran on, his feet would thaw out; and, anyway, if he ran far enough, he would reach camp and the boys. Without doubt he would lose some fingers and toes and some of his face; but the boys would take care of him, and save the rest of him when he got there. And at the same time there was another thought in his mind that said he would never get to the camp and the boys; that it was too many miles away, that the freezing had too great a start on him, and that he would soon be stiff and dead. This thought he kept in the background and refused to consider. Sometimes it pushed itself forward and demanded to be heard, but he thrust it back and strove to think of other things.  <br><br>  It struck him as curious that he could run at all on feet so frozen that he could not feel them when they struck the earth and took the weight of his body. He seemed to himself to skim along above the surface and to have no connection with the earth. Somewhere he had once seen a winged Mercury, and he wondered if Mercury felt as he felt when skimming over the earth.  <br><br>  His theory of running until he reached camp and the boys had one flaw in it: he lacked the endurance. Several times he stumbled, and finally he tottered, crumpled up, and fell. When he tried to rise, he failed. He must sit and rest, he decided, and next time he would merely walk and keep on going. As he sat and regained his breath, he noted that he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He was not shivering, and it even seemed that a warm glow had come to his chest and trunk. And yet, when he touched his nose or cheeks, there was no sensation. Running would not thaw them out. Nor would it thaw out his hands and feet. Then the thought came to him that the frozen portions of his body must be extending. He tried to keep this thought down, to forget it, to think of something else; he was aware of the panicky feeling that it caused, and he was afraid of the panic. But the thought asserted itself, and persisted, until it produced a vision of his body totally frozen. This was too much, and he made another wild run along the trail. Once he slowed down to a walk, but the thought of the freezing extending itself made him run again.  <br><br>  And all the time the dog ran with him, at his heels. When he fell down a second time, it curled its tail over its forefeet and sat in front of him facing him curiously eager and intent. The warmth and security of the animal angered him, and he cursed it till it flattened down its ears appeasingly. This time the shivering came more quickly upon the man. He was losing in his battle with the frost. It was creeping into his body from all sides. The thought of it drove him on, but he ran no more than a hundred feet, when he staggered and pitched headlong. It was his last panic. When he had recovered his breath and control, he sat up and entertained in his mind the conception of meeting death with dignity. However, the conception did not come to him in such terms. His idea of it was that he had been making a fool of himself, running around like a chicken with its head cut off--such was the simile that occurred to him. Well, he was bound to freeze anyway, and he might as well take it decently. With this new-found peace of mind came the first glimmerings of drowsiness. A good idea, he thought, to sleep off to death. It was like taking an anaesthetic. Freezing was not so bad as people thought. There were lots worse ways to die.  <br><br>  He pictured the boys finding his body next day. Suddenly he found himself with them, coming along the trail and looking for himself. And, still with them, he came around a turn in the trail and found himself lying in the snow. He did not belong with himself any more, for even then he was out of himself, standing with the boys and looking at himself in the snow. It certainly was cold, was his thought. When he got back to the States he could tell the folks what real cold was. He drifted on from this to a vision of the old-timer on Sulphur Creek. He could see him quite clearly, warm and comfortable, and smoking a pipe.  <br><br>  ""You were right, old hoss; you were right,"" the man mumbled to the old-timer of Sulphur Creek.  <br><br>  Then the man drowsed off into what seemed to him the most comfortable and satisfying sleep he had ever known. The dog sat facing him and waiting. The brief day drew to a close in a long, slow twilight. There were no signs of a fire to be made, and, besides, never in the dog's experience had it known a man to sit like that in the snow and make no fire. As the twilight drew on, its eager yearning for the fire mastered it, and with a great lifting and shifting of forefeet, it whined softly, then flattened its ears down in anticipation of being chidden by the man. But the man remained silent. Later, the dog whined loudly. And still later it crept close to the man and caught the scent of death. This made the animal bristle and back away. A little longer it delayed, howling under the stars that leaped and danced and shone brightly in the cold sky. Then it turned and trotted up the trail in the direction of the camp it knew, where were the other food-providers and fire-providers.                             <br><br>"
9,The Luck Of Roaring Camp - By Bret Harte,"There was commotion in Roaring Camp. It could not have been a fight, for in 1850 that was not novel enough to have called together the entire settlement. The ditches and claims were not only deserted, but ""Tuttle's grocery"" had contributed its gamblers, who, it will be remembered, calmly continued their game the day that French Pete and Kanaka Joe shot each other to death over the bar in the front room. The whole camp was collected before a rude cabin on the outer edge of the clearing. Conversation was carried on in a low tone, but the name of a woman was frequently repeated. It was a name familiar enough in the camp,--""Cherokee Sal.""  <br><br>  Perhaps the less said of her the better. She was a coarse and, it is to be feared, a very sinful woman. But at that time she was the only woman in Roaring Camp, and was just then lying in sore extremity, when she most needed the ministration of her own sex. Dissolute, abandoned, and irreclaimable, she was yet suffering a martyrdom hard enough to bear even when veiled by sympathizing womanhood, but now terrible in her loneliness. The primal curse had come to her in that original isolation which must have made the punishment of the first transgression so dreadful. It was, perhaps, part of the expiation of her sin that, at a moment when she most lacked her sex's intuitive tenderness and care, she met only the half-contemptuous faces of her masculine associates. Yet a few of the spectators were, I think, touched by her sufferings. Sandy Tipton thought it was ""rough on Sal,"" and, in the contemplation of her condition, for a moment rose superior to the fact that he had an ace and two bowers in his sleeve.  <br><br>  It will be seen also that the situation was novel. Deaths were by no means uncommon in Roaring Camp, but a birth was a new thing. People had been dismissed the camp effectively, finally, and with no possibility of return; but this was the first time that anybody had been introduced AB INITIO. Hence the excitement.  <br><br>  ""You go in there, Stumpy,"" said a prominent citizen known as ""Kentuck,"" addressing one of the loungers. ""Go in there, and see what you kin do. You've had experience in them things.""  <br><br>  Perhaps there was a fitness in the selection. Stumpy, in other climes, had been the putative head of two families; in fact, it was owing to some legal informality in these proceedings that Roaring Camp--a city of refuge--was indebted to his company. The crowd approved the choice, and Stumpy was wise enough to bow to the majority. The door closed on the extempore surgeon and midwife, and Roaring Camp sat down outside, smoked its pipe, and awaited the issue.  <br><br>  The assemblage numbered about a hundred men. One or two of these were actual fugitives from justice, some were criminal, and all were reckless. Physically they exhibited no indication of their past lives and character. The greatest scamp had a Raphael face, with a profusion of blonde hair; Oakhurst, a gambler, had the melancholy air and intellectual abstraction of a Hamlet; the coolest and most courageous man was scarcely over five feet in height, with a soft voice and an embarrassed, timid manner. The term ""roughs"" applied to them was a distinction rather than a definition. Perhaps in the minor details of fingers, toes, ears, etc., the camp may have been deficient, but these slight omissions did not detract from their aggregate force. The strongest man had but three fingers on his right hand; the best shot had but one eye.  <br><br>  Such was the physical aspect of the men that were dispersed around the cabin. The camp lay in a triangular valley between two hills and a river. The only outlet was a steep trail over the summit of a hill that faced the cabin, now illuminated by the rising moon. The suffering woman might have seen it from the rude bunk whereon she lay,--seen it winding like a silver thread until it was lost in the stars above.  <br><br>  A fire of withered pine boughs added sociability to the gathering. By degrees the natural levity of Roaring Camp returned. Bets were freely offered and taken regarding the result. Three to five that ""Sal would get through with it;"" even that the child would survive; side bets as to the sex and complexion of the coming stranger. In the midst of an excited discussion an exclamation came from those nearest the door, and the camp stopped to listen. Above the swaying and moaning of the pines, the swift rush of the river, and the crackling of the fire rose a sharp, querulous cry,--a cry unlike anything heard before in the camp. The pines stopped moaning, the river ceased to rush, and the fire to crackle. It seemed as if Nature had stopped to listen too.  <br><br>  The camp rose to its feet as one man! It was proposed to explode a barrel of gunpowder; but in consideration of the situation of the mother, better counsels prevailed, and only a few revolvers were discharged; for whether owing to the rude surgery of the camp, or some other reason, Cherokee Sal was sinking fast. Within an hour she had climbed, as it were, that rugged road that led to the stars, and so passed out of Roaring Camp, its sin and shame, forever. I do not think that the announcement disturbed them much, except in speculation as to the fate of the child. ""Can he live now?"" was asked of Stumpy. The answer was doubtful. The only other being of Cherokee Sal's sex and maternal condition in the settlement was an ass. There was some conjecture as to fitness, but the experiment was tried. It was less problematical than the ancient treatment of Romulus and Remus, and apparently as successful.  <br><br>  When these details were completed, which exhausted another hour, the door was opened, and the anxious crowd of men, who had already formed themselves into a queue, entered in single file. Beside the low bunk or shelf, on which the figure of the mother was starkly outlined below the blankets, stood a pine table. On this a candle- box was placed, and within it, swathed in staring red flannel, lay the last arrival at Roaring Camp. Beside the candle-box was placed a hat. Its use was soon indicated. ""Gentlemen,"" said Stumpy, with a singular mixture of authority and EX OFFICIO complacency,-- ""gentlemen will please pass in at the front door, round the table, and out at the back door. Them as wishes to contribute anything toward the orphan will find a hat handy."" The first man entered with his hat on; he uncovered, however, as he looked about him, and so unconsciously set an example to the next. In such communities good and bad actions are catching. As the procession filed in comments were audible,--criticisms addressed perhaps rather to Stumpy in the character of showman; ""Is that him?"" ""Mighty small specimen;"" ""Has n't more 'n got the color;"" ""Ain't bigger nor a derringer."" The contributions were as characteristic: A silver tobacco box; a doubloon; a navy revolver, silver mounted; a gold specimen; a very beautifully embroidered lady's handkerchief (from Oakhurst the gambler); a diamond breastpin; a diamond ring (suggested by the pin, with the remark from the giver that he ""saw that pin and went two diamonds better""); a slung-shot; a Bible (contributor not detected); a golden spur; a silver teaspoon (the initials, I regret to say, were not the giver's); a pair of surgeon's shears; a lancet; a Bank of England note for 5 pounds; and about $200 in loose gold and silver coin. During these proceedings Stumpy maintained a silence as impassive as the dead on his left, a gravity as inscrutable as that of the newly born on his right. Only one incident occurred to break the monotony of the curious procession. As Kentuck bent over the candle-box half curiously, the child turned, and, in a spasm of pain, caught at his groping finger, and held it fast for a moment. Kentuck looked foolish and embarrassed. Something like a blush tried to assert itself in his weather-beaten cheek. ""The damned little cuss!"" he said, as he extricated his finger, with perhaps more tenderness and care than he might have been deemed capable of showing. He held that finger a little apart from its fellows as he went out, and examined it curiously. The examination provoked the same original remark in regard to the child. In fact, he seemed to enjoy repeating it. ""He rastled with my finger,"" he remarked to Tipton, holding up the member, ""the damned little cuss!""  <br><br>  It was four o'clock before the camp sought repose. A light burnt in the cabin where the watchers sat, for Stumpy did not go to bed that night. Nor did Kentuck. He drank quite freely, and related with great gusto his experience, invariably ending with his characteristic condemnation of the newcomer. It seemed to relieve him of any unjust implication of sentiment, and Kentuck had the weaknesses of the nobler sex. When everybody else had gone to bed, he walked down to the river and whistled reflectingly. Then he walked up the gulch past the cabin, still whistling with demonstrative unconcern. At a large redwood-tree he paused and retraced his steps, and again passed the cabin. Halfway down to the river's bank he again paused, and then returned and knocked at the door. It was opened by Stumpy. ""How goes it?"" said Kentuck, looking past Stumpy toward the candle-box. ""All serene!"" replied Stumpy. ""Anything up?"" ""Nothing."" There was a pause--an embarrassing one--Stumpy still holding the door. Then Kentuck had recourse to his finger, which he held up to Stumpy. ""Rastled with it,--the damned little cuss,"" he said, and retired.  <br><br>  The next day Cherokee Sal had such rude sepulture as Roaring Camp afforded. After her body had been committed to the hillside, there was a formal meeting of the camp to discuss what should be done with her infant. A resolution to adopt it was unanimous and enthusiastic. But an animated discussion in regard to the manner and feasibility of providing for its wants at once sprang up. It was remarkable that the argument partook of none of those fierce personalities with which discussions were usually conducted at Roaring Camp. Tipton proposed that they should send the child to Red Dog,--a distance of forty miles,--where female attention could be procured. But the unlucky suggestion met with fierce and unanimous opposition. It was evident that no plan which entailed parting from their new acquisition would for a moment be entertained. ""Besides,"" said Tom Ryder, ""them fellows at Red Dog would swap it, and ring in somebody else on us."" A disbelief in the honesty of other camps prevailed at Roaring Camp, as in other places.  <br><br>  The introduction of a female nurse in the camp also met with objection. It was argued that no decent woman could be prevailed to accept Roaring Camp as her home, and the speaker urged that ""they didn't want any more of the other kind."" This unkind allusion to the defunct mother, harsh as it may seem, was the first spasm of propriety,--the first symptom of the camp's regeneration. Stumpy advanced nothing. Perhaps he felt a certain delicacy in interfering with the selection of a possible successor in office. But when questioned, he averred stoutly that he and ""Jinny""--the mammal before alluded to--could manage to rear the child. There was something original, independent, and heroic about the plan that pleased the camp. Stumpy was retained. Certain articles were sent for to Sacramento. ""Mind,"" said the treasurer, as he pressed a bag of gold-dust into the expressman's hand, ""the best that can be got,--lace, you know, and filigree-work and frills,--damn the cost!""  <br><br>  Strange to say, the child thrived. Perhaps the invigorating climate of the mountain camp was compensation for material deficiencies. Nature took the foundling to her broader breast. In that rare atmosphere of the Sierra foothills,--that air pungent with balsamic odor, that ethereal cordial at once bracing and exhilarating,--he may have found food and nourishment, or a subtle chemistry that transmuted ass's milk to lime and phosphorus. Stumpy inclined to the belief that it was the latter and good nursing. ""Me and that ass,"" he would say, ""has been father and mother to him! Don't you,"" he would add, apostrophizing the helpless bundle before him, ""never go back on us.""  <br><br>  By the time he was a month old the necessity of giving him a name became apparent. He had generally been known as ""The Kid,"" ""Stumpy's Boy,"" ""The Coyote"" (an allusion to his vocal powers), and even by Kentuck's endearing diminutive of ""The damned little cuss."" But these were felt to be vague and unsatisfactory, and were at last dismissed under another influence. Gamblers and adventurers are generally superstitious, and Oakhurst one day declared that the baby had brought ""the luck"" to Roaring Camp. It was certain that of late they had been successful. ""Luck"" was the name agreed upon, with the prefix of Tommy for greater convenience. No allusion was made to the mother, and the father was unknown. ""It's better,"" said the philosophical Oakhurst, ""to take a fresh deal all round. Call him Luck, and start him fair."" A day was accordingly set apart for the christening. What was meant by this ceremony the reader may imagine who has already gathered some idea of the reckless irreverence of Roaring Camp. The master of ceremonies was one ""Boston,"" a noted wag, and the occasion seemed to promise the greatest facetiousness. This ingenious satirist had spent two days in preparing a burlesque of the Church service, with pointed local allusions. The choir was properly trained, and Sandy Tipton was to stand godfather. But after the procession had marched to the grove with music and banners, and the child had been deposited before a mock altar, Stumpy stepped before the expectant crowd. ""It ain't my style to spoil fun, boys,"" said the little man, stoutly eyeing the faces around him,"" but it strikes me that this thing ain't exactly on the squar. It's playing it pretty low down on this yer baby to ring in fun on him that he ain't goin' to understand. And ef there's goin' to be any godfathers round, I'd like to see who's got any better rights than me."" A silence followed Stumpy's speech. To the credit of all humorists be it said that the first man to acknowledge its justice was the satirist thus stopped of his fun. ""But,"" said Stumpy, quickly following up his advantage, ""we're here for a christening, and we'll have it. I proclaim you Thomas Luck, according to the laws of the United States and the State of California, so help me God."" It was the first time that the name of the Deity had been otherwise uttered than profanely in the camp. The form of christening was perhaps even more ludicrous than the satirist had conceived; but strangely enough, nobody saw it and nobody laughed. ""Tommy"" was christened as seriously as he would have been under a Christian roof and cried and was comforted in as orthodox fashion.  <br><br>  And so the work of regeneration began in Roaring Camp. Almost imperceptibly a change came over the settlement. The cabin assigned to ""Tommy Luck""--or ""The Luck,"" as he was more frequently called--first showed signs of improvement. It was kept scrupulously clean and whitewashed. Then it was boarded, clothed, and papered. The rose wood cradle, packed eighty miles by mule, had, in Stumpy's way of putting it, ""sorter killed the rest of the furniture."" So the rehabilitation of the cabin became a necessity. The men who were in the habit of lounging in at Stumpy's to see ""how 'The Luck' got on"" seemed to appreciate the change, and in self-defense the rival establishment of ""Tuttle's grocery"" bestirred itself and imported a carpet and mirrors. The reflections of the latter on the appearance of Roaring Camp tended to produce stricter habits of personal cleanliness. Again Stumpy imposed a kind of quarantine upon those who aspired to the honor and privilege of holding The Luck. It was a cruel mortification to Kentuck--who, in the carelessness of a large nature and the habits of frontier life, had begun to regard all garments as a second cuticle, which, like a snake's, only sloughed off through decay--to be debarred this privilege from certain prudential reasons. Yet such was the subtle influence of innovation that he thereafter appeared regularly every afternoon in a clean shirt and face still shining from his ablutions. Nor were moral and social sanitary laws neglected. ""Tommy,"" who was supposed to spend his whole existence in a persistent attempt to repose, must not be disturbed by noise. The shouting and yelling, which had gained the camp its infelicitous title, were not permitted within hearing distance of Stumpy's. The men conversed in whispers or smoked with Indian gravity. Profanity was tacitly given up in these sacred precincts, and throughout the camp a popular form of expletive, known as ""D--n the luck!"" and ""Curse the luck!"" was abandoned, as having a new personal bearing. Vocal music was not interdicted, being supposed to have a soothing, tranquilizing quality; and one song, sung by ""Man-o'-War Jack,"" an English sailor from her Majesty's Australian colonies, was quite popular as a lullaby. It was a lugubrious recital of the exploits of ""the Arethusa, Seventy-four,"" in a muffled minor, ending with a prolonged dying fall at the burden of each verse, ""On b-oo-o-ard of the Arethusa."" It was a fine sight to see Jack holding The Luck, rocking from side to side as if with the motion of a ship, and crooning forth this naval ditty. Either through the peculiar rocking of Jack or the length of his song,--it contained ninety stanzas, and was continued with conscientious deliberation to the bitter end,--the lullaby generally had the desired effect. At such times the men would lie at full length under the trees in the soft summer twilight, smoking their pipes and drinking in the melodious utterances. An indistinct idea that this was pastoral happiness pervaded the camp. ""This 'ere kind o' think,"" said the Cockney Simmons, meditatively reclining on his elbow, ""is 'evingly."" It reminded him of Greenwich.  <br><br>  On the long summer days The Luck was usually carried to the gulch from whence the golden store of Roaring Camp was taken. There, on a blanket spread over pine boughs, he would lie while the men were working in the ditches below. Latterly there was a rude attempt to decorate this bower with flowers and sweet-smelling shrubs, and generally some one would bring him a cluster of wild honeysuckles, azaleas, or the painted blossoms of Las Mariposas. The men had suddenly awakened to the fact that there were beauty and significance in these trifles, which they had so long trodden carelessly beneath their feet. A flake of glittering mica, a fragment of variegated quartz, a bright pebble from the bed of the creek, became beautiful to eyes thus cleared and strengthened, and were invariably pat aside for The Luck. It was wonderful how many treasures the woods and hillsides yielded that ""would do for Tommy."" Surrounded by playthings such as never child out of fairyland had before, it is to he hoped that Tommy was content. He appeared to be serenely happy, albeit there was an infantine gravity about him, a contemplative light in his round gray eyes, that sometimes worried Stumpy. He was always tractable and quiet, and it is recorded that once, having crept beyond his ""corral,""--a hedge of tessellated pine boughs, which surrounded his bed,--he dropped over the bank on his head in the soft earth, and remained with his mottled legs in the air in that position for at least five minutes with unflinching gravity. He was extricated without a murmur. I hesitate to record the many other instances of his sagacity, which rest, unfortunately, upon the statements of prejudiced friends. Some of them were not without a tinge of superstition. ""I crep' up the bank just now,"" said Kentuck one day, in a breathless state of excitement ""and dern my skin if he was a-talking to a jay bird as was a-sittin' on his lap. There they was, just as free and sociable as anything you please, a- jawin' at each other just like two cherrybums."" Howbeit, whether creeping over the pine boughs or lying lazily on his back blinking at the leaves above him, to him the birds sang, the squirrels chattered, and the flowers bloomed. Nature was his nurse and playfellow. For him she would let slip between the leaves golden shafts of sunlight that fell just within his grasp; she would send wandering breezes to visit him with the balm of bay and resinous gum; to him the tall redwoods nodded familiarly and sleepily, the bumblebees buzzed, and the rooks cawed a slumbrous accompaniment.  <br><br>  Such was the golden summer of Roaring Camp. They were ""flush times,"" and the luck was with them. The claims had yielded enormously. The camp was jealous of its privileges and looked suspiciously on strangers. No encouragement was given to immigration, and, to make their seclusion more perfect, the land on either side of the mountain wall that surrounded the camp they duly preempted. This, and a reputation for singular proficiency with the revolver, kept the reserve of Roaring Camp inviolate. The expressman--their only connecting link with the surrounding world-- sometimes told wonderful stories of the camp. He would say, ""They've a street up there in 'Roaring' that would lay over any street in Red Dog. They've got vines and flowers round their houses, and they wash themselves twice a day. But they're mighty rough on strangers, and they worship an Ingin baby.""  <br><br>  With the prosperity of the camp came a desire for further improvement. It was proposed to build a hotel in the following spring, and to invite one or two decent families to reside there for the sake of The Luck, who might perhaps profit by female companionship. The sacrifice that this concession to the sex cost these men, who were fiercely skeptical in regard to its general virtue and usefulness, can only be accounted for by their affection for Tommy. A few still held out. But the resolve could not be carried into effect for three months, and the minority meekly yielded in the hope that something might turn up to prevent it. And it did.  <br><br>  The winter of 1851 will long be remembered in the foothills. The snow lay deep on the Sierras, and every mountain creek became a river, and every river a lake. Each gorge and gulch was transformed into a tumultuous watercourse that descended the hillsides, tearing down giant trees and scattering its drift and debris along the plain. Red Dog had been twice under water, and Roaring Camp had been forewarned. ""Water put the gold into them gulches,"" said Stumpy. ""It been here once and will be here again!"" And that night the North Fork suddenly leaped over its banks and swept up the triangular valley of Roaring Camp.  <br><br>  In the confusion of rushing water, crashing trees, and crackling timber, and the darkness which seemed to flow with the water and blot out the fair valley, but little could be done to collect the scattered camp. When the morning broke, the cabin of Stumpy, nearest the river-bank, was gone. Higher up the gulch they found the body of its unlucky owner; but the pride, the hope, the joy, The Luck, of Roaring Camp had disappeared. They were returning with sad hearts when a shout from the bank recalled them.  <br><br>  It was a relief-boat from down the river. They had picked up, they said, a man and an infant, nearly exhausted, about two miles below. Did anybody know them, and did they belong here?  <br><br>  It needed but a glance to show them Kentuck lying there, cruelly crushed and bruised, but still holding The Luck of Roaring Camp in his arms. As they bent over the strangely assorted pair, they saw that the child was cold and pulseless. ""He is dead,"" said one. Kentuck opened his eyes. ""Dead?"" he repeated feebly. ""Yes, my man, and you are dying too."" A smile lit the eyes of the expiring Kentuck. ""Dying!"" he repeated; ""he's a-taking me with him. Tell the boys I've got The Luck with me now;"" and the strong man, clinging to the frail babe as a drowning man is said to cling to a straw, drifted away into the shadowy river that flows forever to the unknown sea.                               <br><br>"
10,Regret - By Kate Chopin,"MAMZELLE AURLIE possessed a good strong figure, ruddy cheeks, hair that was changing from brown to gray, and a determined eye. She wore a man's hat about the farm, and an old blue army overcoat when it was cold, and sometimes top-boots.  <br><br>  Mamzelle Aurlie had never thought of marrying. She had never been in love. At the age of twenty she had received a proposal, which she had promptly declined, and at the age of fifty she had not yet lived to regret it.  <br><br>  So she was quite alone in the world, except for her dog Ponto, and the negroes who lived in her cabins and worked her crops, and the fowls, a few cows, a couple of mules, her gun (with which she shot chicken-hawks), and her religion.  <br><br>  One morning Mamzelle Aurlie stood upon her gallery, contemplating, with arms akimbo, a small band of very small children who, to all intents and purposes, might have fallen from the clouds, so unexpected and bewildering was their coming, and so unwelcome. They were the children of her nearest neighbor, Odile, who was not such a near neighbor, after all.  <br><br>  The young woman had appeared but five minutes before, accompanied by these four children. In her arms she carried little Lodie; she dragged Ti Nomme by an unwilling hand; while Marcline and Marclette followed with irresolute steps.  <br><br>  Her face was red and disfigured from tears and excitement. She had been summoned to a neighboring parish by the dangerous illness of her mother; her husband was away in Texas -- it seemed to her a million miles away; and Valsin was waiting with the mule-cart to drive her to the station.  <br><br>  ""It's no question, Mamzelle Aurlie; you jus' got to keep those youngsters fo' me tell I come back. Dieu sait, I wouldn' botha you with 'em if it was any otha way to do! Make 'em mine you, Mamzelle Aurlie; don' spare 'em. Me, there, I'm half crazy between the chil'ren, an' Lon not home, an' maybe not even to fine po' maman alive encore!"" -- a harrowing possibility which drove Odile to take a final hasty and convulsive leave of her disconsolate family.  <br><br>  She left them crowded into the narrow strip of shade on the porch of the long, low house; the white sunlight was beating in on the white old boards; some chickens were scratching in the grass at the foot of the steps, and one had boldly mounted, and was stepping heavily, solemnly, and aimlessly across the gallery. There was a pleasant odor of pinks in the air, and the sound of negroes' laughter was coming across the flowering cotton-field.  <br><br>  Mamzelle Aurlie stood contemplating the children. She looked with a critical eye upon Marcline, who had been left staggering beneath the weight of the chubby Lodie. She surveyed with the same calculating air Marclette mingling her silent tears with the audible grief and rebellion of Ti Nomme. During those few contemplative moments she was collecting herself, determining upon a line of action which should be identical with a line of duty. She began by feeding them.  <br><br>  If Mamzelle Aurlie's responsibilities might have begun and ended there, they could easily have been dismissed; for her larder was amply provided against an emergency of this nature. But little children are not little pigs: they require and demand attentions which were wholly unexpected by Mamzelle Aurlie, and which she was ill prepared to give.  <br><br>  She was, indeed, very inapt in her management of Odile's children during the first few days. How could she know that Marclette always wept when spoken to in a loud and commanding tone of voice? It was a peculiarity of Marclette's. She became acquainted with Ti Nomme's passion for flowers only when he had plucked all the choicest gardenias and pinks for the apparent purpose of critically studying their botanical construction.  <br><br>  ""'T ain't enough to tell 'im, Mamzelle Aurlie,"" Marcline instructed her; ""you got to tie 'im in a chair. It's w'at maman all time do w'en he's bad: she tie 'im in a chair."" The chair in which Mamzelle Aurlie tied Ti Nomme was roomy and comfortable, and he seized the opportunity to take a nap in it, the afternoon being warm.  <br><br>  At night, when she ordered them one and all to bed as she would have shooed the chickens into the hen-house, they stayed uncomprehending before her. What about the little white nightgowns that had to be taken from the pillow-slip in which they were brought over, and shaken by some strong hand till they snapped like ox-whips? What about the tub of water which had to be brought and set in the middle of the floor, in which the little tired, dusty, sun-browned feet had every one to be washed sweet and clean? And it made Marcline and Marclette laugh merrily -- the idea that Mamzelle Aurlie should for a moment have believed that Ti Nomme could fall asleep without being told the story of Croque-mitaine or Loup-garou, or both; or that lodie could fall asleep at all without being rocked and sung to.  <br><br>  ""I tell you, Aunt Ruby,"" Mamzelle Aurlie informed her cook in confidence; ""me, I'd rather manage a dozen plantation' than fo' chil'ren. It's terrassent! Bont! don't talk to me about chil'ren!""  <br><br>  ""T ain' ispected sich as you would know airy thing 'bout 'em, Mamzelle Aurlie. I see dat plainly yistiddy w'en I spy dat li'le chile playin' wid yo' baskit o' keys. You don' know dat makes chillun grow up hard-headed, to play wid keys? Des like it make 'em teeth hard to look in a lookin'-glass. Them's the things you got to know in the raisin' an' manigement o' chillun.""  <br><br>  Mamzelle Aurlie certainly did not pretend or aspire to such subtle and far-reaching knowledge on the subject as Aunt Ruby possessed, who had ""raised five an' buried six"" in her day. She was glad enough to learn a few little mother-tricks to serve the moment's need.  <br><br>  Ti Nomme's sticky fingers compelled her to unearth white aprons that she had not worn for years, and she had to accustom herself to his moist kisses -- the expressions of an affectionate and exuberant nature. She got down her sewing-basket, which she seldom used, from the top shelf of the armoire, and placed it within the ready and easy reach which torn slips and buttonless waists demanded. It took her some days to become accustomed to the laughing, the crying, the chattering that echoed through the house and around it all day long. And it was not the first or the second night that she could sleep comfortably with little Lodie's hot, plump body pressed close against her, and the little one's warm breath beating her cheek like the fanning of a bird's wing.  <br><br>  But at the end of two weeks Mamzelle Aurlie had grown quite used to these things, and she no longer complained.  <br><br>  It was also at the end of two weeks that Mamzelle Aurlie, one evening, looking away toward the crib where the cattle were being fed, saw Valsin's blue cart turning the bend of the road. Odile sat beside the mulatto, upright and alert. As they drew near, the young woman's beaming face indicated that her home-coming was a happy one.  <br><br>  But this coming, unannounced and unexpected, threw Mamzelle Aurlie into a flutter that was almost agitation. The children had to be gathered. Where was Ti Nomme? Yonder in the shed, putting an edge on his knife at the grindstone. And Marcline and Marclette? Cutting and fashioning doll-rags in the corner of the gallery. As for Lodie, she was safe enough in Mamzelle Aurlie's arms; and she had screamed with delight at sight of the familiar blue cart which was bringing her mother back to her.  <br><br>  THE excitement was all over, and they were gone. How still it was when they were gone! Mamzelle Aurlie stood upon the gallery, looking and listening. She could no longer see the cart; the red sunset and the blue-gray twilight had together flung a purple mist across the fields and road that hid it from her view. She could no longer hear the wheezing and creaking of its wheels. But she could still faintly hear the shrill, glad voices of the children.  <br><br>  She turned into the house. There was much work awaiting her, for the children had left a sad disorder behind them; but she did not at once set about the task of righting it. Mamzelle Aurlie seated herself beside the table. She gave one slow glance through the room, into which the evening shadows were creeping and deepening around her solitary figure. She let her head fall down upon her bended arm, and began to cry. Oh, but she cried! Not softly, as women often do. She cried like a man, with sobs that seemed to tear her very soul. She did not notice Ponto licking her hand.                             <br><br>"
11,The Celebrated Jumping Frog Of Calaveras County - By Mark Twain,"  In compliance with the request of a friend of mine, who wrote me from  the East, I called on good-natured, garrulous old Simon Wheeler, and  inquired after my friend's friend, Leonidas W. Smiley, as requested to  do, and I hereunto append the result. I have a lurking suspicion that  <i>Leonidas W</i>. Smiley is a myth; and that my friend never knew such a  personage; and that he only conjectured that if I asked old Wheeler  about him, it would remind him of his infamous <i>Jim Smiley</i>, and he  would go to work and bore me to death with some exasperating  reminiscence of him as long and as tedious as it should be useless to  me. If that was the design, it succeeded.<br><br>I found Simon Wheeler dozing comfortably by the barroom stove of the  dilapidated tavern in the decayed mining camp of Angel's, and I  noticed that he was fat and bald-headed, and had an expression of  winning gentleness and simplicity upon his tranquil countenance. He  roused up, and gave me good-day. I told him a friend had commissioned  me to make some inquiries about a cherished companion of his boyhood  named <i>Leonidas W</i>. Smiley--<i>Rev. Leonidas W.</i> Smiley, a young  minister of the Gospel, who he had heard was at one time a resident of  Angel's Camp. I added that if Mr. Wheeler could tell me anything about  this Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, I would feel under many obligations to  him.<br><br>Simon Wheeler backed me into a corner and blockaded me there with his  chair, and then sat down and reeled off the monotonous narrative which  follows this paragraph. He never smiled, he never frowned, he never  changed his voice from the gentle-flowing key to which he tuned his  initial sentence, he never betrayed the slightest suspicion of  enthusiasm; but all through the interminable narrative there ran a  vein of impressive earnestness and sincerity, which showed me plainly  that, so far from his imagining that there was anything ridiculous or  funny about his story, he regarded it as a really important matter,  and admired its two heroes as men of transcendent genius in <i>finesse</i>.  I let him go on in his own way, and never interrupted him once.<br><br>""Rev. Leonidas W. H'm, Reverend Le--well, there was a feller here once  by the name of <i>Jim</i> Smiley, in the winter of '49--or may be it was  the spring of '50--I don't recollect exactly, somehow, though what  makes me think it was one or the other is because I remember the big  flume warn't finished when he first came to the camp; but any way, he  was the curiousest man about always betting on anything that turned up  you ever see, if he could get anybody to bet on the other side; and if  he couldn't he'd change sides. Any way that suited the other man would  suit <i>him</i>--any way just so's he got a bet, <i>he</i> was satisfied. But  still he was lucky, uncommon lucky; he most always come out winner. He  was always ready and laying for a chance; there couldn't be no  solit'ry thing mentioned but that feller'd offer to bet on it, and  take any side you please, as I was just telling you. If there was a  horse-race, you'd find him flush or you'd find him busted at the end  of it; if there was a dog-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was a  cat-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was a chicken-fight, he'd bet on  it; why, if there was two birds setting on a fence, he would bet you  which one would fly first; or if there was a camp-meeting, he would be  there reg'lar to bet on Parson Walker, which he judged to be the best  exhorter about here, and he was, too, and a good man. If he even see a  straddle-bug start to go anywheres, he would bet you how long it would  take him to get to--to wherever he <i>was</i> going to, and if you took him  up, he would foller that straddle-bug to Mexico but what he would find  out where he was bound for and how long he was on the road.     <img class=""ssimg"" itemprop=""image"" src=""http://cdn.americanliterature.com/al/images/story/frog-mare.jpg"" alt=""Thish-yer Smiley had a mare.

Why, it  never made no difference to <i>him</i>--he'd bet on <i>any</i> thing--the  dangest feller. Parson Walker's wife laid very sick once, for a good  while, and it seemed as if they warn't going to save her; but one  morning he come in, and Smiley up and asked him how she was, and he  said she was considerable better--thank the Lord for his inf'nit'  mercy--and coming on so smart that with the blessing of Prov'dence  she'd get well yet; and Smiley, before he thought, says, Well, I'll  risk two-and-a-half she don't anyway.'""<br><br>Thish-yer Smiley had a mare--the boys called her the fifteen-minute  nag, but that was only in fun, you know, because, of course, she was  faster than that--and he used to win money on that horse, for all she  was so slow and always had the asthma, or the distemper, or the  consumption, or something of that kind. They used to give her two or  three hundred yards start, and then pass her under way; but always at  the fag-end of the race she'd get excited and desperate-like, and come  cavorting and straddling up, and scattering her legs around limber,  sometimes in the air, and sometimes out to one side amongst the  fences, and kicking up m-o-r-e dust and raising m-o-r-e racket with  her coughing and sneezing and blowing her nose--and always fetch up at  the stand just about a neck ahead, as near as you could cipher it  down.<br><br><img style=""float:left; margin-left: 8px; margin-right: 12px; margin-bottom: 10px;"" itemprop=""image"" src=""http://cdn.americanliterature.com/al/images/story/frog-dog.jpg"" alt=""And he had a little small bull-pup.

But as soon as money was up on him he was a  different dog; his under-jaw'd begin to stick out like the fo'-castle  of a steamboat, and his teeth would uncover and shine like the  furnaces. And a dog might tackle him and bully-rag him, and bite him,  and throw him over his shoulder two or three times, and Andrew  Jackson--which was the name of the pup--Andrew Jackson would never let  on but what <i>he</i> was satisfied, and hadn't expected nothing else--and  the bets being doubled and doubled on the other side all the time,  till the money was all up; and then all of a sudden he would grab that  other dog jest by the j'int of his hind leg and freeze to it--not  chaw, you understand, but only just grip and hang on till they throwed  up the sponge, if it was a year. Smiley always come out winner on that  pup, till he harnessed a dog once that didn't have no hind legs,  because they'd been sawed off in a circular saw, and when the thing  had gone along far enough, and the money was all up, and he come to  make a snatch for his pet holt, he see in a minute how he'd been  imposed on, and how the other dog had him in the door, so to speak,  and he 'peared surprised, and then he looked sorter discouraged-like,  and didn't try no more to win the fight, and so he got shucked out  bad. He gave Smiley a look, as much as to say his heart was broke, and  it was <i>his</i> fault, for putting up a dog that hadn't no hind legs for  him to take holt of, which was his main dependence in a fight, and  then he limped off a piece and laid down and died. It was a good pup,  was that Andrew Jackson, and would have made a name for hisself if  he'd lived, for the stuff was in him and he had genius--I know it,  because he hadn't no opportunities to speak of, and it don't stand to  reason that a dog could make such a fight as he could under them  circumstances if he hadn't no talent. It always makes me feel sorry  when I think of that last fight of his'n, and the way it turned out.<br><br>Well, thish-yer Smiley had rat-tarriers, and chicken cocks, and  tom-cats and all of them kind of things, till you couldn't rest, and  you couldn't fetch nothing for him to bet on but he'd match you. He  ketched a frog one day, and took him home, and said he cal'lated to  educate him; and so he never done nothing for three months but set in  his back yard and learn that frog to jump. And you bet you he <i>did</i>  learn him, too. He'd give him a little punch behind, and the next  minute you'd see that frog whirling in the air like a doughnut--see  him turn one summerset, or may be a couple, if he got a good start,  and come down flat-footed and all right, like a cat.   <br><br><center>  <img itemprop=""image"" src=""http://cdn.americanliterature.com/al/images/story/frog-summerset.jpg"" alt=""An illustration of a frog summersetting for the great short story The  Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County by the author Mark Twain"" pagespeed_url_hash=""1738167470""/>  </center><br><br>  He got him up so  in the matter of ketching flies, and kep' him in practice so constant,  that he'd nail a fly every time as fur as he could see him. Smiley  said all a frog wanted was education, and he could do 'most  anything--and I believe him. Why, I've seen him set Dan'l Webster down  here on this floor--Dan'l Webster was the name of the frog--and sing  out, ""Flies, Dan'l, flies!"" and quicker'n you could wink he'd spring  straight up and snake a fly off'n the counter there, and flop down on  the floor ag'in as solid as a gob of mud, and fall to scratching the  side of his head with his hind foot as indifferent as if he hadn't no  idea he'd been doin' any more'n any frog might do. You never see a  frog so modest and straightfor'ard as he was, for all he was so  gifted. And when it come to fair and square jumping on a dead level,  he could get over more ground at one straddle than any animal of his  breed you ever see. Jumping on a dead level was his strong suit, you  understand; and when it come to that, Smiley would ante up money on  him as long as he had a red. Smiley was monstrous proud of his frog,  and well he might be, for fellers that had traveled and been  everywheres, all said he laid over any frog that ever <i>they</i> see.<br><br><img style=""float:left; margin-left: 8px; margin-right: 12px; margin-bottom: 10px;"" itemprop=""image"" src=""http://cdn.americanliterature.com/al/images/story/frog-daniel-webster-400x653.jpg"" alt=""Smiley kep' the beast in a little lattice box.

One day a feller--a  stranger in the camp, he was--come acrost him with his box, and says:<br><br>""What might be that you've got in the box?""<br><br>And Smiley says, sorter indifferent-like, ""It might be a parrot, or it  might be a canary, maybe, but it ain't--it's only just a frog.""<br><br>And the feller took it, and looked at it careful, and turned it round  this way and that, and says, ""H'm--so 'tis. Well, what's <i>he</i> good  for?""<br><br>""Well,"" Smiley says, easy and careless, ""he's good enough for <i>one</i>  thing, I should judge--he can outjump any frog in Calaveras county.""<br><br>The feller took the box again, and took another long, particular look,  and give it back to Smiley, and says, very deliberate, ""Well,"" he  says, ""I don't see no p'ints about that frog that's any better'n any  other frog.""<br><br>""Maybe you don't,"" Smiley says. ""Maybe you understand frogs and maybe  you don't understand 'em; maybe you've had experience, and maybe you  ain't only a amature, as it were. Anyways, I've got <i>my</i> opinion and  I'll risk forty dollars that he can outjump any frog in Calaveras  County.""  <br><br>And the feller studied a minute, and then says, kinder sad like,  ""Well, I'm only a stranger here, and I ain't got no frog; but if I had  a frog, I'd bet you.""<br><br>And then Smiley says, ""That's all right--that's all right--if you'll  hold my box a minute, I'll go and get you a frog."" And so the feller  took the box, and put up his forty dollars along with Smiley's, and  set down to wait.<br><br>So he set there a good while thinking and thinking to his-self, and  then he got the frog out and prized his mouth open and took a teaspoon  and filled him full of quail shot--filled! him pretty near up to his  chin--and set him on the floor. Smiley he went to the swamp and  slopped around in the mud for a long time, and finally he ketched a  frog, and fetched him in, and give him to this feller, and says:<br><br>""Now, if you're ready, set him alongside of Dan'l, with his forepaws  just even with Dan'l's, and I'll give the word."" Then he says,  ""One--two--three--<i>git</i>!"" and him and the feller touched up the frogs  from behind, and the new frog hopped off lively, but Dan'l give a  heave, and hysted up his shoulders--so--like a Frenchman, but it  warn't no use--he couldn't budge; he was planted as solid as a church,  and he couldn't no more stir than if he was anchored out. Smiley was a  good deal surprised, and he was disgusted too, but he didn't have no  idea what the matter was, of course.<br><br>The feller took the money and started away; and when he was going out  at the door, he sorter jerked his thumb over his shoulder--so--at  Dan'l, and says again, very deliberate, ""Well,"" he says, ""<i>I</i> don't  see no p'ints about that frog that's any better'n any other frog.""<br><br>  <img class=""ssimg"" itemprop=""image"" src=""http://cdn.americanliterature.com/al/images/story/frog-upside-down.jpg"" alt=""An illustration for the great short story The  Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County by the author Mark Twain"" pagespeed_url_hash=""1169205272""/>    Smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at Dan'l a long  time, and at last says, ""I do wonder what in the nation that frog  throwed off for--I wonder if there ain't something the matter with  him--he 'pears to look mighty baggy, somehow."" And he ketched Dan'l up  by the nap of the neck, and hefted him, and says, ""Why blame my cats  if he don't weigh five pounds!"" and turned him upside down and he  belched out a double handful of shot. And then he see how it was, and  he was the maddest man--he set the frog down and took out after that  feller, but he never ketched him. And----<br><br>(Here Simon Wheeler heard his name called from the front yard, and got  up to see what was wanted.) And turning to me as he moved away, he  said: ""Just set where you are, stranger, and rest easy--I ain't going  to be gone a second.""<br><br>But, by your leave, I did not think that a continuation of the history  of the enterprising vagabond <i>Jim</i> Smiley would be likely to afford me  much information concerning the Rev. <i>Leonidas W.</i> Smiley, and so I  started away.<br><br>At the door I met the sociable Wheeler returning, and he buttonholed  me and recommenced:<br><br>""Well, thish-yer Smiley had a yaller, one-eyed cow that didn't have no  tail, only jest a short stump like a bannanner, and----""<br><br>However, lacking both time and inclination, I did not wait to hear  about the afflicted cow, but took my leave.                             <br><br>"
12,The Skylight Room - By O. Henry,"First Mrs. Parker would show you the double parlours. You would not  dare to interrupt her description of their advantages and of the  merits of the gentleman who had occupied them for eight years. Then  you would manage to stammer forth the confession that you were  neither a doctor nor a dentist. Mrs. Parker's manner of receiving  the admission was such that you could never afterward entertain the  same feeling toward your parents, who had neglected to train you up  in one of the professions that fitted Mrs. Parker's parlours.<br><br>    Next you ascended one flight of stairs and looked at the second-  floor-back at $8. Convinced by her second-floor manner that it was  worth the $12 that Mr. Toosenberry always paid for it until he left  to take charge of his brother's orange plantation in Florida near  Palm Beach, where Mrs. McIntyre always spent the winters that had the  double front room with private bath, you managed to babble that you  wanted something still cheaper.<br><br>    If you survived Mrs. Parker's scorn, you were taken to look at Mr.  Skidder's large hall room on the third floor. Mr. Skidder's room was  not vacant. He wrote plays and smoked cigarettes in it all day long.  But every room-hunter was made to visit his room to admire the  lambrequins. After each visit, Mr. Skidder, from the fright caused  by possible eviction, would pay something on his rent.<br><br>    Then--oh, then--if you still stood on one foot, with your hot hand  clutching the three moist dollars in your pocket, and hoarsely  proclaimed your hideous and culpable poverty, nevermore would Mrs.  Parker be cicerone of yours. She would honk loudly the word"" Clara,""  she would show you her back, and march downstairs. Then Clara, the  coloured maid, would escort you up the carpeted ladder that served  for the fourth flight, and show you the Skylight Room. It occupied  7x8 feet of floor space at the middle of the hall. On each side of  it was a dark lumber closet or storeroom.<br><br>    In it was an iron cot, a washstand and a chair. A shelf was the  dresser. Its four bare walls seemed to close in upon you like the  sides of a coffin. Your hand crept to your throat, you gasped, you  looked up as from a well--and breathed once more. Through the glass  of the little skylight you saw a square of blue infinity.<br><br>    ""Two dollars, suh,"" Clara would say in her half-contemptuous, half-  Tuskegeenial tones.<br><br>    One day Miss Leeson came hunting for a room. She carried a  typewriter made to be lugged around by a much larger lady. She was  a very little girl, with eyes and hair that had kept on growing after  she had stopped and that always looked as if they were saying:  ""Goodness me ! Why didn't you keep up with us?""<br><br>    Mrs. Parker showed her the double parlours. ""In this closet,"" she  said, ""one could keep a skeleton or anaesthetic or coal ""<br><br>    ""But I am neither a doctor nor a dentist,"" said Miss Leeson, with  a shiver.<br><br>    Mrs. Parker gave her the incredulous, pitying, sneering, icy stare  that she kept for those who failed to qualify as doctors or dentists,  and led the way to the second floor back.<br><br>    ""Eight dollars?"" said Miss Leeson. ""Dear me! I'm not Hetty if I do  look green. I'm just a poor little working girl. Show me something  higher and lower.""<br><br>    Mr. Skidder jumped and strewed the floor with cigarette stubs at the  rap on his door.<br><br>    ""Excuse me, Mr. Skidder,"" said Mrs. Parker, with her demon's smile at  his pale looks. ""I didn't know you were in. I asked the lady to  have a look at your lambrequins.""<br><br>    ""They're too lovely for anything,"" said Miss Leeson, smiling in  exactly the way the angels do.<br><br>    After they had gone Mr. Skidder got very busy erasing the tall,  black-haired heroine from his latest (unproduced) play and inserting  a small, roguish one with heavy, bright hair and vivacious features.<br><br>    ""Anna Held'll jump at it,"" said Mr. Skidder to himself, putting his  feet up against the lambrequins and disappearing in a cloud of smoke  like an aerial cuttlefish.<br><br>    Presently the tocsin call of ""Clara!"" sounded to the world the state  of Miss Leeson's purse. A dark goblin seized her, mounted a Stygian  stairway, thrust her into a vault with a glimmer of light in its top  and muttered the menacing and cabalistic words ""Two dollars!""<br><br>    ""I'll take it!"" sighed Miss Leeson, sinking down upon the squeaky  iron bed.<br><br>    Every day Miss Leeson went out to work. At night she brought home  papers with handwriting on them and made copies with her typewriter.  Sometimes she had no work at night, and then she would sit on the  steps of the high stoop with the other roomers. Miss Leeson was not  intended for a sky-light room when the plans were drawn for her  creation. She was gay-hearted and full of tender, whimsical fancies.  Once she let Mr. Skidder read to her three acts of his great  (unpublished) comedy, ""It's No Kid; or, The Heir of the Subway.""<br><br>    There was rejoicing among the gentlemen roomers whenever Miss Leeson  had time to sit on the steps for an hour or two. But Miss  Longnecker, the tall blonde who taught in a public school and said,  ""Well, really!"" to everything you said, sat on the top step and  sniffed. And Miss Dorn, who shot at the moving ducks at Coney every  Sunday and worked in a department store, sat on the bottom step and  sniffed. Miss Leeson sat on the middle step and the men would  quickly group around her.<br><br>    Especially Mr. Skidder, who had cast her in his mind for the star  part in a private, romantic (unspoken) drama in real life. And  especially Mr. Hoover, who was forty-five, fat, flush and foolish.  And especially very young Mr. Evans, who set up a hollow cough to  induce her to ask him to leave off cigarettes. The men voted her  ""the funniest and jolliest ever,"" but the sniffs on the top step and  the lower step were implacable.<br><br>    * * * * * *<br><br>    I pray you let the drama halt while Chorus stalks to the footlights  and drops an epicedian tear upon the fatness of Mr. Hoover. Tune the  pipes to the tragedy of tallow, the bane of bulk, the calamity of  corpulence. Tried out, Falstaff might have rendered more romance to  the ton than would have Romeo's rickety ribs to the ounce. A lover  may sigh, but he must not puff. To the train of Momus are the fat  men remanded. In vain beats the faithfullest heart above a 52-inch  belt. Avaunt, Hoover! Hoover, forty-five, flush and foolish, might  carry off Helen herself; Hoover, forty-five, flush, foolish and fat  is meat for perdition. There was never a chance for you, Hoover.<br><br>    As Mrs. Parker's roomers sat thus one summer's evening, Miss Leeson  looked up into the firmament and cried with her little gay laugh:<br><br>    ""Why, there's Billy Jackson! I can see him from down here, too.""<br><br>    All looked up--some at the windows of skyscrapers, some casting about  for an airship, Jackson-guided.<br><br>    ""It's that star,"" explained Miss Leeson, pointing with a tiny finger.  ""Not the big one that twinkles--the steady blue one near it. I can  see it every night through my skylight. I named it Billy Jackson.""<br><br>    ""Well, really!"" said Miss Longnecker. ""I didn't know you were an  astronomer, Miss Leeson.""<br><br>    ""Oh, yes,"" said the small star gazer, ""I know as much as any of them  about the style of sleeves they're going to wear next fall in Mars.""<br><br>    ""Well, really!"" said Miss Longnecker. ""The star you refer to is  Gamma, of the constellation Cassiopeia. It is nearly of the second  magnitude, and its meridian passage is--""<br><br>    ""Oh,"" said the very young Mr. Evans, ""I think Billy Jackson is a much  better name for it.""<br><br>    ""Same here,"" said Mr. Hoover, loudly breathing defiance to Miss  Longnecker. ""I think Miss Leeson has just as much right to name  stars as any of those old astrologers had.""<br><br>    ""Well, really!"" said Miss Longnecker.<br><br>    ""I wonder whether it's a shooting star,"" remarked Miss Dorn. ""I hit  nine ducks and a rabbit out of ten in the gallery at Coney Sunday.""<br><br>    ""He doesn't show up very well from down here,"" said Miss Leeson.  ""You ought to see him from my room. You know you can see stars even  in the daytime from the bottom of a well. At night my room is like  the shaft of a coal mine, and it makes Billy Jackson look like the  big diamond pin that Night fastens her kimono with.""<br><br>    There came a time after that when Miss Leeson brought no formidable  papers home to copy. And when she went out in the morning, instead  of working, she went from office to office and let her heart melt  away in the drip of cold refusals transmitted through insolent office  boys. This went on.<br><br>    There came an evening when she wearily climbed Mrs. Parker's stoop at  the hour when she always returned from her dinner at the restaurant.  But she had had no dinner.<br><br>    As she stepped into the hall Mr. Hoover met her and seized his  chance. He asked her to marry him, and his fatness hovered above her  like an avalanche. She dodged, and caught the balustrade. He tried  for her hand, and she raised it and smote him weakly in the face.  Step by step she went up, dragging herself by the railing. She  passed Mr. Skidder's door as he was red-inking a stage direction for  Myrtle Delorme (Miss Leeson) in his (unaccepted) comedy, to  ""pirouette across stage from L to the side of the Count."" Up the  carpeted ladder she crawled at last and opened the door of the  skylight room.<br><br>    She was too weak to light the lamp or to undress. She fell upon the  iron cot, her fragile body scarcely hollowing the worn springs. And  in that Erebus of the skylight room, she slowly raised her heavy  eyelids, and smiled.<br><br>    For Billy Jackson was shining down on her, calm and bright and  constant through the skylight. There was no world about her. She  was sunk in a pit of blackness, with but that small square of pallid  light framing the star that she had so whimsically and oh, so  ineffectually named. Miss Longnecker must be right; it was Gamma,  of the constellation Cassiopeia, and not Billy Jackson. And yet she  could not let it be Gamma.<br><br>    As she lay on her back she tried twice to raise her arm. The third  time she got two thin fingers to her lips and blew a kiss out of the  black pit to Billy Jackson. Her arm fell back limply.<br><br>    ""Good-bye, Billy,"" she murmured faintly. ""You're millions of miles  away and you won't even twinkle once. But you kept where I could see  you most of the time up there when there wasn't anything else but  darkness to look at, didn't you? . . . Millions of miles. . . .  Good-bye, Billy Jackson.""<br><br>    Clara, the coloured maid, found the door locked at 10 the next day,  and they forced it open. Vinegar, and the slapping of wrists and  burnt feathers proving of no avail, some one ran to 'phone for an  ambulance.<br><br>    In due time it backed up to the door with much gong-clanging, and the  capable young medico, in his white linen coat, ready, active,  confident, with his smooth face half debonair, half grim, danced up  the steps.<br><br>    ""Ambulance call to 49,"" he said briefly. ""What's the trouble?""<br><br>    ""Oh, yes, doctor,"" sniffed Mrs. Parker, as though her trouble that  there should be trouble in the house was the greater. ""I can't think  what can be the matter with her. Nothing we could do would bring her  to. It's a young woman, a Miss Elsie--yes, a Miss Elsie Leeson.  Never before in my house--""<br><br>    ""What room?"" cried the doctor in a terrible voice, to which Mrs.  Parker was a stranger.<br><br>    ""The skylight room. It--<br><br>    Evidently the ambulance doctor was familiar with the location of  skylight rooms. He was gone up the stairs, four at a time. Mrs.  Parker followed slowly, as her dignity demanded.<br><br>    On the first landing she met him coming back bearing the astronomer  in his arms. He stopped and let loose the practised scalpel of his  tongue, not loudly. Gradually Mrs. Parker crumpled as a stiff  garment that slips down from a nail. Ever afterward there remained  crumples in her mind and body. Sometimes her curious roomers would  ask her what the doctor said to her.<br><br>    ""Let that be,"" she would answer. ""If I can get forgiveness for  having heard it I will be satisfied.""<br><br>    The ambulance physician strode with his burden through the pack of  hounds that follow the curiosity chase, and even they fell back along  the sidewalk abashed, for his face was that of one who bears his own  dead.<br><br>    They noticed that he did not lay down upon the bed prepared for it in  the ambulance the form that he carried, and all that he said was:  ""Drive like h**l, Wilson,"" to the driver.<br><br>    That is all. Is it a story? In the next morning's paper I saw a  little news item, and the last sentence of it may help you (as it  helped me) to weld the incidents together.<br><br>    It recounted the reception into Bellevue Hospital of a young woman  who had been removed from No. 49 East -- street, suffering from  debility induced by starvation. It concluded with these words:<br><br>    ""Dr. William Jackson, the ambulance physician who attended the case,  says the patient will recover.""<br><br>"
13,A Horseman In The Sky - By Ambrose Bierce,"  One sunny afternoon in the autumn of the year 1861 a soldier lay in a  clump of laurel by the side of a road in western Virginia. He lay at  full length upon his stomach, his feet resting upon the toes, his head  upon the left forearm. His extended right hand loosely grasped his  rifle. But for the somewhat methodical disposition of his limbs and a  slight rhythmic movement of the cartridge-box at the back of his belt he  might have been thought to be dead. He was asleep at his post of duty.  But if detected he would be dead shortly afterward, death being the just  and legal penalty of his crime.  <br><br>  The clump of laurel in which the criminal lay was in the angle of a road  which after ascending southward a steep acclivity to that point turned  sharply to the west, running along the summit for perhaps one hundred  yards. There it turned southward again and went zigzagging downward  through the forest. At the salient of that second angle was a large flat  rock, jutting out northward, overlooking the deep valley from which the  road ascended. The rock capped a high cliff; a stone dropped from its  outer edge would have fallen sheer downward one thousand feet to the  tops of the pines. The angle where the soldier lay was on another spur  of the same cliff. Had he been awake he would have commanded a view, not  only of the short arm of the road and the jutting rock, but of the  entire profile of the cliff below it. It might well have made him giddy  to look.  <br><br>  The country was wooded everywhere except at the bottom of the valley to  the northward, where there was a small natural meadow, through which  flowed a stream scarcely visible from the valley's rim. This open ground  looked hardly larger than an ordinary door-yard, but was really several  acres in extent. Its green was more vivid than that of the inclosing  forest. Away beyond it rose a line of giant cliffs similar to those upon  which we are supposed to stand in our survey of the savage scene, and  through which the road had somehow made its climb to the summit. The  configuration of the valley, indeed, was such that from this point of  observation it seemed entirely shut in, and one could but have wondered  how the road which found a way out of it had found a way into it, and  whence came and whither went the waters of the stream that parted the  meadow more than a thousand feet below.  <br><br>  No country is so wild and difficult but men will make it a theatre of  war; concealed in the forest at the bottom of that military rat-trap, in  which half a hundred men in possession of the exits might have starved  an army to submission, lay five regiments of Federal infantry. They had  marched all the previous day and night and were resting. At nightfall  they would take to the road again, climb to the place where their  unfaithful sentinel now slept, and descending the other slope of the  ridge fall upon a camp of the enemy at about midnight. Their hope was to  surprise it, for the road led to the rear of it. In case of failure,  their position would be perilous in the extreme; and fail they surely  would should accident or vigilance apprise the enemy of the movement.  <br><br>  <b>II</b>  <br><br>  The sleeping sentinel in the clump of laurel was a young Virginian named  Carter Druse. He was the son of wealthy parents, an only child, and had  known such ease and cultivation and high living as wealth and taste were  able to command in the mountain country of western Virginia. His home  was but a few miles from where he now lay. One morning he had risen from  the breakfast-table and said, quietly but gravely: ""Father, a Union  regiment has arrived at Grafton. I am going to join it.""  <br><br>  The father lifted his leonine head, looked at the son a moment in  silence, and replied: ""Well, go, sir, and whatever may occur do what you  conceive to be your duty. Virginia, to which you are a traitor, must get  on without you. Should we both live to the end of the war, we will speak  further of the matter. Your mother, as the physician has informed you,  is in a most critical condition; at the best she cannot be with us  longer than a few weeks, but that time is precious. It would be better  not to disturb her.""  <br><br>  So Carter Druse, bowing reverently to his father, who returned the  salute with a stately courtesy that masked a breaking heart, left the  home of his childhood to go soldiering. By conscience and courage, by  deeds of devotion and daring, he soon commended himself to his fellows  and his officers; and it was to these qualities and to some knowledge of  the country that he owed his selection for his present perilous duty at  the extreme outpost. Nevertheless, fatigue had been stronger than  resolution and he had fallen asleep. What good or bad angel came in a  dream to rouse him from his state of crime, who shall say? Without a  movement, without a sound, in the profound silence and the languor of  the late afternoon, some invisible messenger of fate touched with  unsealing finger the eyes of his consciousness--whispered into the ear  of his spirit the mysterious awakening word which no human lips ever  have spoken, no human memory ever has recalled. He quietly raised his  forehead from his arm and looked between the masking stems of the  laurels, instinctively closing his right hand about the stock of his  rifle.  <br><br>  His first feeling was a keen artistic delight. On a colossal pedestal,  the cliff,--motionless at the extreme edge of the capping rock and  sharply outlined against the sky,--was an equestrian statue of  impressive dignity. The figure of the man sat the figure of the horse,  straight and soldierly, but with the repose of a Grecian god carved in  the marble which limits the suggestion of activity. The gray costume  harmonized with its arial background; the metal of accoutrement and  caparison was softened and subdued by the shadow; the animal's skin had  no points of high light. A carbine strikingly foreshortened lay across  the pommel of the saddle, kept in place by the right hand grasping it at  the ""grip""; the left hand, holding the bridle rein, was invisible. In  silhouette against the sky the profile of the horse was cut with the  sharpness of a cameo; it looked across the heights of air to the  confronting cliffs beyond. The face of the rider, turned slightly away,  showed only an outline of temple and beard; he was looking downward to  the bottom of the valley. Magnified by its lift against the sky and by  the soldier's testifying sense of the formidableness of a near enemy the  group appeared of heroic, almost colossal, size.  <br><br>  For an instant Druse had a strange, half-defined feeling that he had  slept to the end of the war and was looking upon a noble work of art  reared upon that eminence to commemorate the deeds of an heroic past of  which he had been an inglorious part. The feeling was dispelled by a  slight movement of the group: the horse, without moving its feet, had  drawn its body slightly backward from the verge; the man remained  immobile as before. Broad awake and keenly alive to the significance of  the situation, Druse now brought the butt of his rifle against his cheek  by cautiously pushing the barrel forward through the bushes, cocked the  piece, and glancing through the sights covered a vital spot of the  horseman's breast. A touch upon the trigger and all would have been well  with Carter Druse. At that instant the horseman turned his head and  looked in the direction of his concealed foeman--seemed to look into his  very face, into his eyes, into his brave, compassionate heart.  <br><br>  Is it then so terrible to kill an enemy in war--an enemy who has  surprised a secret vital to the safety of one's self and comrades--an  enemy more formidable for his knowledge than all his army for its  numbers? Carter Druse grew pale; he shook in every limb, turned faint,  and saw the statuesque group before him as black figures, rising,  falling, moving unsteadily in arcs of circles in a fiery sky. His hand  fell away from his weapon, his head slowly dropped until his face rested  on the leaves in which he lay. This courageous gentleman and hardy  soldier was near swooning from intensity of emotion.  <br><br>  It was not for long; in another moment his face was raised from earth,  his hands resumed their places on the rifle, his forefinger sought the  trigger; mind, heart, and eyes were clear, conscience and reason sound.  He could not hope to capture that enemy; to alarm him would but send him  dashing to his camp with his fatal news. The duty of the soldier was  plain: the man must be shot dead from ambush--without warning, without a  moment's spiritual preparation, with never so much as an unspoken  prayer, he must be sent to his account. But no--there is a hope; he may  have discovered nothing--perhaps he is but admiring the sublimity of the  landscape. If permitted, he may turn and ride carelessly away in the  direction whence he came. Surely it will be possible to judge at the  instant of his withdrawing whether he knows. It may well be that his  fixity of attention--Druse turned his head and looked through the deeps  of air downward, as from the surface to the bottom of a translucent sea.  He saw creeping across the green meadow a sinuous line of figures of men  and horses--some foolish commander was permitting the soldiers of his  escort to water their beasts in the open, in plain view from a dozen  summits!  <br><br>  Druse withdrew his eyes from the valley and fixed them again upon the  group of man and horse in the sky, and again it was through the sights  of his rifle. But this time his aim was at the horse. In his memory, as  if they were a divine mandate, rang the words of his father at their  parting: ""Whatever may occur, do what you conceive to be your duty."" He  was calm now. His teeth were firmly but not rigidly closed; his nerves  were as tranquil as a sleeping babe's--not a tremor affected any muscle  of his body; his breathing, until suspended in the act of taking aim,  was regular and slow. Duty had conquered; the spirit had said to the  body: ""Peace, be still."" He fired.  <br><br>  <b>III</b>  <br><br>  An officer of the Federal force, who in a spirit of adventure or in  quest of knowledge had left the hidden <em>bivouac</em> in the valley, and with  aimless feet had made his way to the lower edge of a small open space  near the foot of the cliff, was considering what he had to gain by  pushing his exploration further. At a distance of a quarter-mile before  him, but apparently at a stone's throw, rose from its fringe of pines  the gigantic face of rock, towering to so great a height above him that  it made him giddy to look up to where its edge cut a sharp, rugged line  against the sky. It presented a clean, vertical profile against a  background of blue sky to a point half the way down, and of distant  hills, hardly less blue, thence to the tops of the trees at its base.  Lifting his eyes to the dizzy altitude of its summit the officer saw an  astonishing sight--a man on horseback riding down into the valley  through the air!  <br><br>  Straight upright sat the rider, in military fashion, with a firm seat in  the saddle, a strong clutch upon the rein to hold his charger from too  impetuous a plunge. From his bare head his long hair streamed upward,  waving like a plume. His hands were concealed in the cloud of the  horse's lifted mane. The animal's body was as level as if every  hoof-stroke encountered the resistant earth. Its motions were those of a  wild gallop, but even as the officer looked they ceased, with all the  legs thrown sharply forward as in the act of alighting from a leap. But  this was a flight!  <br><br>  Filled with amazement and terror by this apparition of a horseman in the  sky--half believing himself the chosen scribe of some new Apocalypse,  the officer was overcome by the intensity of his emotions; his legs  failed him and he fell. Almost at the same instant he heard a crashing  sound in the trees--a sound that died without an echo--and all was  still.  <br><br>  The officer rose to his feet, trembling. The familiar sensation of an  abraded shin recalled his dazed faculties. Pulling himself together he  ran rapidly obliquely away from the cliff to a point distant from its  foot; thereabout he expected to find his man; and thereabout he  naturally failed. In the fleeting instant of his vision his imagination  had been so wrought upon by the apparent grace and ease and intention of  the marvelous performance that it did not occur to him that the line of  march of arial cavalry is directly downward, and that he could find the  objects of his search at the very foot of the cliff. A half-hour later  he returned to camp.  <br><br>  This officer was a wise man; he knew better than to tell an incredible  truth. He said nothing of what he had seen. But when the commander asked  him if in his scout he had learned anything of advantage to the  expedition he answered:  <br><br>  ""Yes, sir; there is no road leading down into this valley from the  southward.""  <br><br>  The commander, knowing better, smiled.  <br><br>  <b>IV</b>  <br><br>  After firing his shot, Private Carter Druse reloaded his rifle and  resumed his watch. Ten minutes had hardly passed when a Federal sergeant  crept cautiously to him on hands and knees. Druse neither turned his  head nor looked at him, but lay without motion or sign of recognition.  <br><br>  ""Did you fire?"" the sergeant whispered.  <br><br>  ""Yes.""  <br><br>  ""At what?""  <br><br>  ""A horse. It was standing on yonder rock--pretty far out. You see it is  no longer there. It went over the cliff.""  <br><br>  The man's face was white, but he showed no other sign of emotion. Having  answered, he turned away his eyes and said no more. The sergeant did not  understand.  <br><br>  ""See here, Druse,"" he said, after a moment's silence, ""it's no use  making a mystery. I order you to report. Was there anybody on the  horse?""  <br><br>  ""Yes.""  <br><br>  ""Well?""  <br><br>  ""My father.""  <br><br>  The sergeant rose to his feet and walked away. ""Good God!"" he said.                             <br><br>"
14,The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow - By Washington Irving,"Found among the papers of the late Diedrech Knickerbocker.  <br><br>  <i>A pleasing land of drowsy head it was,<br> Of dreams that wave before the half-shut eye;<br> And of gay castles in the clouds that pass, <br>Forever flushing round a summer sky. <p><b>- Castle of Indolence.</b><p></i>  <br><br><b>- Castle of Indolence.</b><br><br>  In the bosom of one of those spacious coves which indent the eastern shore of the Hudson, at that broad expansion of the river denominated by the ancient Dutch navigators the Tappan Zee, and where they always prudently shortened sail and implored the protection of St. Nicholas when they crossed, there lies a small market town or rural port, which by some is called Greensburgh, but which is more generally and properly known by the name of Tarry Town. This name was given, we are told, in former days, by the good housewives of the adjacent country, from the inveterate propensity of their husbands to linger about the village tavern on market days. Be that as it may, I do not vouch for the fact, but merely advert to it, for the sake of being precise and authentic. Not far from this village, perhaps about two miles, there is a little valley or rather lap of land among high hills, which is one of the quietest places in the whole world. A small brook glides through it, with just murmur enough to lull one to repose; and the occasional whistle of a quail or tapping of a woodpecker is almost the only sound that ever breaks in upon the uniform tranquillity.  <br><br>  I recollect that, when a stripling, my first exploit in squirrel-shooting was in a grove of tall walnut-trees that shades one side of the valley. I had wandered into it at noontime, when all nature is peculiarly quiet, and was startled by the roar of my own gun, as it broke the Sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes. If ever I should wish for a retreat whither I might steal from the world and its distractions, and dream quietly away the remnant of a troubled life, I know of none more promising than this little valley.  <br><br>  From the listless repose of the place, and the peculiar character of its inhabitants, who are descendants from the original Dutch settlers, this sequestered glen has long been known by the name of SLEEPY HOLLOW, and its rustic lads are called the Sleepy Hollow Boys throughout all the neighboring country. A drowsy, dreamy influence seems to hang over the land, and to pervade the very atmosphere. Some say that the place was bewitched by a High German doctor, during the early days of the settlement; others, that an old Indian chief, the prophet or wizard of his tribe, held his powwows there before the country was discovered by Master Hendrick Hudson. Certain it is, the place still continues under the sway of some witching power, that holds a spell over the minds of the good people, causing them to walk in a continual reverie. They are given to all kinds of marvelous beliefs; are subject to trances and visions, and frequently see strange sights, and hear music and voices in the air. The whole neighborhood abounds with local tales, haunted spots, and twilight superstitions; stars shoot and meteors glare oftener across the valley than in any other part of the country, and the nightmare, with her whole ninefold, seems to make it the favorite scene of her gambols.  <br><br>  The dominant spirit, however, that haunts this enchanted region, and seems to be commander-in-chief of all the powers of the air, is the apparition of a figure on horseback, without a head. It is said by some to be the ghost of a Hessian trooper, whose head had been carried away by a cannon-ball, in some nameless battle during the Revolutionary War, and who is ever and anon seen by the country folk hurrying along in the gloom of night, as if on the wings of the wind. His haunts are not confined to the valley, but extend at times to the adjacent roads, and especially to the vicinity of a church at no great distance. Indeed, certain of the most authentic historians of those parts, who have been careful in collecting and collating the floating facts concerning this spectre, allege that the body of the trooper having been buried in the churchyard, the ghost rides forth to the scene of battle in nightly quest of his head, and that the rushing speed with which he sometimes passes along the Hollow, like a midnight blast, is owing to his being belated, and in a hurry to get back to the churchyard before daybreak.  <br><br>  Such is the general purport of this legendary superstition, which has furnished materials for many a wild story in that region of shadows; and the spectre is known at all the country firesides, by the name of the Headless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow.  <br><br>  It is remarkable that the visionary propensity I have mentioned is not confined to the native inhabitants of the valley, but is unconsciously imbibed by every one who resides there for a time. However wide awake they may have been before they entered that sleepy region, they are sure, in a little time, to inhale the witching influence of the air, and begin to grow imaginative, to dream dreams, and see apparitions.  <br><br>  I mention this peaceful spot with all possible laud for it is in such little retired Dutch valleys, found here and there embosomed in the great State of New York, that population, manners, and customs remain fixed, while the great torrent of migration and improvement, which is making such incessant changes in other parts of this restless country, sweeps by them unobserved. They are like those little nooks of still water, which border a rapid stream, where we may see the straw and  <br><br>  bubble riding quietly at anchor, or slowly revolving in their mimic harbor, undisturbed by the rush of the passing current. Though many years have elapsed since I trod the drowsy shades of Sleepy Hollow, yet I question whether I should not still find the same trees and the same families vegetating in its sheltered bosom.  <br><br>  In this by-place of nature there abode, in a remote period of American history, that is to say, some thirty years since, a worthy wight of the name of Ichabod Crane, who sojourned, or, as he expressed it, ""tarried,"" in Sleepy Hollow, for the purpose of instructing the children of the vicinity. He was a native of Connecticut, a State which supplies the Union with pioneers for the mind as well as for the forest, and sends forth yearly its legions of frontier woodmen and country schoolmasters. The cognomen of Crane was not inapplicable to his person. He was tall, but exceedingly lank, with narrow shoulders, long arms and legs, hands that dangled a mile out of his sleeves, feet that might have served for shovels, and his whole frame most loosely hung together. His head was small, and flat at top, with huge ears, large green glassy eyes, and a long snipe nose, so that it looked like a weather-cock perched upon his spindle neck to tell which way the wind blew. To see him striding along the profile of a hill on a windy day, with his clothes bagging and fluttering about him, one might have mistaken him for the genius of famine descending upon the earth, or some scarecrow eloped from a cornfield.  <br><br>  His schoolhouse was a low building of one large room, rudely constructed of logs; the windows partly glazed, and partly patched with leaves of old copybooks. It was most ingeniously secured at vacant hours, by a *withe twisted in the handle of the door, and stakes set against the window shutters; so that though a thief might get in with perfect ease, he would find some embarrassment in getting out, --an idea most probably borrowed by the architect, Yost Van Houten, from the mystery of an eelpot. The schoolhouse stood in a rather lonely but pleasant situation, just at the foot of a woody hill, with a brook running close by, and a formidable birch-tree growing at one end of it. From hence the low murmur of his pupils' voices, conning over their lessons, might be heard in a drowsy summer's day, like the hum of a beehive; interrupted now and then by the authoritative voice of the master, in the tone of menace or command, or, peradventure, by the appalling sound of the birch, as he urged some tardy loiterer along the flowery path of knowledge. Truth to say, he was a conscientious man, and ever bore in mind the golden maxim, ""Spare the rod and spoil the child."" Ichabod Crane's scholars certainly were not spoiled.  <br><br>  I would not have it imagined, however, that he was one of those cruel potentates of the school who joy in the smart of their subjects; on the contrary, he administered justice with discrimination rather than severity; taking the burden off the backs of the weak, and laying it on those of the strong. Your mere puny stripling, that winced at the least flourish of the rod, was passed by with indulgence; but the claims of justice were satisfied by inflicting a double portion on some little tough wrong headed, broad-skirted Dutch urchin, who sulked and swelled and grew dogged and sullen beneath the birch. All this he called ""doing his duty by their parents;"" and he never inflicted a chastisement without following it by the assurance, so consolatory to the smarting urchin, that ""he would remember it and thank him for it the longest day he had to live.""  <br><br>  When school hours were over, he was even the companion and playmate of the larger boys; and on holiday afternoons would convoy some of the smaller ones home, who happened to have pretty sisters, or good housewives for mothers, noted for the comforts of the cupboard. Indeed, it behooved him to keep on good terms with his pupils. The revenue arising from his school was small, and would have been scarcely sufficient to furnish him with daily bread, for he was a huge feeder, and, though lank, had the dilating powers of an anaconda; but to help out his maintenance, he was, according to country custom in those parts, boarded and lodged at the houses of the farmers whose children he instructed. With these he lived successively a week at a time, thus going the rounds of the neighborhood, with all his worldly effects tied up in a cotton handkerchief.  <br><br>  That all this might not be too onerous on the purses of his rustic patrons, who are apt to considered the costs of schooling a grievous burden, and schoolmasters as mere drones he had various ways of rendering himself both useful and agreeable. He assisted the farmers occasionally in the lighter labors of their farms, helped to make hay, mended the fences, took the horses to water, drove the cows from pasture, and cut wood for the winter fire. He laid aside, too, all the dominant dignity and absolute sway with which he lorded it in his little empire, the school, and became wonderfully gentle and ingratiating. He found favor in the eyes of the mothers by petting the children, particularly the youngest; and like the lion bold, which whilom so magnanimously the lamb did hold, he would sit with a child on one knee, and rock a cradle with his foot for whole hours together.  <br><br>  In addition to his other vocations, he was the singing- master of the neighborhood, and picked up many bright shillings by instructing the young folks in psalmody. It was a matter of no little vanity to him on Sundays, to take his station in front of the church gallery, with a band of chosen singers; where, in his own mind, he completely carried away the palm from the parson. Certain it is, his voice resounded far above all the rest of the congregation; and there are peculiar quavers still to be heard in that church, and which may even be heard half a mile off, quite to the opposite side of the mill-pond, on a still Sunday morning, which are said to be legitimately descended from the nose of Ichabod Crane. Thus, by divers little makeshifts, in that ingenious way which is commonly denominated ""by hook and by crook,"" the worthy pedagogue got on tolerably enough, and was thought, by all who understood nothing of the labor of headwork, to have a wonderfully easy life of it.  <br><br>  The schoolmaster is generally a man of some importance in the female circle of a rural neighborhood; being considered a kind of idle, gentlemanlike personage, of vastly superior taste and accomplishments to the rough country swains, and, indeed, inferior in learning only to the parson. His appearance, therefore, is apt to occasion some little stir at the tea-table of a farmhouse, and the addition of a supernumerary dish of cakes or sweetmeats, or, peradventure, the parade of a silver teapot. Our man of letters, therefore, was peculiarly happy in the smiles of all the country damsels. How he would figure among them in the churchyard, between services on Sundays; gathering grapes for them from the wild vines that overran the surrounding trees; reciting for their amusement all the epitaphs on the tombstones; or sauntering, with a whole bevy of them, along the banks of the adjacent mill-pond; while the more bashful country bumpkins hung sheepishly back, envying his superior elegance and address.  <br><br>  From his half-itinerant life, also, he was a kind of traveling gazette, carrying the whole budget of local gossip from house to house, so that his appearance was always greeted with satisfaction. He was, moreover, esteemed by the women as a man of great erudition, for he had read several books quite through, and was a perfect master of Cotton Mather's ""History of New England Witchcraft,"" in which, by the way, he most firmly and potently believed.  <br><br>  He was, in fact, an odd mixture of small shrewdness and simple credulity. His appetite for the marvelous, and his powers of digesting it, were equally extraordinary; and both had been increased by his residence in this spell-bound region. No tale was too gross or monstrous for his capacious swallow. It was often his delight, after his school was dismissed in the afternoon, to stretch himself on the rich bed of clover bordering the little brook that whimpered by his school-house, and there con over old Mather's direful tales, until the gathering dusk of evening made the printed page a mere mist before his eyes. Then, as he wended his way by swamp and stream and awful woodland, to the farmhouse where he happened to be quartered, every sound of nature, at that witching hour, fluttered his excited imagination, --the moan of the whip-poor-will from the hillside, the boding cry of the tree toad, that harbinger of storm, the dreary hooting of the screech owl, to the sudden rustling in the thicket of birds frightened from their roost. The fireflies, too, which sparkled most vividly in the darkest places, now and then startled him, as one of uncommon brightness would stream across his path; and if, by chance, a huge blockhead of a beetle came winging his blundering flight against him, the poor varlet was ready to give up the ghost, with the idea that he was struck with a witch's token. His only resource on such occasions, either to drown thought or drive away evil spirits, was to sing psalm tunes and the good people of Sleepy Hollow, as they sat by their doors of an evening, were often filled with awe at hearing his nasal melody, ""in linked sweetness long drawn out,"" floating from the distant hill, or along the dusky road.  <br><br>  Another of his sources of fearful pleasure was to pass long winter evenings with the old Dutch wives, as they sat spinning by the fire, with a row of apples roasting and spluttering along the hearth, and listen to their marvellous tales of ghosts and goblins, and haunted fields, and haunted brooks, and haunted bridges, and haunted houses, and particularly of the headless horseman, or Galloping Hessian of the Hollow, as they sometimes called him. He would delight them equally by his anecdotes of witchcraft, and of the direful omens and portentous sights and sounds in the air, which prevailed in the earlier times of Connecticut; and would frighten them woefully with speculations upon comets and shooting stars; and with the alarming fact that the world did absolutely turn round, and that they were half the time topsy-turvy!  <br><br>  But if there was a pleasure in all this, while snugly cuddling in the chimney corner of a chamber that was all of a ruddy glow from the crackling wood fire, and where, of course, no spectre dared to show its face, it was dearly purchased by the terrors of his subsequent walk homewards. What fearful shapes and shadows beset his path, amidst the dim and ghastly glare of a snowy night! With what wistful look did he eye every trembling ray of light streaming across the waste fields from some distant window! How often was he appalled by some shrub covered with snow, which, like a sheeted spectre, beset his very path! How often did he shrink with curdling awe at the sound of his own steps on the frosty crust beneath his feet; and dread to look over his shoulder, lest he should behold some uncouth being tramping close behind him! and how often was he thrown into complete dismay by some rushing blast, howling among the trees, in the idea that it was the Galloping Hessian on one of his nightly scourings!  <br><br>  All these, however, were mere terrors of the night, phantoms of the mind that walk in darkness; and though he had seen many spectres in his time, and been more than once beset by Satan in divers shapes, in his lonely perambulations, yet daylight put an end to all these evils; and he would have passed a pleasant life of it, in despite of the Devil and all his works, if his path had not been crossed by a being that causes more perplexity to mortal man than ghosts, goblins, and the whole race of witches put together, and that was--a woman.  <br><br>  Among the musical disciples who assembled, one evening in each week, to receive his instructions in psalmody, was Katrina Van Tassel, the daughter and only child of a substantial Dutch farmer. She was a booming lass of fresh eighteen; plump as a partridge; ripe and melting and rosy-cheeked as one of her father's peaches, and universally famed, not merely for her beauty, but her vast expectations. She was withal a little of a coquette, as might be perceived even in her dress, which was a mixture of ancient and modern fashions, as most suited to set of her charms. She wore the ornaments of pure yellow gold, which her great-great-grandmother had brought over from Saar dam; the tempting stomacher of the olden time, and withal a provokingly short petticoat, to display the prettiest foot and ankle in the country round.  <br><br>  Ichahod Crane had a soft and foolish heart towards the sex; and it is not to be wondered at, that so tempting a morsel soon found favor in his eyes, more especially after he had visited her in her paternal mansion. Old Baltus Van Tassel was a perfect picture of a thriving, contented, liberal-hearted farmer. He seldom, it is true, sent either his eyes or his thoughts beyond the boundaries of his own farm; but within those everything was snug, happy and well-conditioned. He was satisfied with his wealth, but not proud of it; and piqued himself upon the hearty abundance, rather than the style in which he lived. His stronghold was situated on the banks of the Hudson, in one of those green, sheltered, fertile nooks in which the Dutch farmers are so fond of nestling. A great elm tree spread its broad branches over it, at the foot of which bubbled up a spring of the softest and sweetest water, in a little well formed of a barrel; and then stole sparkling away through the grass, to a neighboring brook, that babbled along among alders and dwarf willows. Hard by the farmhouse was a vast barn, that might have served for a church; every window and crevice of which seemed bursting forth with the treasures of the farm; the flail was busily resounding within it from morning to night; swallows and martins skimmed twittering about the eaves; an rows of pigeons, some with one eye turned up, as if watching the weather, some with their heads under their wings or buried in their bosoms, and others swelling, and cooing, and bowing about their dames, were enjoying the sunshine on the roof. Sleek unwieldy porkers were grunting in the repose and abundance of their pens, from whence sallied forth, now and then, troops of sucking pigs, as if to snuff the air. A stately squadron of snowy geese were riding in an adjoining pond, convoying whole fleets of ducks; regiments of turkeys were gobbling through the farmyard, and Guinea fowls fretting about it, like ill-tempered housewives, with their peevish, discontented cry. Before the barn door strutted the gallant cock, that pattern of a husband, a warrior and a fine gentleman, clapping his burnished wings and crowing in the pride and gladness of his heart, --sometimes tearing up the earth with his feet, and then generously calling his ever-hungry family of wives and children to enjoy the rich morsel which he had discovered.  <br><br>  The pedagogue's mouth watered as he looked upon this sumptuous promise of luxurious winter fare. In his devouring mind's eye, he pictured to himself every roasting-pig running about with a pudding in his belly, and an apple in his mouth; the pigeons were snugly put to bed in a comfortable pie, and tucked in with a coverlet of crust; the geese were swimming in their own gravy; and the ducks pairing cosily in dishes, like snug married couples, with a decent competency of onion sauce. In the porkers he saw carved out the future sleek side of bacon, and juicy relishing ham; not a turkey but he beheld daintily trussed up, with its gizzard under its wing, and, peradventure, a necklace of savory sausages; and even bright chanticleer himself lay sprawling on his back, in a side dish, with uplifted claws, as if craving that quarter which his chivalrous spirit disdained to ask while living.  <br><br>  As the enraptured Ichabod fancied all this, and as he rolled his great green eyes over the fat meadow lands, the rich fields of wheat, of rye, of buckwheat, and Indian corn, and the orchards burdened with ruddy fruit, which surrounded the warm tenement of Van Tassel, his heart yearned after the damsel who was to inherit these domains, and his imagination expanded with the idea, how they might be readily turned into cash, and the money invested in immense tracts of wild land, and shingle palaces in the wilderness. Nay, his busy fancy already realized his hopes, and presented to him the blooming Katrina, with a whole family of children, mounted on the top of a wagon loaded with household trumpery, with pots and kettles dangling beneath; and he beheld himself bestriding a pacing mare, with a colt at her heels, setting out for Kentucky, Tennessee, --or the Lord knows where!  <br><br>  When he entered the house, the conquest of his heart was complete. It was one of those spacious farmhouses, with high- ridged but lowly sloping roofs, built in the style handed down from the first Dutch settlers; the low projecting eaves forming a piazza along the front, capable of being closed up in bad weather. Under this were hung flails, harness, various utensils of husbandry, and nets for fishing in the neighboring river. Benches were built along the sides for summer use; and a great spinning-wheel at one end, and a churn at the other, showed the various uses to which this important porch might be devoted. From this piazza the wondering Ichabod entered the hall, which formed the centre of the mansion, and the place of usual residence. Here rows of resplendent pewter, ranged on a long dresser, dazzled his eyes. In one corner stood a huge bag of wool, ready to be spun; in another, a quantity of linsey-woolsey just from the loom; ears of Indian corn, and strings of dried apples and peaches, hung in gay festoons along the walls, mingled with the gaud of red peppers; and a door left ajar gave him a peep into the best parlor, where the claw-footed chairs and dark mahogany tables shone like mirrors; andirons, with their accompanying shovel and tongs, glistened from their covert of asparagus tops; mock- oranges and conch - shells decorated the mantelpiece; strings of various-colored birds eggs were suspended above it; a great ostrich egg was hung from the centre of the room, and a corner cupboard, knowingly left open, displayed immense treasures of old silver and well-mended china.  <br><br>  From the moment Ichabod laid his eyes upon these regions of delight, the peace of his mind was at an end, and his only study was how to gain the affections of the peerless daughter of Van Tassel. In this enterprise, however, he had more real difficulties than generally fell to the lot of a knight-errant of yore, who seldom had anything but giants, enchanters, fiery dragons, and such like easily conquered adversaries, to contend with and had to make his way merely through gates of iron and brass, and walls of adamant to the castle keep, where the lady of his heart was confined; all which he achieved as easily as a man would carve his way to the centre of a Christmas pie; and then the lady gave him her hand as a matter of course. Ichabod, on the contrary, had to win his way to the heart of a country coquette, beset with a labyrinth of whims and caprices, which were forever presenting new difficulties and impediments; and he had to encounter a host of fearful adversaries of real flesh and blood, the numerous rustic admirers, who beset every portal to her heart, keeping a watchful and angry eye upon each other, but ready to fly out in the common cause against any new competitor.  <br><br>  Among these, the most formidable was a burly, roaring, roystering blade, of the name of Abraham, or, according to the Dutch abbreviation, Brom Van Brunt, the hero of the country round which rang with his feats of strength and hardihood. He was broad-shouldered and double-jointed, with short curly black hair, and a bluff but not unpleasant countenance, having a mingled air of fun and arrogance From his Herculean frame and great powers of limb he had received the nickname of BROM BONES, by which he was universally known. He was famed for great knowledge and skill in horsemanship, being as dexterous on horseback as a Tartar. He was foremost at all races and cock fights; and, with the ascendancy which bodily strength always acquires in rustic life, was the umpire in all disputes, setting his hat on one side, and giving his decisions with an air and tone that admitted of no gainsay or appeal. He was always ready for either a fight or a frolic; but had more mischief than ill-will in his composition; and with all his overbearing roughness, there was a strong dash of waggish good humor at bottom. He had three or four boon companions, who regarded him as their model, and at the head of whom he scoured the country, attending every scene of feud or merriment for miles round. In cold weather he was distinguished by a fur cap, surmounted with a flaunting fox's tail; and when the folks at a country gathering descried this well-known crest at a distance, whisking about among a squad of hard riders, they always stood by for a squall. Sometimes his crew would be heard dashing along past the farmhouses at midnight, with whoop and halloo, like a troop of Don Cossacks; and the old dames, startled out of their sleep, would listen for a moment till the hurry-scurry had clattered by, and then exclaim, ""Ay, there goes Brom Bones and his gang!"" The neighbors looked upon him with a mixture of awe, admiration, and good-will; and, when any madcap prank or rustic brawl occurred in the vicinity, always shook their heads, and warranted Brom Bones was at the bottom of it.  <br><br>  This rantipole hero had for some time singled out the blooming Katrina for the object of his uncouth gallantries, and though his amorous toyings were something like the gentle caresses and endearments ofa bear, yet it was whispered that she did not altogether discourage his hopes. Certain it is, his advances were signals for rival candidates to retire, who felt no inclination to cross a lion in his amours; insomuch, that when his horse was seen tied to Van Tassel's paling, on a Sunday night, a sure sign that his master was courting, or, as it is termed, "" sparking,"" within, all other suitors passed by in despair, and carried the war into other quarters.  <br><br>  Such was the formidable rival with whom Ichabod Crane had to contend, and, considering, all things, a stouter man than he would have shrunk from the competition, and a wiser man would have despaired. He had, however, a happy mixture of pliability and perseverance in his nature; he was in form and spirit like a supple-jackyielding, but tough; though he bent, he never broke; and though he bowed beneath the slightest pressure, yet, the moment it was away--jerk!--he was as erect, and carried his head as high as ever.  <br><br>  To have taken the field openly against his rival would have been madness; for he was not a man to be thwarted in his amours, any more than that stormy lover, Achilles. Ichabod, therefore, made his advances in a quiet and gently insinuating manner. Under cover of his character of singing-master, he made frequent visits at the farmhouse; not that he had anything to apprehend from the meddlesome interference of parents, which is so often a stumbling-block in the path of lovers. Balt Van Tassel was an easy indulgent soul; he loved his daughter better even than his pipe, and, like a reasonable man and an excellent father, let her have her way in everything. His notable little wife, too, had enough to do to attend to her housekeeping and manage her poultry; for, as she sagely observed, ducks and geese are foolish things, and must be looked after, but girls can take care of themselves. Thus, while the busy dame bustled about the house, or plied her spinning-wheel at one end of the piazza, honest Balt would sit smoking his evening pipe at the other, watching the achievements of a little wooden warrior, who, armed with a sword in each hand, was most valiantly fighting the wind on the pinnacle of the barn. In the mean time, Ichabod would carry on his suit with the daughter by the side of the spring under the great elm, or sauntering along in the twilight, that hour so favorable to the lover's eloquence.  <br><br>  I profess not to know how women's hearts are wooed and won. To me they have always been matters of riddle and admiration. Some seem to have but one vulnerable point, or door of access; while others have a thousand avenues, and may be captured in a thousand different ways. It is a great triumph of skill to gain the former, but a still greater proof of generalship to maintain possession of the latter, for man must battle for his fortress at every door and window. He who wins a thousand common hearts is therefore entitled to some renown; but he who keeps undisputed sway over the heart of a coquette is indeed a hero. Certain it is, this was not the case with the redoubtable Brom Bones; and from the moment Ichabod Crane made his advances, the interests of the former evidently declined: his horse was no longer seen tied to the palings on Sunday nights, and a deadly feud gradually arose between him and the preceptor of Sleepy Hollow.  <br><br>  Brom, who had a degree of rough chivalry in his nature, would fain have carried matters to open warfare and have settled their pretensions to the lady, according to the mode of those most concise and simple reasoners, the knights-errant of yore, -- by single combat; but lchabod was too conscious of the superior might of his adversary to enter the lists against him; he had overheard a boast of Bones, that he would ""double the schoolmaster up, and lay him on a shelf of his own schoolhouse;"" and he was too wary to give him an opportunity. There was something extremely provoking, in this obstinately pacific system; it left Brom no alternative but to draw upon the funds of rustic waggery in his disposition, and to play off boorish practical jokes upon his rival. Ichabod became the object of whimsical persecution to Bones and his gang of rough riders. They harried his hitherto peaceful domains, smoked out his singing- school by stopping up the chimney, broke into the schoolhouse at night, in spite of its formidable fastenings of withe and window stakes, and turned everything topsy-turvy, so that the poor schoolmaster began to think all the witches in the country held their meetings there. But what was still more annoying, Brom took all Opportunities of turning him into ridicule in presence of his mistress, and had a scoundrel dog whom he taught to whine in the most ludicrous manner, and introduced as a rival of Ichabod's, to instruct her in psalmody.  <br><br>  In this way matters went on for some time, without producing any material effect on the relative situations of the contending powers. On a fine autumnal afternoon, Ichabod, in pensive mood, sat enthroned on the lofty stool from whence he usually watched all the concerns of his little literary realm. In his hand he swayed a ferule, that sceptre of despotic power; the birch of justice reposed on three nails behind the throne, a constant terror to evil doers, while on the desk before him might be seen sundry contraband articles and prohibited weapons, detected upon the persons of idle urchins, such as half-munched apples, popguns, whirligigs, fly-cages, and whole legions of rampant little paper game-cocks. Apparently there had been some appalling act of justice recently inflicted, for his scholars were all busily intent upon their books, or slyly whispering behind them with one eye kept upon the master; and a kind of buzzing stillness reigned throughout the schoolroom. It was suddenly interrupted by the appearance of a negro in tow-cloth jacket and trowsers. a round-crowned fragment of a hat, like the cap of Mercury, and mounted on the back of a ragged, wild, half-broken colt, which he managed with a rope by way of halter. He came clattering up to the school-door with an invitation to Ichabod to attend a merry - making or ""quilting-frolic,"" to be held that evening at Mynheer Van Tassel's; and having, delivered his message with that air of importance and effort at fine language which a negro is apt to display on petty embassies of the kind, he dashed over the brook, and was seen scampering, away up the Hollow, full of the importance and hurry of his mission.  <br><br>  All was now bustle and hubbub in the late quiet schoolroom. The scholars were hurried through their lessons without stopping at trifles; those who were nimble skipped over half with impunity, and those who were tardy had a smart application now and then in the rear, to quicken their speed or help them over a tall word. Books were flung aside without being put away on the shelves, inkstands were overturned, benches thrown down, and the whole school was turned loose an hour before the usual time, bursting forth like a legion of young imps, yelping and racketing about the green in joy at their early emancipation.  <br><br>  The gallant Ichabod now spent at least an extra half hour at his toilet, brushing and furbishing up his best, and indeed only suit of rusty black, and arranging his locks by a bit of broken looking-glass that hung up in the schoolhouse. That he might make his appearance before his mistress in the true style of a cavalier, he borrowed a horse from the farmer with whom he was domiciliated, a choleric old Dutchman of the name of Hans Van Ripper, and, thus gallantly mounted, issued forth like a knight- errant in quest of adventures. But it is meet I should, in the true spirit of romantic story, give some account of the looks and equipments of my hero and his steed. The animal he bestrode was a broken-down plow-horse, that had outlived almost everything but its viciousness. He was gaunt and shagged, with a ewe neck, and a head like a hammer; his rusty mane and tail were tangled and knotted with burs; one eye had lost its pupil, and was glaring and spectral, but the other had the gleam of a genuine devil in it. Still he must have had fire and mettle in his day, if we may judge from the name he bore of Gunpowder. He had, in fact, been a favorite steed of his master's, the choleric Van Ripper, who was a furious rider, and had infused, very probably, some of his own spirit into the animal; for, old and broken-down as he looked, there was more of the lurking devil in him than in any young filly in the country.  <br><br>  Ichabod was a suitable figure for such a steed . He rode with short stirrups, which brought his knees nearly up to the pommel of the saddle; his sharp elbows stuck out like grasshoppers'; he carried his whip perpendicularly in his hand, like a sceptre, and as his horse jogged on, the motion of his arms was not unlike the flapping of a pair of wings. A small wool hat rested on the top of his nose, for so his scanty strip of forehead might be called, and the skirts of his black coat fluttered out almost to the horses tail. Such was the appearance of Ichabod and his steed as they shambled out of the gate of Hans Van Ripper, and it was altogether such an apparition as is seldom to be met with in broad daylight.  <br><br>  It was, as I have said, a fine autumnal day; the sky was clear and serene, and nature wore that rich and golden livery which we always associate with the idea of abundance. The forests had put on their sober brown and yellow, while some trees of the tenderer kind had been nipped by the frosts into brilliant dyes of orange, purple, and scarlet. Streaming files of wild ducks began to make their appearance high in the air; the bark of the squirrel might be heard from the groves of beech and hickory- nuts, and the pensive whistle of the quail at intervals from the neighboring stubble field.  <br><br>  The small birds were taking their farewell banquets. In the fullness of their revelry, they fluttered, chirping and frolicking from bush to bush, and tree to tree, capricious from the very profusion and variety around them. There was the honest cockrobin, the favorite game of stripling sportsmen, with its loud querulous note; and the twittering blackbirds flying in sable clouds, and the golden- winged woodpecker with his crimson crest, his broad black gorget, and splendid plumage; and the cedar-bird, with its red tipt wings and yellow-tipt tail and its little monteiro cap of feathers; and the blue jay, that noisy coxcomb, in his gay light blue coat and white underclothes, screaming and chattering, nodding and bobbing and bowing, and pretending to be on good terms with every songster of the grove.  <br><br>  As Ichabod jogged slowly on his way, his eye, ever open to every symptom of culinary abundance, ranged with delight over the treasures of jolly autumn. On all sides he beheld vast store of apples: some hanging in oppressive opulence on the trees; some gathered into baskets and barrels for the market; others heaped up in rich piles for the cider-press. Farther on he beheld great fields of Indian corn, with its golden ears peeping from their leafy coverts, and holding out the promise of cakes and hasty- pudding; and the yellow pumpkins lying beneath them, turning up their fair round bellies to the sun, and giving ample prospects of the most luxurious of pies; and anon he passed the fragrant buckwheat fields breathing the odor of the beehive, and as he beheld them, soft anticipations stole over his mind of dainty slap-jacks, well buttered, and garnished with honey or treacle, by the delicate little dimpled hand of Katrina Van Tassel.  <br><br>  Thus feeding his mind with many sweet thoughts and ""sugared suppositions,"" he journeyed along the sides of a range of hills which look out upon some of the goodliest scenes of the mighty Hudson. The sun gradually wheeled his broad disk down in the west. The wide bosom of the Tappan Zee lay motionless and glassy, excepting that here and there a gentle undulation waved and prolonged the blue shallow of the distant mountain. A few amber clouds floated in the sky, without a breath of air to move them. The horizon was of a fine golden tint, changing gradually into a pure apple green, and from that into the deep blue of the mid- heaven. A slanting ray lingered on the woody crests of the precipices that overhung some parts of the river, giving greater depth to the dark gray and purple of their rocky sides. A sloop was loitering in the distance, dropping slowly down with the tide, her sail hanging uselessly against the mast; and as the reflection of the sky gleamed along the still water, it seemed as if the vessel was suspended in the air.  <br><br>  It was toward evening that Ichabod arrived at the castle of the Heer Van Tassel, which he found thronged with the pride and flower of the adjacent country Old farmers, a spare leathern- faced race, in homespun coats and breeches, blue stockings, huge shoes, and magnificent pewter buckles. Their brisk, withered little dames, in close crimped caps, long waisted short-gowns, homespun petticoats, with scissors and pin-cushions, and gay calico pockets hanging on the outside. Buxom lasses, almost as antiquated as their mothers, excepting where a straw hat, a fine ribbon, or perhaps a white frock, gave symptoms of city innovation. The sons, in short square-skirted coats, with rows of stupendous brass buttons, and their hair generally queued in the fashion of the times, especially if they could procure an eelskin for the purpose, it being esteemed throughout the country as a potent nourisher and strengthener of the hair.  <br><br>  Brom Bones, however, was the hero of the scene, having come to the gathering on his favorite steed Daredevil, a creature, like himself, full of mettle and mischief, and which no one but himself could manage. He was, in fact, noted for preferring vicious animals, given to all kinds of tricks which kept the rider in constant risk of his neck, for he held a tractable, wellbroken horse as unworthy of a lad of spirit.  <br><br>  Fain would I pause to dwell upon the world of charms that burst upon the enraptured gaze of my hero, as he entered the state parlor of Van Tassel's mansion. Not those of the bevy of buxom lasses, with their luxurious display of red and white; but the ample charms of a genuine Dutch country tea-table, in the sumptuous time of autumn. Such heaped up platters of cakes of various and almost indescribable kinds, known only to experienced Dutch housewives! There was the doughty doughnut, the tender olykoek, and the crisp and crumbling cruller; sweet cakes and short cakes, ginger cakes and honey cakes, and the whole family of cakes. And then there were apple pies, and peach pies, and pumpkin pies; besides slices of ham and smoked beef; and moreover delectable dishes of preserved plums, and peaches, and pears, and quinces; not to mention broiled shad and roasted chickens; together with bowls of milk and cream, all mingled higgledy- pigglely, pretty much as I have enumerated them, with the motherly teapot sending up its clouds of vapor from the midst-- Heaven bless the mark! I want breath and time to discuss this banquet as it deserves, and am too eager to get on with my story. Happily, Ichabod Crane was not in so great a hurry as his historian, but did ample justice to every dainty.  <br><br>  He was a kind and thankful creature, whose heart dilated in proportion as his skin was filled with good cheer, and whose spirits rose with eating, as some men's do with drink. He could not help, too, rolling his large eyes round him as he ate, and chuckling with the possibility that he might one day be lord of all this scene of almost unimaginable luxury and splendor. Then, he thought, how soon he 'd turn his back upon the old schoolhouse; snap his fingers in the face of Hans Van Ripper, and every other niggardly patron, and kick any itinerant pedagogue out of doors that should dare to call him comrade!  <br><br>  Old Baltus Van Tassel moved about among his guests with a face dilated with content and goodhumor, round and jolly as the harvest moon. His hospitable attentions were brief, but expressive, being confined to a shake of the hand, a slap on the shoulder, a loud laugh, and a pressing invitation to ""fall to, and help themselves.""  <br><br>  And now the sound of the music from the common room, or hall, summoned to the dance. The musician was an old gray-headed negro, who had been the itinerant orchestra of the neighborhood for more than half a century. His instrument was as old and battered as himself. The greater part of the time he scraped on two or three strings, accompanying every movement of the bow with a motion of the head; bowing almost to the ground, and stamping with his foot whenever a fresh couple were to start.  <br><br>  Ichabod prided himself upon his dancing as much as upon his vocal powers. Not a limb, not a fibre about him was idle; and to have seen his loosely hung frame in full motion, and clattering about the room, you would have thought St. Vitus himself, that blessed patron of the dance, was figuring before you in person. He was the admiration of all the negroes; who, having gathered, of all ages and sizes, from the farm and the neighborhood, stood forming a pyramid of shining black faces at every door and window; gazing with delight at the scene; rolling their white eye-balls, and showing grinning rows of ivory from ear to ear. How could the flogger of urchins be otherwise than animated and joyous? the lady of his heart was his partner in the dance, and smiling graciously in reply to all his amorous oglings; while Brom Bones, sorely smitten with love and jealousy, sat brooding by himself in one corner.  <br><br>  When the dance was at an end, Ichabod was attracted to a knot of the sager folks, who, with Old V an Tassel, sat smoking at one end of the piazza, gossiping over former times, and drawing out long stories about the war. This neighborhood, at the time of which I am speaking, was one of those highly favored places which abound with chronicle and great men. The British and American line had run near it during the war; it had, therefore], been the scene of marauding and infested with refugees, cow-boys, and all kinds of border chivalry. Just sufficient time had elapsed to enable each story-teller to dress up his tale with a little becoming fiction, and, in the indistinctness of his recollection, to make himself the hero of every exploit.  <br><br>  There was the story of Doffue Martling, a large blue-bearded Dutchman, who had nearly taken a British frigate with an old iron nine-pounder from a mud breastwork, only that his gun burst at the sixth discharge. And there was an old gentleman who shall be nameless, being too rich a mynheer to be lightly mentioned, who, in the battle of White Plains, being an excellent master of defence, parried a musket-ball with a small-sword, insomuch that he absolutely felt it whiz round the blade, and glance off at the hilt; in proof of which he was ready at any time to show the sword, with the hilt a little bent. There were several more that had been equally great in the field, not one of whom but was persuaded that he had a considerable hand in bringing the war to a happy termination.  <br><br>  But all these were nothing to the tales of ghosts and apparitions that succeeded. The neighborhood is rich in legendary treasures of the kind. Local tales and superstitions thrive best in these sheltered, long settled retreats; but are trampled under foot by the shifting throng that forms the population of most of our country places. Besides, there is no encouragement for ghosts in most of our villages, for they have scarcely had time to finish their first nap and turn themselves in their graves, before their surviving friends have travelled away from the neighborhood; so that when they turn out at night to walk their rounds, they have no acquaintance left to call upon. This is perhaps the reason why we so seldom hear of ghosts except in our long-established Dutch communities.  <br><br>  The immediate cause, however, of the prevalence of supernatural stories in these parts, was doubtless owing to the vicinity of Sleepy Hollow. There was a contagion in the very air that blew from that haunted region; it breathed forth an atmosphere of dreams and fancies infecting all the land. Several of the Sleepy Hollow people were present at Van Tassel's, and, as usual, were doling out their wild and wonderful legends. Many dismal tales were told about funeral trains, and mourning cries and wailings heard and seen about the great tree where the unfortunate Major Andre was taken, and which stood in the neighborhood. Some mention was made also of the woman in white, that haunted the dark glen at Raven Rock, and was often heard to shriek on winter nights before a storm, having perished there in the snow. The chief part of the stories, however, turned upon the favorite spectre of Sleepy Hollow, the Headless Horseman, who had been heard several times of late, patrolling the country; and, it was said, tethered his horse nightly among the graves in the churchyard.  <br><br>  The sequestered situation of this church seems always to have made it a favorite haunt of troubled spirits. It stands on a knoll, surrounded by locust, trees and lofty elms, from among which its decent, whitewashed walls shine modestly forth, like Christian purity beaming through the shades of retirement. A gentle slope descends from it to a silver sheet of water, bordered by high trees, between which, peeps may be caught at the blue hills of the Hudson. To look upon its grass-grown yard, where the sunbeams seem to sleep so quietly, one would think that there at least the dead might rest in peace. On one side of the church extends a wide woody dell, along which raves a large brook among broken rocks and trunks of fallen trees. Over a deep black part of the stream, not far from the church, was formerly thrown a wooden bridge; the road that led to it, and the bridge itself, were thickly shaded by overhanging trees, which cast a gloom about it, even in the daytime; but occasioned a fearful darkness at night. Such was one of the favorite haunts of the Headless Horseman, and the place where he was most frequently encountered. The tale was told of old Brouwer, a most heretical disbeliever in ghosts, how he met the Horseman returning from his foray into Sleepy Hollow, and was obliged to get up behind him; how they galloped over bush and brake, over hill and swamp, until they reached the bridge; when the Horseman suddenly turned into a skeleton, threw old Brouwer into the brook, and sprang away over the tree-tops with a clap of thunder.  <br><br>  This story was immediately matched by a thrice marvellous adventure of Brom Bones, who made light of the Galloping Hessian as an arrant jockey. He affirmed that on returning one night from the neighboring village of Sing Sing, he had been overtaken by this midnight trooper; that he had offered to race with him for a bowl of punch, and should have won it too, for Daredevil beat the goblin horse all hollow, but just as they came to the church bridge, the Hessian bolted, and vanished in a flash of fire.  <br><br>  All these tales, told in that drowsy undertone with which men talk in the dark, the countenances of the listeners only now and then receiving a casual gleam from the glare of a pipe, sank deep in the mind of Ichabod. He repaid them in kind with large extracts from his invaluable author, Cotton Mather, and added many marvellous events that had taken place in his native State of Connecticut, and fearful sights which he had seen in his nightly walks about Sleepy Hollow.  <br><br>  The revel now gradually broke up. The old farmers gathered together their families in their wagons, and were heard for some time rattling along the hollow roads, and over the distant hills. Some of the damsels mounted on pillions behind their favorite swains, and their light-hearted laughter, mingling with the clatter of hoofs, echoed along the silent woodlands, sounding fainter and fainter, until they gradually died away, --and the late scene of noise and frolic was all silent and deserted. Ichabod only lingered behind, according to the custom of country lovers, to have a tete-a-tete with the heiress; fully convinced that he was now on the high road to success. What passed at this interview I will not pretend to say, for in fact I do not know. Something, however, I fear me, must have gone wrong, for he certainly sallied forth, after no very great interval, with an air quite desolate and chapfallen. Oh, these women! these women! Could that girl have been playing off any of her coquettish tricks? Was her encouragement of the poor pedagogue all a mere sham to secure her conquest of his rival? Heaven only knows, not I! Let it suffice to say, Ichabod stole forth with the air of one who had been sacking a henroost, rather than a fair lady's heart. Without looking to the right or left to notice the scene of rural wealth, on which he had so often gloated, he went straight to the stable, and with several hearty cuffs and kicks roused his steed most uncourteously from the comfortable quarters in which he was soundly sleeping, dreaming of mountains of corn and oats, and whole valleys of timothy and clover.  <br><br>  It was the very witching time of night that Ichabod, heavy hearted and crest-fallen, pursued his travels homewards, along the sides of the lofty hills which rise above Tarry Town, and which he had traversed so cheerily in the afternoon. The hour was as dismal as himself. Far below him the Tappan Zee spread its dusky and indistinct waste of waters, with here and there the tall mast of a sloop, riding quietly at anchor under the land. In the dead hush of midnight, he could even hear the barking of the watchdog from the opposite shore of the Hudson; but it was so vague and faint as only to give an idea of his distance from this faithful companion of man. Now and then, too, the long-drawn crowing of a cock, accidentally awakened, would sound far, far off, from some farmhouse away among the hills--but it was like a dreaming sound in his ear. No signs of life occurred near him, but occasionally the melancholy chirp of a cricket, or perhaps the guttural twang of a bull-frog from a neighboring marsh, as if sleeping uncomfortably and turning suddenly in his bed.  <br><br>  All the stories of ghosts and goblins that he had heard in the afternoon now came crowding upon his recollection. The night grew darker and darker; the stars seemed to sink deeper in the sky, and driving clouds occasionally hid them from his sight. He had never felt so lonely and dismal. He was, moreover, approaching the very place where many of the scenes of the ghost stories had been laid. In the centre of the road stood an enormous tulip-tree, which towered like a giant above all the other trees of the neighborhood, and formed a kind of landmark. Its limbs were gnarled and fantastic, large enough to form trunks for ordinary trees, twisting down almost to the earth, and rising again into the air. It was connected with the tragical story of the unfortunate Andre, who had been taken prisoner hard by; and was universally known by the name of Major Andre's tree. The common people regarded it with a mixture of respect and superstition, partly out of sympathy for the fate of its ill- starred namesake, and partly from the tales of strange sights, and doleful lamentations, told concerning it.  <br><br>  As Ichabod approached this fearful tree, he began to whistle; he thought his whistle was answered; it was but a blast sweeping sharply through the dry branches. As he approached a little nearer, he thought he saw something white, hanging in the midst of the tree: he paused, and ceased whistling but, on looking more narrowly, perceived that it was a place where the tree had been scathed by lightning, and the white wood laid bare. Suddenly he heard a groan--his teeth chattered, and his knees smote against the saddle: it was but the rubbing of one huge bough upon another, as they were swayed about by the breeze. He passed the tree in safety, but new perils lay before him.  <br><br>  About two hundred yards from the tree, a small brook crossed the road, and ran into a marshy and thickly-wooded glen, known by the name of Wiley's Swamp. A few rough logs, laid side by side, served for a bridge over this stream. On that side of the road where the brook entered the wood, a group of oaks and chestnuts, matted thick with wild grape-vines, threw a cavernous gloom over it. To pass this bridge was the severest trial. It was at this identical spot that the unfortunate Andre was captured, and under the covert of those chestnuts and vines were the sturdy yeomen concealed who surprised him. This has ever since been considered a haunted stream, and fearful are the feelings of the school-boy who has to pass it alone after dark.  <br><br>  As he approached the stream, his heart began to thump he summoned up, however, all his resolution, gave his horse half a score of kicks in the ribs, and attempted to dash briskly across the bridge; but instead of starting forward, the perverse old animal made a lateral movement, and ran broadside against the fence. Ichabod, whose fears increased with the delay, jerked the reins on the other side, and kicked lustily with the contrary foot: it was all in vain; his steed started, it is true, but it was only to plunge to the opposite side of the road into a thicket of brambles and alder-bushes. The schoolmaster now bestowed both whip and heel upon the starveling ribs of old Gunpowder, who dashed forward, snuffling and snorting, but came to a stand just by the bridge, with a suddenness that had nearly sent his rider sprawling over his head. Just at this moment a plashy tramp by the side of the bridge caught the sensitive ear of Ichabod. In the dark shadow of the grove, on the margin of the brook, he beheld something huge, misshapen and towering. It stirred not, but seemed gathered up in the gloom, like some gigantic monster ready to spring upon the traveller.  <br><br>  The hair of the affrighted pedagogue rose upon his head with terror. What was to be done? To turn and fly was now too late; and besides, what chance was there of escaping ghost or goblin, if such it was, which could ride upon the wings of the wind? Summoning up, therefore, a show of courage, he demanded in stammering accents, "" Who are you?"" He received no reply. He repeated his demand in a still more agitated voice. Still there was no answer. Once more he cudgelled the sides of the inflexible Gunpowder, and, shutting his eyes, broke forth with involuntary fervor into a psalm tune. Just then the shadowy object of alarm put itself in motion, and with a scramble and a bound stood at once in the middle of the road. Though the night was dark and dismal, yet the form of the unknown might now in some degree be ascertained. He appeared to be a horseman of large dimensions, and mounted on a black horse of powerful frame. He made no offer of molestation or sociability, but kept aloof on one side of the road, jogging along on the blind side of old Gunpowder, who had now got over his fright and waywardness.  <br><br>  Ichabod, who had no relish for this strange midnight companion, and bethought himself of the adventure of Brom Bones with the Galloping Hessian, now quickened his steed in hopes of leaving him behind. The stranger, however, quickened his horse to an equal pace. Ichabod pulled up, and fell into a walk, thinking to lag behind, --the other did the same. His heart began to sink within him; he endeavored to resume his psalm tune, but his parched tongue clove to the roof of his mouth, and he could not utter a stave. There was something in the moody and dogged silence of this pertinacious companion that was mysterious and appalling. It was soon fearfully accounted for. On mounting a rising ground, which brought the figure of his fellow-traveller in relief against the sky, gigantic in height, and muffled in a cloak, Ichabod was horror-struck on perceiving that he was headless! but his horror was still more increased on observing that the head, which should have rested on his shoulders, was carried before him on the pommel of his saddle! His terror rose to desperation; he rained a shower of kicks and blows upon Gunpowder, hoping by a sudden movement to give his companion the slip; but the spectre started full jump with him. Away, then, they dashed through thick and thin; stones flying and sparks flashing at every bound. Ichabod's flimsy garments fluttered in the air, as he stretched his long lank body away over his horse's head, in the eagerness of his flight.  <br><br>  They had now reached the road which turns off to Sleepy Hollow; but Gunpowder, who seemed possessed with a demon, instead of keeping up it, made an opposite turn, and plunged headlong down hill to the left. This road leads through a sandy hollow shaded by trees for about a quarter of a mile, where it crosses the bridge famous in goblin story; and just beyond swells the green knoll on which stands the whitewashed church.  <br><br>  As yet the panic of the steed had given his unskilful rider an apparent advantage in the chase, but just as he had got half way through the hollow, the girths of the saddle gave way, and he felt it slipping from under him. He seized it by the pommel, and endeavored to hold it firm, but in vain; and had just time to save himself by clasping old Gunpowder round the neck, when the saddle fell to the earth, and he heard it trampled under foot by his pursuer. For a moment the terror of Hans Van Ripper's wrath passed across his mind, --for it was his Sunday saddle; but this was no time for petty fears; the goblin was hard on his haunches; and (unskilful rider that he was!) he had much ado to maintain his seat; sometimes slipping on one side, sometimes on another, and sometimes jolted on the high ridge of his horse's backbone, with a violence that he verily feared would cleave him asunder.  <br><br>  An opening, in the trees now cheered him with the hopes that the church bridge was at hand. The wavering reflection of a silver star in the bosom of the brook told him that he was not mistaken. He saw the walls of the church dimly glaring under the trees beyond. He recollected the place where Brom Bones' ghostly competitor had disappeard. ""If I can but reach that bridge,"" thought Ichabod, "" I am safe."" Just then he heard the black steed panting and blowing close behind him; he even fancied that he felt his hot breath. Another convulsive kick in the ribs, and old Gunpowder sprang upon the bridge; he thundered over the resounding planks; he gained the opposite side; and now Ichabod cast a look behind to see if his pursuer should vanish, according to rule, in a flash of fire and brimstone. Just then he saw the goblin rising in his stirrups, and in the very act of hurling his head at him. Ichabod endeavored to dodge the horrible missile, but too late. It encountered his cranium with a tremendous crash, --he was tumbled headlong into the dust, and Gunpowder, the black steed, and the goblin rider, passed by like a whirlwind.  <br><br>  The next morning the old horse was found without his saddle, and with the bridle under his feet, soberly cropping the grass at his master's gate. Ichabod did not make his appearance at breakfast; dinner-hour came, but no Ichabod. The boys assembled at the schoolhouse, and strolled idly about the banks of the brook; but no schoolmaster. Hans Van Ripper now began to feel some uneasiness about the fate of poor Ichabod, and his saddle. An inquiry was set on foot, and after diligent investigation they came upon his traces. In one part of the road leading to the church was found the saddle trampled in the dirt; the tracks of horses' hoofs deeply dented in the road, and evidently at furious speed, were traced to the bridge, beyond which, on the bank of a broad part of the brook, where the water ran deep and black, was found the head of the unfortunate Ichabod, and close beside it a shattered pumpkin.  <br><br>  The brook was searched, but the body of the schoolmaster was not to be discovered. Hans Van Ripper as executor of his estate, examined the bundle which contained all his worldly effects. They consisted of two shirts and a half; two stocks for the neck; a pair or two of worsted stockings; an old pair of corduroy small- clothes; a rusty razor; a book of psalm tunes full of dog's-ears; and a broken pitch-pipe. As to the books and furniture of the schoolhouse, they belonged to the community, excepting Cotton Mather's History of Witchcraft, a New England Almanac, and book of dreams and fortune-telling; in which last was a sheet of foolscap much scribbled and blotted in several fruitless attempts to make a copy of verses in honor of the heiress of Van Tassel. These magic books and the poetic scrawl were forthwith consigned to the flames by Hans Van Ripper; who, from that time forward, determined to send his children no more to school; observing that he never knew any good come of this same reading and writing. Whatever money the schoolmaster possessed, and he had received his quarter's pay but a day or two before, he must have had about his person at the time of his disappearance.  <br><br>  The mysterious event caused much speculation at the church on the following Sunday.

15,"My Kinsman, Major Molineux - By Young Goodman Brown","AFTER the kings of Great Britain had assumed the right of appointing the colonial governors, the measures of the latter seldom met with the ready and generous approbation which had been paid to those of their predecessors, under the original charters. The people looked with most jealous scrutiny to the exercise of power which did not emanate from themselves, and they usually rewarded their rulers with slender gratitude for the compliances by which, in softening their instructions from beyond the sea, they had incurred the reprehension of those who gave them. The annals of Massachusetts Bay will inform us, that of six governors in the space of about forty years from the surrender of the old charter, under James II., two were imprisoned by a popular insurrection; a third, as Hutchinson inclines to believe, was driven from the province by the whizzing of a musket-ball; a fourth, in the opinion of the same historian, was hastened to his grave by continual bickerings with the House of Representatives; and the remaining two, as well as their successors, till the Revolution, were favored with few and brief intervals of peaceful sway. The inferior members of the court party, in times of high political excitement, led scarcely a more desirable life. These remarks may serve as a preface to the following adventures, which chanced upon a summer night, not far from a hundred years ago. The reader, in order to avoid a long and dry detail of colonial affairs, is requested to dispense with an account of the train of circumstances that had caused much temporary inflammation of the popular mind.  <br><br>  It was near nine o'clock of a moonlight evening, when a boat crossed the ferry with a single passenger, who had obtained his conveyance at that unusual hour by the promise of an extra fare. While he stood on the landing-place, searching in either pocket for the means of fulfilling his agreement, the ferryman lifted a lantern, by the aid of which, and the newly risen moon, he took a very accurate survey of the stranger's figure. He was a youth of barely eighteen years, evidently country-bred, and now, as it should seem, upon his first visit to town. He was clad in a coarse gray coat, well worn, but in excellent repair; his under garments were durably constructed of leather, and fitted tight to a pair of serviceable and well-shaped limbs; his stockings of blue yarn were the incontrovertible work of a mother or a sister; and on his head was a three-cornered hat, which in its better days had perhaps sheltered the graver brow of the lad's father. Under his left arm was a heavy cudgel formed of an oak sapling, and retaining a part of the hardened root; and his equipment was completed by a wallet, not so abundantly stocked as to incommode the vigorous shoulders on which it hung. Brown, curly hair, well-shaped features, and bright, cheerful eyes were nature's gifts, and worth all that art could have done for his adornment.  <br><br>  The youth, one of whose names was Robin, finally drew from his pocket the half of a little province bill of five shillings, which, in the depreciation in that sort of currency, did but satisfy the ferryman's demand, with the surplus of a sexangular piece of parchment, valued at three pence. He then walked forward into the town, with as light a step as if his day's journey had not already exceeded thirty miles, and with as eager an eye as if he were entering London city, instead of the little metropolis of a New England colony. Before Robin had proceeded far, however, it occurred to him that he knew not whither to direct his steps; so he paused, and looked up and down the narrow street, scrutinizing the small and mean wooden buildings that were scattered on either side.  <br><br>  ``This low hovel cannot be my kinsman's dwelling,'' thought he, ``nor yonder old house, where the moonlight enters at the broken casement; and truly I see none hereabouts that might be worthy of him. It would have been wise to inquire my way of the ferryman, and doubtless he would have gone with me, and earned a shilling from the Major for his pains. But the next man I meet will do as well.''  <br><br>  He resumed his walk, and was glad to perceive that the street now became wider, and the houses more respectable in their appearance. He soon discerned a figure moving on moderately in advance, and hastened his steps to overtake it. As Robin drew nigh, he saw that the passenger was a man in years, with a full periwig of gray hair, a wide-skirted coat of dark cloth, and silk stockings rolled above his knees. He carried a long and polished cane, which he struck down perpendicularly before him at every step; and at regular intervals he uttered two successive hems, of a peculiarly solemn and sepulchral intonation. Having made these observations, Robin laid hold of the skirt of the old man's coat just when the light from the open door and windows of a barber's shop fell upon both their figures.  <br><br>  ``Good evening to you, honored sir,'' said he, making a low bow, and still retaining his hold of the skirt. ``I pray you tell me whereabouts is the dwelling of my kinsman, Major Molineux.''  <br><br>  The youth's question was uttered very loudly; and one of the barbers, whose razor was descending on a well-soaped chin, and another who was dressing a Ramillies wig, left their occupations, and came to the door. The citizen, in the mean time, turned a long-favored countenance upon Robin, and answered him in a tone of excessive anger and annoyance. His two sepulchral hems, however, broke into the very centre of his rebuke, with most singular effect, like a thought of the cold grave obtruding among wrathful passions.  <br><br>  ``Let go my garment, fellow! I tell you, I know not the man you speak of. What! I have authority, I have -- hem, hem -- authority; and if this be the respect you show for your betters, your feet shall be brought acquainted with the stocks by daylight, tomorrow morning!''  <br><br>  Robin released the old man's skirt, and hastened away, pursued by an ill-mannered roar of laughter from the barber's shop. He was at first considerably surprised by the result of his question, but, being a shrewd youth, soon thought himself able to account for the mystery.  <br><br>  ``This is some country representative,'' was his conclusion, ``who has never seen the inside of my kinsman's door, and lacks the breeding to answer a stranger civilly. The man is old, or verily -- I might be tempted to turn back and smite him on the nose. Ah, Robin, Robin! even the barber's boys laugh at you for choosing such a guide! You will be wiser in time, friend Robin.''  <br><br>  He now became entangled in a succession of crooked and narrow streets, which crossed each other, and meandered at no great distance from the water-side. The smell of tar was obvious to his nostrils, the masts of vessels pierced the moonlight above the tops of the buildings, and the numerous signs, which Robin paused to read, informed him that he was near the centre of business. But the streets were empty, the shops were closed, and lights were visible only in the second stories of a few dwelling-houses. At length, on the corner of a narrow lane, through which he was passing, he beheld the broad countenance of a British hero swinging before the door of an inn, whence proceeded the voices of many guests. The casement of one of the lower windows was thrown back, and a very thin curtain permitted Robin to distinguish a party at supper, round a well-furnished table. The fragrance of the good cheer steamed forth into the outer air, and the youth could not fail to recollect that the last remnant of his travelling stock of provision had yielded to his morning appetite, and that noon had found and left him dinnerless.  <br><br>  ""Oh, that a parchment three-penny might give me a right to sit down at yonder table!'' said Robin, with a sigh. ``But the Major will make me welcome to the best of his victuals; so I will even step boldly in, and inquire my way to his dwelling.''  <br><br>  He entered the tavern, and was guided by the murmur of voices and the fumes of tobacco to the public-room. It was a long and low apartment, with oaken walls, grown dark in the continual smoke, and a floor which was thickly sanded, but of no immaculate purity. A number of persons -- the larger part of whom appeared to be mariners, or in some way connected with the sea -- occupied the wooden benches, or leather-bottomed chairs, conversing on various matters, and occasionally lending their attention to some topic of general interest. Three or four little groups were draining as many bowls of punch, which the West India trade had long since made a familiar drink in the colony. Others, who had the appearance of men who lived by regular and laborious handicraft, preferred the insulated bliss of an unshared potation, and became more taciturn under its influence. Nearly all, in short, evinced a predilection for the Good Creature in some of its various shapes, for this is a vice to which, as Fast Day sermons of a hundred years ago will testify, we have a long hereditary claim. The only guests to whom Robin's sympathies inclined him were two or three sheepish countrymen, who were using the inn somewhat after the fashion of a Turkish caravansary; they had gotten themselves into the darkest corner of the room, and heedless of the Nicotian atmosphere, were supping on the bread of their own ovens, and the bacon cured in their own chimney-smoke. But though Robin felt a sort of brotherhood with these strangers, his eyes were attracted from them to a person who stood near the door, holding whispered conversation with a group of ill-dressed associates. His features were separately striking almost to grotesqueness, and the whole face left a deep impression on the memory. The forehead bulged out into a double prominence, with a vale between; the nose came boldly forth in an irregular curve, and its bridge was of more than a finger's breadth; the eyebrows were deep and shaggy, and the eyes glowed beneath them like fire in a cave.  <br><br>  While Robin deliberated of whom to inquire respecting his kinsman's dwelling, he was accosted by the innkeeper, a little man in a stained white apron, who had come to pay his professional welcome to the stranger. Being in the second generation from a French Protestant, he seemed to have inherited the courtesy of his parent nation; but no variety of circumstances was ever known to change his voice from the one shrill note in which he now addressed Robin.  <br><br>  ``From the country, I presume, sir?'' said he, with a profound bow. ``Beg leave to congratulate you on your arrival, and trust you intend a long stay with us. Fine town here, sir, beautiful buildings, and much that may interest a stranger. May I hope for the honor of your commands in respect to supper?''  <br><br>  ``The man sees a family likeness! the rogue has guessed that I am related to the Major!'' thought Robin, who had hitherto experienced little superfluous civility.  <br><br>  All eyes were now turned on the country lad, standing at the door, in his worn three-cornered hat, gray coat, leather breeches, and blue yarn stockings, leaning on an oaken cudgel, and bearing a wallet on his back.  <br><br>  Robin replied to the courteous innkeeper, with such an assumption of confidence as befitted the Major's relative. ``My honest friend,'' he said, ``I shall make it a point to patronize your house on some occasion, when'' -- here he could not help lowering his voice -- ``when I may have more than a parchment three-pence in my pocket. My present business,'' continued he, speaking with lofty confidence, ``is merely to inquire my way to the dwelling of my kinsman, Major Molineux.''  <br><br>  There was a sudden and general movement in the room, which Robin interpreted as expressing the eagerness of each individual to become his guide. But the innkeeper turned his eyes to a written paper on the wall, which he read, or seemed to read, with occasional recurrences to the young man's figure.  <br><br>  ``What have we here?'' said he, breaking his speech into little dry fragments. `` `Left the house of the subscriber, bounden servant, Hezekiah Mudge, -- had on, when he went away, gray coat, leather breeches, master's third-best hat. One pound currency reward to whosoever shall lodge him in any jail of the providence.' Better trudge, boy; better trudge!''  <br><br>  Robin had begun to draw his hand towards the lighter end of the oak cudgel, but a strange hostility in every countenance induced him to relinquish his purpose of breaking the courteous innkeeper's head. As he turned to leave the room, he encountered a sneering glance from the bold-featured personage whom he had before noticed; and no sooner was he beyond the door, than he heard a general laugh, in which the innkeeper's voice might be distinguished, like the dropping of small stones into a kettle.  <br><br>  ``Now, is it not strange,'' thought Robin, with his usual shrewdness, -- ``is it not strange that the confession of an empty pocket should outweigh the name of my kinsman, Major Molineux? Oh, if I had one of those grinning rascals in the woods, where I and my oak sapling grew up together, I would teach him that my arm is heavy though my purse be light!''  <br><br>  On turning the corner of the narrow lane, Robin found himself in a spacious street, with an unbroken line of lofty houses on each side, and a steepled building at the upper end, whence the ringing of a bell announced the hour of nine. The light of the moon, and the lamps from the numerous shop-windows, discovered people promenading on the pavement, and amongst them Robin had hoped to recognize his hitherto inscrutable relative. The result of his former inquiries made him unwilling to hazard another, in a scene of such publicity, and he determined to walk slowly and silently up the street, thrusting his face close to that of every elderly gentleman, in search of the Major's lineaments. In his progress, Robin encountered many gay and gallant figures. Embroidered garments of showy colors, enormous periwigs, gold-laced hats, and silver-hilted swords glided past him and dazzled his optics. Travelled youths, imitators of the European fine gentlemen of the period, trod jauntily along, half dancing to the fashionable tunes which they hummed, and making poor Robin ashamed of his quiet and natural gait. At length, after many pauses to examine the gorgeous display of goods in the shop-windows, and after suffering some rebukes for the impertinence of his scrutiny into people's faces, the Major's kinsman found himself near the steepled building, still unsuccessful in his search. As yet, however, he had seen only one side of the thronged street; so Robin crossed, and continued the same sort of inquisition down the opposite pavement, with stronger hopes than the philosopher seeking an honest man, but with no better fortune. He had arrived about midway towards the lower end, from which his course began, when he overheard the approach of some one who struck down a cane on the flag-stones at every step, uttering at regular intervals, two sepulchral hems.  <br><br>  ``Mercy on us!'' quoth Robin, recognizing the sound.  <br><br>  Turning a corner, which chanced to be close at his right hand, he hastened to pursue his researches in some other part of the town. His patience now was wearing low, and he seemed to feel more fatigue from his rambles since he crossed the ferry, than from his journey of several days on the other side. Hunger also pleaded loudly within him, and Robin began to balance the propriety of demanding, violently, and with lifted cudgel, the necessary guidance from the first solitary passenger whom he should meet. While a resolution to this effect was gaining strength, he entered a street of mean appearance, on either side of which a row of ill-built houses was straggling towards the harbor. The moonlight fell upon no passenger along the whole extent, but in the third domicile which Robin passed there was a half-opened door, and his keen glance detected a woman's garment within.  <br><br>  ``My luck may be better here,'' said he to himself.  <br><br>  Accordingly, he approached the doors and beheld it shut closer as he did so; yet an open space remained, sufficing for the fair occupant to observe the stranger, without a corresponding display on her part. All that Robin could discern was a strip of scarlet petticoat, and the occasional sparkle of an eye, as if the moonbeams were trembling on some bright thing.  <br><br>  ``Pretty mistress,'' for I may call her so with a good conscience thought the shrewd youth, since I know nothing to the contrary, -- ``my sweet pretty mistress, will you be kind enough to tell me whereabouts I must seek the dwelling of my kinsman, Major Molineux?''  <br><br>  Robin's voice was plaintive and winning, and the female, seeing nothing to be shunned in the handsome country youth, thrust open the door, and came forth into the moonlight. She was a dainty little figure with a white neck, round arms, and a slender waist, at the extremity of which her scarlet petticoat jutted out over a hoop, as if she were standing in a balloon. Moreover, her face was oval and pretty, her hair dark beneath the little cap, and her bright eyes possessed a sly freedom, which triumphed over those of Robin.  <br><br>  ``Major Molineux dwells here,'' said this fair woman.  <br><br>  Now, her voice was the sweetest Robin had heard that night, yet he could not help doubting whether that sweet voice spoke Gospel truth. He looked up and down the mean street, and then surveyed the house before which they stood. It was a small, dark edifice of two stories, the second of which projected over the lower floor, and the front apartment had the aspect of a shop for petty commodities.  <br><br>  ``Now, truly, I am in luck,'' replied Robin, cunningly, ``and so indeed is my kinsman, the Major, in having so pretty a housekeeper. But I prithee trouble him to step to the door; I will deliver him a message from his friends in the country, and then go back to my lodgings at the inn.''  <br><br>  ``Nay, the Major has been abed this hour or more,'' said the lady of the scarlet petticoat; ``and it would be to little purpose to disturb him to-night, seeing his evening draught was of the strongest. But he is a kind-hearted man, and it would be as much as my life's worth to let a kinsman of his turn away from the door. You are the good old gentleman's very picture, and I could swear that was his rainy-weather hat. Also he has garments very much resembling those leather small-clothes. But come in, I pray, for I bid you hearty welcome in his name.  <br><br>  So saying, the fair and hospitable dame took our hero by the hand; and the touch was light, and the force was gentleness, and though Robin read in her eyes what he did not hear in her words, yet the slender-waisted woman in the scarlet petticoat proved stronger than the athletic country youth. She had drawn his half-willing footsteps nearly to the threshold, when the opening of a door in the neighborhood startled the Major's housekeeper, and, leaving the Major's kinsman, she vanished speedily into her own domicile. A heavy yawn preceded the appearance of a man, who, like the Moonshine of Pyramus and Thisbe, carried a lantern, needlessly aiding his sister luminary in the heavens. As he walked sleepily up the street, he turned his broad, dull face on Robin, and displayed a long staff, spiked at the end.  <br><br>  ``Home, vagabond, home!'' said the watchman, in accents that seemed to fall asleep as soon as they were uttered. ``Home, or we'll set you in the stocks by peep of day!''  <br><br>  ``This is the second hint of the kind,'' thought Robin. ``I wish they would end my difficulties, by setting me there to-night.''  <br><br>  Nevertheless, the youth felt an instinctive antipathy towards the guardian of midnight order, which at first prevented him from asking his usual question. But just when the man was about to vanish behind the corner, Robin resolved not to lose the opportunity, and shouted lustily after him, --  <br><br>  ``I say, friend! will you guide me to the house of my kinsman, Major Molineux?''  <br><br>  The watchman made no reply, but turned the corner and was gone; yet Robin seemed to hear the sound of drowsy laughter stealing along the solitary street. At that moment, also, a pleasant titter saluted him from the open window above his head; he looked up, and caught the sparkle of a saucy eye; a round arm beckoned to him, and next he heard light footsteps descending the staircase within. But Robin, being of the household of a New England clergyman, was a good youth, as well as a shrewd one; so he resisted temptation, and fled away.  <br><br>  He now roamed desperately, and at random, through the town, almost ready to believe that a spell was on him, like that by which a wizard of his country had once kept three pursuers wandering, a whole winter night, within twenty paces of the cottage which they sought. The streets lay before him, strange and desolate, and the lights were extinguished in almost every house. Twice, however, little parties of men, among whom Robin distinguished individuals in outlandish attire, came hurrying along; but, though on both occasions, they paused to address him such intercourse did not at all enlighten his perplexity. They did but utter a few words in some language of which Robin knew nothing, and perceiving his inability to answer, bestowed a curse upon him in plain English and hastened away. Finally, the lad determined to knock at the door of every mansion that might appear worthy to be occupied by his kinsman, trusting that perseverance would overcome the fatality that had hitherto thwarted him. Firm in this resolve, he was passing beneath the walls of a church, which formed the corner of two streets, when, as he turned into the shade of its steeple, he encountered a bulky stranger muffled in a cloak. The man was proceeding with the speed of earnest business, but Robin planted himself full before him, holding the oak cudgel with both hands across his body as a bar to further passage  <br><br>  ``Halt, honest man, and answer me a question,'' said he, very resolutely, ``Tell me, this instant, whereabouts is the dwelling of my kinsman, Major Molineux!''  <br><br>  ``Keep your tongue between your teeth, fool, and let me pass!'' said a deep, gruff voice, which Robin partly remembered. ``Let me pass, or I'll strike you to the earth!''  <br><br>  ``No, no, neighbor!'' cried Robin, flourishing his cudgel, and then thrusting its larger end close to the man's muffled face. ``No, no, I'm not the fool you take me for, nor do you pass till I have an answer to my question. Whereabouts is the dwelling of my kinsman, Major Molineux?'' The stranger, instead of attempting to force his passage, stepped back into the moonlight, unmuffled his face, and stared full into that of Robin.  <br><br>  ``Watch here an hour, and Major Molineux will pass by,'' said he.  <br><br>  Robin gazed with dismay and astonishment on the unprecedented physiognomy of the speaker. The forehead with its double prominence the broad hooked nose, the shaggy eyebrows, and fiery eyes were those which he had noticed at the inn, but the man's complexion had undergone a singular, or, more properly, a twofold change. One side of the face blazed an intense red, while the other was black as midnight, the division line being in the broad bridge of the nose; and a mouth which seemed to extend from ear to ear was black or red, in contrast to the color of the cheek. The effect was as if two individual devils, a fiend of fire and a fiend of darkness, had united themselves to form this infernal visage. The stranger grinned in Robin's face, muffled his party-colored features, and was out of sight in a moment.  <br><br>  ``Strange things we travellers see!'' ejaculated Robin.  <br><br>  He seated himself, however, upon the steps of the church-door, resolving to wait the appointed time for his kinsman. A few moments were consumed in philosophical speculations upon the species of man who had just left him; but having settled this point shrewdly, rationally, and satisfactorily, he was compelled to look elsewhere for his amusement. And first he threw his eyes along the street. It was of more respectable appearance than most of those into which he had wandered, and the moon, creating, like the imaginative power, a beautiful strangeness in familiar objects, gave something of romance to a scene that might not have possessed it in the light of day. The irregular and often quaint architecture of the houses, some of whose roofs were broken into numerous little peaks, while others ascended, steep and narrow, into a single point, and others again were square; the pure snow-white of some of their complexions, the aged darkness of others, and the thousand sparklings, reflected from bright substances in the walls of many; these matters engaged Robin's attention for a while, and then began to grow wearisome. Next he endeavored to define the forms of distant objects, starting away, with almost ghostly indistinctness, just as his eye appeared to grasp them, and finally he took a minute survey of an edifice which stood on the opposite side of the street, directly in front of the church-door, where he was stationed. It was a large, square mansion, distinguished from its neighbors by a balcony, which rested on tall pillars, and by an elaborate Gothic window, communicating therewith.  <br><br>  ``Perhaps this is the very house I have been seeking,'' thought Robin.  <br><br>  Then he strove to speed away the time, by listening to a murmur which swept continually along the street, yet was scarcely audible, except to an unaccustomed ear like his; it was a low, dull, dreamy sound, compounded of many noises, each of which was at too great a distance to be separately heard. Robin marvelled at this snore of a sleeping town, and marvelled more whenever its continuity was broken by now and then a distant shout, apparently loud where it originated. But altogether it was a sleep-inspiring sound, and, to shake off its drowsy influence, Robin arose, and climbed a window-frame, that he might view the interior of the church. There the moonbeams came trembling in, and fell down upon the deserted pews, and extended along the quiet aisles. A fainter yet more awful radiance was hovering around the pulpit, and one solitary ray had dared to rest upon the open page of the great Bible. Had nature, in that deep hour, become a worshipper in the house which man had builded? Or was that heavenly light the visible sanctity of the place, -- visible because no earthly and impure feet were within the walls? The scene made Robin's heart shiver with a sensation of loneliness stronger than he had ever felt in the remotest depths of his native woods; so he turned away and sat down again before the door. There were graves around the church, and now an uneasy thought obtruded into Robin's breast. What if the object of his search, which had been so often and so strangely thwarted, were all the time mouldering in his shroud? What if his kinsman should glide through yonder gate, and nod and smile to him in dimly passing by?  <br><br>  ``Oh that any breathing thing were here with me!'' said Robin.  <br><br>  Recalling his thoughts from this uncomfortable track, he sent them over forest, hill, and stream, and attempted to imagine how that evening of ambiguity and weariness had been spent by his father's household. He pictured them assembled at the door, beneath the tree, the great old tree, which had been spared for its huge twisted trunk and venerable shade, when a thousand leafy brethren fell. There, at the going down of the summer sun, it was his father's custom to perform domestic worship that the neighbors might come and join with him like brothers of the family, and that the wayfaring man might pause to drink at that fountain, and keep his heart pure by freshening the memory of home. Robin distinguished the seat of every individual of the little audience; he saw the good man in the midst, holding the Scriptures in the golden light that fell from the western clouds; he beheld him close the book and all rise up to pray. He heard the old thanksgivings for daily mercies, the old supplications for their continuance to which he had so often listened in weariness, but which were now among his dear remembrances. He perceived the slight inequality of his father's voice when he came to speak of the absent one; he noted how his mother turned her face to the broad and knotted trunk; how his elder brother scorned, because the beard was rough upon his upper lip; to permit his features to be moved; how the younger sister drew down a low hanging branch before her eyes; and how the little one of all, whose sports had hitherto broken the decorum of the scene, understood the prayer for her playmate, and burst into clamorous grief. Then he saw them go in at the door; and when Robin would have entered also, the latch tinkled into its place, and he was excluded from his home.  <br><br>  ``Am I here, or there?'' cried Robin, starting; for all at once, when his thoughts had become visible and audible in a dream, the long, wide, solitary street shone out before him.  <br><br>  He aroused himself, and endeavored to fix his attention steadily upon the large edifice which he had surveyed before. But still his mind kept vibrating between fancy and reality; by turns, the pillars of the balcony lengthened into the tall, bare stems of pines, dwindled down to human figures, settled again into their true shape and size, and then commenced a new succession of changes. For a single moment, when he deemed himself awake, he could have sworn that a visage -- one which he seemed to remember, yet could not absolutely name as his kinsman's -- was looking towards him from the Gothic window. A deeper sleep wrestled with and nearly overcame him, but fled at the sound of footsteps along the opposite pavement. Robin rubbed his eyes, discerned a man passing at the foot of the balcony, and addressed him in a loud, peevish, and lamentable cry.  <br><br>  ``Hallo, friend! must I wait here all night for my kinsman, Major Molineux?''  <br><br>  The sleeping echoes awoke, and answered the voice; and the passenger, barely able to discern a figure sitting in the oblique shade of the steeple, traversed the street to obtain a nearer view. He was himself a gentleman in his prime, of open, intelligent, cheerful, and altogether pre-possessing countenance. Perceiving a country youth, apparently homeless and without friends, he accosted him in a tone of real kindness, which had become strange to Robin's ears.  <br><br>  ``Well, my good lad, why are you sitting here?'' inquired he. ``Can I be of service to you in any way?''  <br><br>  ``I am afraid not, sir,'' replied Robin, despondingly; ``yet I shall take it kindly, if you'll answer me a single question. I've been searching, half the night, for one Major Molineux, now, sir, is there really such a person in these parts, or am I dreaming?''  <br><br>  ``Major Molineux! The name is not altogether strange to me,'' said the gentleman, smiling. ``Have you any objection to telling me the nature of your business with him?''  <br><br>  Then Robin briefly related that his father was a clergyman, settled on a small salary, at a long distance back in the country, and that he and Major Molineux were brothers' children. The Major, having inherited riches, and acquired civil and military rank, had visited his cousin, in great pomp, a year or two before; had manifested much interest in Robin and an elder brother, and, being childless himself, had thrown out hints respecting the future establishment of one of them in life. The elder brother was destined to succeed to the farm which his father cultivated in the interval of sacred duties; it was therefore determined that Robin should profit by his kinsman's generous intentions, especially as he seemed to be rather the favorite, and was thought to possess other necessary endowments.  <br><br>  ``For I have the name of being a shrewd youth,'' observed Robin, in this part of his story.  <br><br>  ``I doubt not you deserve it,'' replied his new friend, good-naturedly; ``but pray proceed.''  <br><br>  ``Well, sir, being nearly eighteen years old, and well grown, as you see,'' continued Robin, drawing himself up to his full height, ``I thought it high time to begin in the world. So my mother and sister put me in handsome trim, and my father gave me half the remnant of his last year's salary, and five days ago I started for this place, to pay the Major a visit. But, would you believe it, sir! I crossed the ferry a little after dark, and have yet found nobody that would show me the way to his dwelling; only, an hour or two since, I was told to wait here, and Major Molineux would pass by.''  <br><br>  ``Can you describe the man who told you this?'' inquired the gentleman.  <br><br>  ``Oh, he was a very ill-favored fellow, sir,'' replied Robin, ``with two great bumps on his forehead, a hook nose, fiery eyes; and, what struck me as the strangest, his face was of two different colors. Do you happen to know such a man, sir?''  <br><br>  ``Not intimately,'' answered the stranger, ``but I chanced to meet him a little time previous to your stopping me. I believe you may trust his word, and that the Major will very shortly pass through this street. In the mean time, as I have a singular curiosity to witness your meeting, I will sit down here upon the steps and bear you company.''  <br><br>  He seated himself accordingly, and soon engaged his companion in animated discourse. It was but of brief continuance, however, for a noise of shouting, which had long been remotely audible, drew so much nearer that Robin inquired its cause.  <br><br>  ``What may be the meaning of this uproar?'' asked he. ``Truly, if your town be always as noisy, I shall find little sleep while I am an inhabitant.''  <br><br>  ``Why, indeed, friend Robin, there do appear to be three or four riotous fellows abroad to-night,'' replied the gentleman. ``You must not expect all the stillness of your native woods here in our streets. But the watch will shortly be at the heels of these lads and'' --  <br><br>  ``Ay, and set them in the stocks by peep of day,'' interrupted Robin recollecting his own encounter with the drowsy lantern-bearer. ``But, dear sir, if I may trust my ears, an army of watchmen would never make head against such a multitude of rioters. There were at least a thousand voices went up to make that one shout.''  <br><br>  ``May not a man have several voices, Robin, as well as two complexions? said his friend.  <br><br>  ``Perhaps a man may; but Heaven forbid that a woman should!'' responded the shrewd youth, thinking of the seductive tones of the Major's housekeeper.  <br><br>  The sounds of a trumpet in some neighboring street now became so evident and continual, that Robin's curiosity was strongly excited. In addition to the shouts, he heard frequent bursts from many instruments of discord, and a wild and confused laughter filled up the intervals. Robin rose from the steps, and looked wistfully towards a point whither people seemed to be hastening  <br><br>  ``Surely some prodigious merry-making is going on,'' exclaimed he ``I have laughed very little since I left home, sir, and should be sorry to lose an opportunity. Shall we step round the corner by that darkish house and take our share of the fun?''  <br><br>  ``Sit down again, sit down, good Robin,'' replied the gentleman, laying his hand on the skirt of the gray coat. ``You forget that we must wait here for your kinsman; and there is reason to believe that he will pass by, in the course of a very few moments.''  <br><br>  The near approach of the uproar had now disturbed the neighborhood; windows flew open on all sides; and many heads, in the attire of the pillow, and confused by sleep suddenly broken, were protruded to the gaze of whoever had leisure to observe them. Eager voices hailed each other from house to house, all demanding the explanation, which not a soul could give. Half-dressed men hurried towards the unknown commotion stumbling as they went over the stone steps that thrust themselves into the narrow foot-walk. The shouts, the laughter, and the tuneless bray the antipodes of music, came onwards with increasing din, till scattered individuals, and then denser bodies, began to appear round a corner at the distance of a hundred yards  <br><br>  ``Will you recognize your kinsman, if he passes in this crowd?'' inquired the gentleman  <br><br>  ``Indeed, I can't warrant it, sir; but I'll take my stand here, and keep a bright lookout,'' answered Robin, descending to the outer edge.  <br><br>  A mighty stream of people now emptied into the street, and came rollmg slowly towards the church. A single horseman wheeled the corner in the midst of them, and close behind him came a band of fearful wind-instruments, sending forth a fresher discord now that no intervening buildings kept it from the ear. Then a redder light disturbed the moonbeams, and a dense multitude of torches shone along the street, concealing, by their glare, whatever object they illuminated. The single horseman, clad in a military dress, and bearing a drawn sword, rode onward as the leader, and, by his fierce and variegated countenance, appeared like war personified; the red of one cheek was an emblem of fire and sword; the blackness of the other betokened the mourning that attends them. In his train were wild figures in the Indian dress, and many fantastic shapes without a model, giving the whole march a visionary air, as if a dream had broken forth from some feverish brain, and were sweeping visibly through the midnight streets. A mass of people, inactive, except as applauding spectators, hemmed the procession in; and several women ran along the sidewalk, piercing the confusion of heavier sounds with their shrill voices of mirth or terror.  <br><br>  ``The double-faced fellow has his eye upon me,'' muttered Robin, with an indefinite but an uncomfortable idea that he was himself to bear a part in the pageantry.  <br><br>  The leader turned himself in the saddle, and fixed his glance full upon the country youth, as the steed went slowly by. When Robin had freed his eyes from those fiery ones, the musicians were passing before him, and the torches were close at hand; but the unsteady brightness of the latter formed a veil which he could not penetrate. The rattling of wheels over the stones sometimes found its way to his ear, and confused traces of a human form appeared at intervals, and then melted into the vivid light. A moment more, and the leader thundered a command to halt: the trumpets vomited a horrid breath, and then held their peace; the shouts and laughter of the people died away, and there remained only a universal hum, allied to silence. Right before Robin's eyes was an uncovered cart. There the torches blazed the brightest, there the moon shone out like day, and there, in tar-and-feathery dignity, sat his kinsman, Major Molineux!  <br><br>  He was an elderly man, of large and majestic person, and strong, square features, betokening a steady soul; but steady as it was, his enemies had found means to shake it. His face was pale as death, and far more ghastly; the broad forehead was contracted in his agony, so that his eyebrows formed one grizzled line; his eyes were red and wild, and the foam hung white upon his quivering lip. His whole frame was agitated by a quick and continual tremor, which his pride strove to quell, even in those circumstances of overwhelming humiliation. But perhaps the bitterest pang of all was when his eyes met those of Robin; for he evidently knew him on the instant, as the youth stood witnessing the foul disgrace of a head grown gray in honor. They stared at each other in silence, and Robin's knees shook, and his hair bristled, with a mixture of pity and terror. Soon, however, a bewildering excitement began to seize upon his mind; the preceding adventures of the night, the unexpected appearance of the crowd, the torches, the confused din and the hush that followed, the spectre of his kinsman reviled by that great multitude, -- all this, and, more than all, a perception of tremendous ridicule in the whole scene, affected him with a sort of mental inebriety. At that moment a voice of sluggish merriment saluted Robin's ears; he turned instinctively, and just behind the corner of the church stood the lantern-bearer, rubbing his eyes, and drowsily enjoying the lad's amazement. Then he heard a peal of laughter like the ringing of silvery bells; a woman twitched his arm, a saucy eye met his, and he saw the lady of the scarlet petticoat. A sharp, dry cachinnation appealed to his memory, and, standing on tiptoe in the crowd, with his white apron over his head, he beheld the courteous little innkeeper. And lastly, there sailed over the heads of the multitude a great, broad laugh, broken in the midst by two sepulchral hems; thus, ``Haw, haw, haw, -- hem, hem, -- haw, haw, haw, haw!''  <br><br>  The sound proceeded from the balcony of the opposite edifice, and thither Robin turned his eyes. In front of the Gothic window stood the old citizen, wrapped in a wide gown, his gray periwig exchanged for a nightcap, which was thrust back from his forehead, and his silk stockings hanging about his legs. He supported himself on his polished cane in a fit of convulsive merriment, which manifested itself on his solemn old features like a funny inscription on a tombstone. Then Robin seemed to hear the voices of the barbers, of the guests of the inn, and of all who had made sport of him that night. The contagion was spreading among the multitude, when all at once, it seized upon Robin, and he sent forth a shout of laughter that echoed through the street, -- every man shook his sides, every man emptied his lungs, but Robin's shout was the loudest there. The cloud-spirits peeped from their silvery islands, as the congregated mirth went roaring up the sky! The Man in the Moon heard the far bellow. ``Oho,'' quoth he, ``the old earth is frolicsome to-night!''  <br><br>  When there was a momentary calm in that tempestuous sea of sound, the leader gave the sign, the procession resumed its march. On they went, like fiends that throng in mockery around some dead potentate, mighty no more, but majestic still in his agony. On they went, in counterfeited pomp, in senseless uproar, in frenzied merriment, trampling all on an old man's heart. On swept the tumult, and left a silent street behind.  <br><br>  . . . . . . . . . . .  <br><br>  ``Well, Robin, are you dreaming?'' inquired the gentleman, laying his hand on the youth's shoulder.  <br><br>  Robin started, and withdrew his arm from the stone post to which he had instinctively clung, as the living stream rolled by him. His cheek was somewhat pale, and his eye not quite as lively as in the earlier part of the evening.  <br><br>  ``Will you be kind enough to show me the way to the ferry?'' said he, after a moment's pause.  <br><br>  ``You have, then, adopted a new subject of inquiry?'' observed his companion, with a smile.  <br><br>  ``Why, yes, sir,'' replied Robin, rather dryly. ``Thanks to you, and to my other friends, I have at last met my kinsman, and he will scarce desire to see my face again. I begin to grow weary of a town life, sir. Will you show me the way to the ferry?''  <br><br>  ``No, my good friend Robin, -- not to-night, at least,'' said the gentleman. ``Some few days hence, if you wish it, I will speed you on your journey. Or, if you prefer to remain with us, perhaps, as you are a shrewd youth, you may rise in the world without the help of your kinsman, Major Molineux.''                             <br><br>"
16,The Cactus - By O. Henry,"The most notable thing about Time is that it is so purely relative. A large amount of reminiscence is, by common consent, conceded to the drowning man; and it is not past belief that one may review an entire courtship while removing one's gloves.<br><br>    That is what Trysdale was doing, standing by a table in his bachelor apartments. On the table stood a singular-looking green plant in a red earthen jar. The plant was one of the species of cacti, and was provided with long, tentacular leaves that perpetually swayed with the slightest breeze with a peculiar beckoning motion.<br><br>    Trysdale's friend, the brother of the bride, stood at a sideboard complaining at being allowed to drink alone. Both men were in evening dress. White favors like stars upon their coats shone through the gloom of the apartment.<br><br>    As he slowly unbuttoned his gloves, there passed through Trysdale's mind a swift, scarifying retrospect of the last few hours. It seemed that in his nostrils was still the scent of the flowers that had been banked in odorous masses about the church, and in his ears the lowpitched hum of a thousand well-bred voices, the rustle of crisp garments, and, most insistently recurring, the drawling words of the minister irrevocably binding her to another.<br><br>    From this last hopeless point of view he still strove, as if it had become a habit of his mind, to reach some conjecture as to why and how he had lost her. Shaken rudely by the uncompromising fact, he had suddenly found himself confronted by a thing he had never before faced --his own innermost, unmitigated, arid unbedecked self. He saw all the garbs of pretence and egoism that he had worn now turn to rags of folly. He shuddered at the thought that to others, before now, the garments of his soul must have appeared sorry and threadbare. Vanity and conceit? These were the joints in his armor. And how free from either she had always been--But why--<br><br>    As she had slowly moved up the aisle toward the altar he had felt an unworthy, sullen exultation that had served to support him. He had told himself that her paleness was from thoughts of another than the man to whom she was about to give herself. But even that poor consolation had been wrenched from him. For, when he saw that swift, limpid, upward look that she gave the man when he took her hand, he knew himself to be forgotten. Once that same look had been raised to him, and he had gauged its meaning. Indeed, his conceit had crumbled; its last prop was gone. Why had it ended thus? There had been no quarrel between them, nothing--<br><br>    For the thousandth time he remarshalled in his mind the events of those last few days before the tide had so suddenly turned.<br><br>    She had always insisted upon placing him upon a pedestal, and he had accepted her homage with royal grandeur. It had been a very sweet incense that she had burned before him; so modest (he told himself); so childlike and worshipful, and (he would once have sworn) so sincere. She had invested him with an almost supernatural number of high attributes and excellencies and talents, and he had absorbed the oblation as a desert drinks the rain that can coax from it no promise of blossom or fruit.<br><br>    As Trysdale grimly wrenched apart the seam of his last glove, the crowning instance of his fatuous and tardily mourned egoism came vividly back to him. The scene was the night when he had asked her to come up on his pedestal with him and share his greatness. He could not, now, for the pain of it, allow his mind to dwell upon the memory of her convincing beauty that night--the careless wave of her hair, the tenderness and virginal charm of her looks and words. But they had been enough, and they had brought him to speak. During their conversation she had said:<br><br>    ""And Captain Carruthers tells me that you speak the Spanish language like a native. Why have you hidden this accomplishment from me? Is there anything you do not know?""<br><br>    Now, Carruthers was an idiot. No doubt he (Trysdale) had been guilty (he sometimes did such things) of airing at the club some old, canting Castilian proverb dug from the hotchpotch at the back of dictionaries. Carruthers, who was one of his incontinent admirers, was the very man to have magnified this exhibition of doubtful erudition.<br><br>    But, alas! the incense of her admiration had been so sweet and flattering. He allowed the imputation to pass without denial. Without protest, he allowed her to twine about his brow this spurious bay of Spanish scholarship. He let it grace his conquering head, and, among its soft convolutions, he did not feel the prick of the thorn that was to pierce him later.<br><br>    How glad, how shy, how tremulous she was! How she fluttered like a snared bird when he laid his mightiness at her feet! He could have sworn, and he could swear now, that unmistakable consent was in her eyes, but, coyly, she would give him no direct answer. ""I will send you my answer to-morrow,"" she said; and he, the indulgent, confident victor, smilingly granted the delay. The next day he waited, impatient, in his rooms for the word. At noon her groom came to the door and left the strange cactus in the red earthen jar. There was no note, no message, merely a tag upon the plant bearing a barbarous foreign or botanical name. He waited until night, but her answer did not come. His large pride and hurt vanity kept him from seeking her. Two evenings later they met at a dinner. Their greetings were conventional, but she looked at him, breathless, wondering, eager. He was courteous, adamant, waiting her explanation. With womanly swiftness she took her cue from his manner, and turned to snow and ice. Thus, and wider from this on, they had drifted apart. Where was his fault? Who had been to blame? Humbled now, he sought the answer amid the ruins of his self-conceit. If--<br><br>    The voice of the other man in the room, querulously intruding upon his thoughts, aroused him.<br><br>    ""I say, Trysdale, what the deuce is the matter with you? You look unhappy as if you yourself had been married instead of having acted merely as an accomplice. Look at me, another accessory, come two thousand miles on a garlicky, cockroachy banana steamer all the way from South America to connive at the sacrifice--please to observe how lightly my guilt rests upon my shoulders. Only little sister I had, too, and now she's gone. Come now! take something to ease your conscience.""<br><br>    ""I don't drink just now, thanks,"" said Trysdale.<br><br>    ""Your brandy,"" resumed the other, coming over and joining him, ""is abominable. Run down to see me some time at Punta Redonda, and try some of our stuff that old Garcia smuggles in. It's worth the, trip. Hallo! here's an old acquaintance. Wherever did you rake up this cactus, Trysdale?""<br><br>    ""A present,"" said Trysdale, ""from a friend. Know the species?""<br><br>    ""Very well. It's a tropical concern. See hundreds of 'em around Punta every day. Here's the name on this tag tied to it. Know any Spanish, Trysdale?""<br><br>    ""No,"" said Trysdale, with the bitter wraith of a smile--""Is it Spanish?""<br><br>    ""Yes. The natives imagine the leaves are reaching out and beckoning to you. They call it by this name--Ventomarme. Name means in English, 'Come and take me.'""                             <br><br>"
17,The Tell-Tale Heart - By Edgar Allan Poe,"TRUE!-NERVOUS--very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am! but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses--not destroyed--not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily--how calmly I can tell you the whole story.  <br><br>  It is impossible to tell how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! Yes, it was this! One of his eyes resembled that of a vulture--a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees--very gradually--I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.  <br><br>  Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded--with what caution--with what foresight--with what dissimulation I went to work!  <br><br>  I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it--oh, so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, so that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly--very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man's sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha!--would a madman have been so wise as this? And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously--oh, so cautiously--cautiously (for the hinges creaked)--I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. And this I did for seven long nights--every night just at midnight--but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he had passed the night. So you see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.  <br><br>  Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch's minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers--of my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled. Now you may think that I drew back--but no. His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness (for the shutters were close fastened, through fear of robbers), and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily.  <br><br>  I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in bed, crying out: ""Who's there?""  <br><br>  I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed listening;--just as I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall.  <br><br>  Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal terror. It was not a groan of pain or grief--oh no!--it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe. I knew the sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not. He had been saying to himself: ""It is nothing but the wind in the chimney--it is only a mouse crossing the floor,"" or ""it is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp."" Yes, he had been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions; but he had found all in vain. All in vain; because Death, in approaching him. had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel--although he neither saw nor heard--to feel the presence of my head within the room.  <br><br>  When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little--a very, very little crevice in the lantern. So I opened it--you cannot imagine how stealthily, stealthily--until, at length, a single dim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and full upon the vulture eye.  <br><br>  It was open--wide, wide open--and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I saw it with perfect distinctness--all a dull blue, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old man's face or person: for I had directed the ray, as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot.  <br><br>  And now--have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over-acuteness of the senses?--now, I say, there came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I knew that sound well too. It was the beating of the old man's heart. It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage.  <br><br>  But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the lantern motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the eye. Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker and quicker' and louder and louder every instant. The old man's terror must have been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every moment!--do you mark me well? I have told you that I am nervous: so I am. And now at the dead hour of night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror. Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still. But the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must burst. And now a new anxiety seized me--the sound would be heard by a neighbor! The old man's hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped into the room. He shrieked once--once only. In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done. But, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man was dead. I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye would trouble me no more.  <br><br>  If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence. First of all I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs.  <br><br>  I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye--not even his--could have detected anything wrong. There was nothing to wash out--no stain of any kind--no blood-spot whatever. I had been too wary for that. A tub had caught all--ha! ha!  <br><br>  When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o'clock--still dark as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door. I went down to open it with a light heart--for what had I now to fear? There entered three men, who introduced themselves, with perfect suavity, as officers of the police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbor during the night: suspicion of foul play had been aroused; information had been lodged at the police office, and they (the officers) had been deputed to search the premises.  <br><br>  I smiled--for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was absent in the country. I took my visitors all over the house. I bade them search--search well. I led them, at length, to his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim.  <br><br>  The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I was singularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they chatted familiar things. But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears: but still they sat and still chatted. The ringing became more distinct:--it continued and became more distinct: I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but it continued and gained definiteness--until, at length, I found that the noise was not within my ears.  <br><br>  No doubt I now grew very pale,--but I talked more fluently, and with a heightened voice. Yet the sound increased--and what could I do? It was a low, dull, quick sound--much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath--and yet the officers heard it not. I talked more quickly--more vehemently; but the noise steadily increased. Why would they not be gone? I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the observation of the men--but the noise steadily increased. Oh, God; what could I do? I foamed--I raved--I swore! I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased. It grew louder--louder --louder! And still the men chatted pleasantly, and smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God!--no, no! They heard!--they suspected--they knew!--they were making a mockery of my horror!--this I thought, and this I think. But anything was better than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die!--and now--again!--hark! louder! louder! louder!  <br><br>  ""Villains!"" I shrieked, ""dissemble no more! I admit the deed!--tear up the planks!--here, here!--it is the beating of his hideous heart!""                              <br><br>"
18,Scarlet Stockings - By Louisa May Alcott,"  <b>Chapter 1  <p>  I. HOW THEY WALKED INTO LENNOX'S LIFE.</b>  <br><br>  I. HOW THEY WALKED INTO LENNOX'S LIFE.<br><br>  ""COME out for a drive, Harry?""  <br><br>  ""Too cold.""  <br><br>  ""Have a game of billiards?""  <br><br>  ""Too tired.""  <br><br>  ""Go and call on the Fairchilds?""  <br><br>  ""Having an unfortunate prejudice against country girls, I respectfully decline.""  <br><br>  ""What will you do then?""  <br><br>  ""Nothing, thank you.""  <br><br>  And settling himself more luxuriously upon the couch, Lennox closed his eyes, and appeared to slumber tranquilly. Kate shook her head, and stood regarding her brother, despondently, till a sudden idea made her turn toward the window, exclaiming abruptly,  <br><br>  ""Scarlet stockings, Harry!""  <br><br>  ""Where?"" and, as if the words were a spell to break the deepest day-dream, Lennox hurried to the window, with an unusual expression of interest in his listless face.  <br><br>  ""I thought that would succeed! She isn't there, but I've got you up, and you are not to go down again,"" laughed Kate, taking possession of the sofa.  <br><br>  ""Not a bad manoeuvre. I don't mind; it's about time for the one interesting event of the day to occur, so I'll watch for myself, thank you,"" and Lennox took the easy chair by the window with a shrug and a yawn.  <br><br>  ""I'm glad any thing does interest you,"" said Kate, petulantly, ""though I don't think it amounts to much, for, though you perch yourself at the window every day to see that girl pass, you don't care enough about it to ask her name.""  <br><br>  ""I've been waiting to be told.""  <br><br>  ""It's Belle Morgan, the Doctor's daughter, and my dearest friend.""  <br><br>  ""Then, of course, she is a blue-belle?""  <br><br>  ""Don't try to be witty or sarcastic with her, for she will beat you at that.""  <br><br>  ""Not a dumb-belle then?""  <br><br>  ""Quite the reverse; she talks a good deal, and very well too, when she likes.""  <br><br>  ""She is very pretty; has anybody the right to call her 'Ma belle'?""  <br><br>  ""Many would be glad to do so, but she won't have any thing to say to them.""  <br><br>  ""A Canterbury belle in every sense of the word then?""  <br><br>  ""She might be, for all Canterbury loves her, but she isn't fashionable, and has more friends among the poor than among the rich.""  <br><br>  ""Ah, I see, a diving-bell, who knows how to go down into a sea of troubles, and bring up the pearls worth having.""  <br><br>  ""I'll tell her that, it will please her. You are really waking up, Harry,"" and Kate smiled approvingly upon him.  <br><br>  ""This page of 'Belle's Life' is rather amusing, so read away,"" said Lennox, glancing up the street, as if he awaited the appearance of the next edition with pleasure.  <br><br>  ""There isn't much to tell; she is a nice, bright, energetic, warm-hearted dear; the pride of the Doctor's heart, and a favorite with every one, though she is odd.  <br><br>  ""How odd?""  <br><br>  ""Does and says what she likes, is very blunt and honest, has ideas and principles of her own, goes to parties in high dresses, won't dance round dances, and wears red stockings, though Mrs. Plantagenet says it's fast.""  <br><br>  ""Rather a jolly little person, I fancy. Why haven't we met her at some of the tea-fights and muffin-worries we've been to lately?""  <br><br>  ""It may make you angry, but it will do you good, so I'll tell. She didn't care enough about seeing the distinguished stranger to come; that's the truth.""  <br><br>  ""Sensible girl, to spare herself hours of mortal dulness, gossip, and dyspepsia,"" was the placid reply.  <br><br>  ""She has seen you, though, at church and dawdling about town, and she called you 'Sir Charles Coldstream' on the spot. How does that suit?"" asked Kate, maliciously.  <br><br>  ""Not bad, I rather like that. Wish she'd call some day, and stir us up.""  <br><br>  ""She won't; I asked her, but she said she was very busy, and told Jessy Tudor, she wasn't fond of peacocks.""  <br><br>  ""I don't exactly see the connection.""  <br><br>  ""Stupid boy! she meant you, of course.""  <br><br>  ""Oh, I'm peacocks, am I?""  <br><br>  ""I don't wish to be rude, but I really do think you are vain of your good looks, elegant accomplishments, and the impression you make wherever you go. When it's worth while you exert yourself, and are altogether fascinating, but the 'I come -- see -- and -- conquer' air you put on, spoils it all for sensible people.""  <br><br>  ""It strikes me that Miss Morgan has slightly infected you with her oddity as far as bluntness goes. Fire away, it's rather amusing to be abused when one is dying of ennui.""  <br><br>  ""That's grateful and complimentary to me, when I have devoted myself to you ever since you came. But every thing bores you, and the only sign of interest you've shown is in those absurd red hose. I should like to know what the charm is,"" said Kate, sharply.  <br><br>  ""Impossible to say; accept the fact calmly as I do, and be grateful that there is one glimpse of color, life, and spirit in this aristocratic tomb of a town.""  <br><br>  ""You are not obliged to stay in it!"" fiercely.  <br><br>  ""Begging your pardon, my dove, but I am. I promised to give you my enlivening society for a month, and a Lennox keeps his word, even at the cost of his life.""  <br><br>  ""I'm sorry I asked such a sacrifice; but I innocently thought that after being away for five long years, you might care to see your orphan sister,"" and the dove produced her handkerchief with a plaintive sniff.  <br><br>  ""Now, my dear creature, don't be melodramatic, I beg of you,"" cried her brother, imploringly. ""I wished to come, I pined to embrace you, and I give you my word, I don't blame you for the stupidity of this confounded place.""  <br><br>  ""It never was so gay as since you came, for every one has tried to make it pleasant for you,"" cried Kate, ruffled at his indifference to the hospitable efforts of herself and friends. ""But you don't care for any of our simple amusements, because you are spoilt by the flattery, gayety, and nonsense of foreign society. If I didn't know it was half affectation, I should be in despair, you are so blase and absurd. It's always the way with men, if one happens to be handsome, accomplished, and talented, he puts on as many airs, and is as vain as any silly girl.""  <br><br>  ""Don't you think if you took breath, you'd get on faster, my dear?"" asked the imperturbable gentleman, as Kate paused with a gasp.  <br><br>  ""I know it's useless for me to talk, as you don't care a straw what I say, but it's true, and some day you'll wish you had done something worth doing all these years. I was so proud of you, so fond of you, that I can't help being disappointed, to find you with no more ambition than to kill time comfortably, no interest in any thing but your own pleasures, and only energy enough to amuse yourself with a pair of scarlet stockings.""  <br><br>  Pathetic as poor Kate's face and voice were, it was impossible to help laughing at the comical conclusion of her lament. Lennox tried to hide the smile on his lips by affecting to curl his moustache with care, and to gaze pensively out as if touched by her appeal. But he wasn't, oh, bless you, no! she was only his sister, and, though she might have talked with the wisdom of Solomon, and the eloquence of Demosthenes, it wouldn't have done a particle of good. Sisters do very well to work for one, to pet one, and play confidante when one's love affairs need feminine wit to conduct them, but when they begin to reprove, or criticise or moralize, it won't do, and can't be allowed, of course. Lennox never snubbed anybody, but blandly extinguished them by a polite acquiescence in all their affirmations, for the time being, and then went on in his own way as if nothing had been said.  <br><br>  ""I dare say you are right; I'll go and think over your very sensible advice,"" and, as if roused to unwonted exertion by the stings of an accusing conscience, he left the room abruptly.  <br><br>  ""I do believe I've made an impression at last! He's actually gone out to think over what I've said. Dear Harry, I was sure he had a heart, if one only knew how to get at it!"" and with a sigh of satisfaction Kate went to the window to behold the ""dear Harry"" going briskly down the street after a pair of scarlet stockings. A spark of anger kindled in her eyes as she watched him, and when he vanished, she still stood knitting her brows in deep thought, for a grand idea was dawning upon her.  <br><br>  It was a dull town; no one could deny that, for everybody was so intensely proper and well-born, that nobody dared to be jolly. All the houses were square, aristocratic mansions with Revolutionary elms in front and spacious coach-houses behind. The knockers had a supercilious perk to their bronze or brass noses, the dandelions on the lawns had a highly connected air, and the very pigs were evidently descended from ""our first families."" Stately dinner-parties, decorous dances, moral picnics, and much tea-pot gossiping were the social resources of the place. Of course, the young people flirted, for that diversion is apparently irradicable even in the ""best society,"" but it was done with a propriety which was edifying to behold.  <br><br>  One can easily imagine that such a starched state of things would not be particularly attractive to a travelled young gentleman like Lennox, who, as Kate very truly said, had been spoilt by the flattery, luxury, and gayety of foreign society. He did his best, but by the end of the first week ennui claimed him for its own, and passive endurance was all that was left him. From perfect despair he was rescued by the scarlet stockings, which went tripping by one day as he stood at the window, planning some means of escape.  <br><br>  A brisk, blithe-faced girl passed in a grey walking suit with a distracting pair of high-heeled boots and glimpses of scarlet at the ankle. Modest, perfectly so, I assure you, were the glimpses, but the feet were so decidedly pretty that one forgot to look at the face appertaining thereunto. It wasn't a remarkably lovely face, but it was a happy, wholesome one, with all sorts of good little dimples in cheek and chin, sunshiny twinkles in the black eyes, and a decided, yet lovable look about the mouth that was quite satisfactory. A busy, bustling little body she seemed to be, for sack-pockets and muff were full of bundles, and the trim boots tripped briskly over the ground, as if the girl's heart were as light as her heels. Somehow this active, pleasant figure seemed to wake up the whole street, and leave a streak of sunshine behind it, for every one nodded as it passed, and the primmest faces relaxed into smiles, which lingered when the girl had gone.  <br><br>  ""Uncommonly pretty feet -- she walks well, which American girls seldom do -- all waddle or prance -- nice face, but the boots are French, and it does my heart good to see 'em.""  <br><br>  Lennox made these observations to himself as the young lady approached, nodded to Kate at another window, gave a quick but comprehensive glance at himself and trotted round the corner, leaving the impression on his mind that a whiff of fresh spring air had blown through the street in spite of the December snow. He didn't trouble himself to ask who it was, but fell into the way of lounging in the bay-window at about three P. M., and watching the grey and scarlet figure pass with its blooming cheeks, bright eyes, and elastic step. Having nothing else to do, he took to petting this new whim, and quite depended on the daily stirring-up which the sight of the energetic damsel gave him. Kate saw it all, but took no notice till the day of the little tiff above recorded; after that she was as soft as a summer sea, and by some clever stroke had Belle Morgan to tea that very week.  <br><br>  Lennox was one of the best tempered fellows in the world, but the ""peacocks"" did rather nettle him because there was some truth in the insinuation; so he took care to put on no airs or try to be fascinating in the presence of Miss Belle. In truth he soon forgot himself entirely, and enjoyed her oddities with a relish, after the prim proprieties of the other young ladies who had simpered and sighed before him. For the first time in his life, the ""Crusher,"" as his male friends called him, got crushed; for Belle, with the subtle skill of a quick-witted, keen-sighted girl, soon saw and condemned the elegant affectations which others called foreign polish. A look, a word, a gesture from a pretty woman is often more eloquent and impressive than moral essays or semi-occasional twinges of conscience, and in the presence of one satirical little person, Sir Charles Coldstream soon ceased to deserve the name.  <br><br>  Belle seemed to get over her hurry and to find time for occasional relaxation, but one never knew in what mood he might find her, for the weathercock was not more changeable than she. Lennox liked that, and found the muffin-worries quite endurable with this sauce piquante to relieve their insipidity. Presently he discovered that he was suffering for exercise, and formed the wholesome habit of promenading the town about three P. M.; Kate said, to follow the scarlet stockings.  <br><br>  <b>Chapter 2  <p>  II. WHERE THEY LED HIM.</b>  <br><br>  II. WHERE THEY LED HIM.<br><br>  ""WHITHER away, Miss Morgan?"" asked Lennox, as he overtook her one bitter cold day.  <br><br>  ""I'm taking my constitutional.""  <br><br>  ""So am I.""  <br><br>  ""With a difference,"" and Belle glanced at the blue-nosed, muffled-up gentleman strolling along beside her with an occasional shiver and shrug.  <br><br>  ""After a winter in the south of France one don't find arctic weather like this easy to bear,"" he said, with a disgusted air.  <br><br>  ""I like it, and do my five or six miles a day, which keeps me in what fine ladies call 'rude health,' answered Belle, walking him on at a pace which soon made his furs a burden.  <br><br>  She was a famous pedestrian, and a little proud of her powers, but she outdid all former feats that day, and got over the ground in gallant style. Something in her manner put her escort on his mettle, and his usual lounge was turned into a brisk march which set his blood dancing, face glowing, and spirits effervescing as they had not done for many a day.  <br><br>  ""There! you look more like your real self now,"" said Belle, with the first sign of approval she had ever vouchsafed him, as he rejoined her after a race to recover her veil, which the wind whisked away over hedge and ditch.  <br><br>  ""Are you sure you know what my real self is?"" he asked, with a touch of the ""conquering hero"" air.  <br><br>  ""Not a doubt of it. I always know a soldier when I see one,"" returned Belle, decidedly.  <br><br>  ""A soldier! that's the last thing I should expect to be accused of,"" and Lennox looked both surprised and gratified.  <br><br>  ""There's a flash in your eye and a ring to your voice, occasionally, which made me suspect that you had fire and energy enough if you only chose to show it, and the spirit with which you have just executed the 'Morgan Quick step' proves that I was right,"" returned Belle, laughing.  <br><br>  ""Then I am not altogether a 'peacock?'"" said Lennox, significantly, for during the chat, which had been as brisk as the walk, Belle had given his besetting sins several sly hits, and he couldn't resist one return shot, much as her unexpected compliment pleased him.  <br><br>  Poor Belle blushed up to her forehead, tried to look as if she did not understand, and gladly hid her confusion behind the recovered veil without a word.  <br><br>  There was a decided display both of the ""flash"" and the ""ring,"" as Lennox looked at the suddenly subdued young lady, and, quite satisfied with his retaliation, gave the order -- ""Forward, march!"" which brought them to the garden-gate breathless, but better friends than before.  <br><br>  The next time the young people met, Belle was in such a hurry that she went round the corner with an abstracted expression which was quite a triumph of art. Just then, off tumbled the lid of the basket she carried, and Lennox, rescuing it from a puddle, obligingly helped readjust it over a funny collection of bottles, dishes, and tidy little rolls of all sorts.  <br><br>  ""It's very heavy, mayn't I carry it for you?"" he asked, in an insinuating manner.  <br><br>  ""No, thank you,"" was on Belle's lips, but observing that he was got up with unusual elegance to pay calls, she couldn't resist the temptation of making a beast of burden of him, and took him at his word.  <br><br>  ""You may, if you like. I've got more bundles to take from the store, and another pair of hands won't come amiss.""  <br><br>  Lennox lifted his eyebrows, also the basket, and they went on again, Belle very much absorbed in her business, and her escort wondering where the dickens she was going with all that rubbish. Filling his unoccupied hand with sundry brown paper parcels, much to the detriment of the light kid that covered it, Belle paraded him down the main street before the windows of the most aristocratic mansions, and then dived into a dirty back-lane, where the want and misery of the town was decorously kept out of sight.  <br><br>  ""You don't mind scarlet fever, I suppose?"" observed Belle, as they approached the unsavory residence of Biddy O'Brien.  <br><br>  ""Well, I'm not exactly partial to it,"" said Lennox, rather taken aback.  <br><br>  ""You needn't go in if you are afraid, or speak to me afterwards, so no harm will be done -- except to your gloves.""  <br><br>  ""Why do you come here, if I may ask? It isn't the sort of amusement I should recommend,"" he began, evidently disapproving of the step.  <br><br>  ""Oh, I'm used to it, and like to play nurse where father plays doctor. I'm fond of children, and Mrs. O'Brien's are little dears,"" returned Belle, briskly, threading her way between ash-heaps and mud-puddles as if bound to a festive scene.  <br><br>  ""Judging from the row in there, I should infer that Mrs. O'Brien had quite a herd of little dears.""  <br><br>  ""Only nine.""  <br><br>  ""And all sick?""  <br><br>  ""More or less.""  <br><br>  ""By Jove! it's perfectly heroic in you to visit this hole in spite of dirt, noise, fragrance, and infection,"" cried Lennox, who devoutly wished that the sense of smell if not of hearing were temporarily denied him.  <br><br>  ""Bless you, it's the sort of thing I enjoy, for there's no nonsense here; the work you do is pleasant if you do it heartily, and the thanks you get are worth having, I assure you.""  <br><br>  She put out her hand to relieve him of the basket, but he gave it an approving little shake, and said briefly --  <br><br>  ""Not yet, I'm coming in.""  <br><br>  It's all very well to rhapsodize about the exquisite pleasure of doing good, to give carelessly of one's abundance, and enjoy the delusion of having remembered the poor. But it is a cheap charity, and never brings the genuine satisfaction which those know who give their mite with heart as well as hand, and truly love their neighbor as themselves. Lennox had seen much fashionable benevolence, and laughed at it even while he imitated it, giving generously when it wasn't inconvenient. But this was a new sort of thing entirely, and in spite of the dirt, the noise, and the smells, he forgot the fever, and was glad he came when poor Mrs. O'Brien turned from her sick babies, exclaiming, with Irish fervor at sight of Belle,  <br><br>  ""The Lord love ye, darlin, for remimberin us when ivery one, barrin' the doctor, and the praste, turns the cowld shouldther in our throuble!""  <br><br>  ""Now if you really want to help, just keep this child quiet while I see to the sickest ones,"" said Belle, dumping a stout infant on to his knee, thrusting an orange into his hand, and leaving him aghast, while she unpacked her little messes, and comforted the maternal bird.  <br><br>  With the calmness of desperation, her aid-de-camp put down his best beaver on the rich soil which covered the floor, pocketed his Paris kids, and making a bib of his cambric handkerchief, gagged young Pat deliciously with bits of orange whenever he opened his mouth to roar. At her first leisure moment, Belle glanced at him to see how he was getting on, and found him so solemnly absorbed in his task that she went off into a burst of such infectious merriment that the O'Briens, sick and well, joined in it to a man.  <br><br>  ""Good fun, isn't it?"" she asked, turning down her cuffs when the last spoonful of gruel was administered.  <br><br>  ""I've no doubt of it, when one is used to the thing. It comes a little hard at first, you know,"" returned Lennox, wiping his forehead, with a long breath, and seizing his hat as if quite ready to tear himself away.  <br><br>  ""You've done very well for a beginner; so kiss the baby and come home,"" said Belle approvingly.  <br><br>  ""No, thank you,"" muttered Lennox, trying to detach the bedaubed innocent. But little Pat had a grateful heart, and falling upon his new nurse's neck with a rapturous crow clung there like a burr.  <br><br>  ""Take him off! Let me out of this! He's one too many for me!"" cried the wretched young man in comic despair.  <br><br>  Being freed with much laughter, he turned and fled, followed by a shower of blessings, from Mrs. O'Brien.  <br><br>  As they came up again into the pleasant highways, Lennox said, awkwardly for him,  <br><br>  ""The thanks of the poor are excellent things to have, but I think I'd rather receive them by proxy. Will you kindly spend this for me in making that poor soul comfortable?""  <br><br>  But Belle wouldn't take what he offered her, she put it back, saying earnestly,  <br><br>  ""Give it yourself; one can't buy blessings, they must be earned or they are not worth having. Try it, please, and if you find it a failure, then I'll gladly be your almoner.""  <br><br>  There was a significance in her words which he could not fail to understand. He neither shrugged, drawled, nor sauntered now, but gave her a look in which respect and self-reproach were mingled, and left her, simply saying, ""I'll try it, Miss Morgan.""  <br><br>  ""Now isn't she odd?"" whispered Kate to her brother, as Belle appeared at a little dance at Mrs. Plantagenet's in a high-necked dress, knitting away on an army-sock, as she greeted the friends who crowded round her.  <br><br>  ""Charmingly so. Why don't you do that sort of thing when you can?"" answered her brother, glancing at her thin, bare shoulders and hands, rendered nearly useless by the tightness of the gloves.  <br><br>  ""Gracious, no! It's natural to her to do so, and she carries it off well; I couldn't, therefore I don't try, though I admire it in her. Go and ask her to dance, before she is engaged.""  <br><br>  ""She doesn't dance round dances you know.""  <br><br>  ""She is dreadfully prim about some things and so free and easy about others, I can't understand it, do you?""  <br><br>  ""Well, yes, I think I do. Here's Forbes coming for you, I'll go and entertain Belle by a quarrel.""  <br><br>  He found her in a recess out of the way of the rushing and romping, busy with her work, yet evidently glad to be amused.  <br><br>  ""I admire your adherence to principles, Miss Belle, but don't you find it a little hard to sit still while your friends are enjoying themselves?"" he asked, sinking luxuriously into the lounging chair beside her.  <br><br>  ""Yes, very,"" answered Belle with characteristic candor. ""But father don't approve of that sort of exercise, so I console myself with something useful till my chance comes.""  <br><br>  ""Your work can't exactly be called ornamental,"" said Lennox, looking at the big sock.  <br><br>  ""Don't laugh at it, sir, it is for the foot of the brave fellow who is going to fight for me and his country.""  <br><br>  ""Happy fellow! May I ask who he is?"" and Lennox sat up with an air of interest.  <br><br>  ""My substitute; I don't know his name, for father has not got him yet, but I'm making socks, and towels, and a comfort-bag for him, so that when found he may be off at once.""  <br><br>  ""You really mean it?"" cried Lennox.  <br><br>  ""O course I do; I can't go myself, but I can buy a pair of strong arms to fight for me, and I intend to do it. I only hope he'll have the right sort of courage and be a credit to me.""  <br><br>  ""What do you call the right sort of courage?"" asked Lennox, soberly.  <br><br>  ""That which makes a man ready and glad to live or die for a principle. There's a chance for heroes now, if there ever was. When do you join your regiment?"" she added abruptly.  <br><br>  ""Haven't the least idea,"" and Lennox subsided again.  <br><br>  ""But you intend to do so, of course?""  <br><br>  ""Why should I?""  <br><br>  Belle dropped her work. ""Why should you? What a question! Because you have health, and strength, and courage, and money to help on the good cause, and every man should give his best, and not dare to stay at home when he is needed.""  <br><br>  ""You forget that I am an Englishman, and we rather prefer to be strictly neutral just now.""  <br><br>  ""You are only half English, and for your mother's sake you should be proud and glad to fight for the North,"" cried Belle warmly.  <br><br>  ""I don't remember my mother -- ""  <br><br>  ""That's evident!""  <br><br>  ""But I was about to add, I've no objection to lend a hand if it isn't too much trouble to get off,"" said Lennox indifferently, for he liked to see Belle's color rise, and her eyes kindle while he provoked her.  <br><br>  ""Do you expect to go South in a bandbox? You'd better join one of the kid-glove regiments, they say the dandies fight well when the time comes.""  <br><br>  ""I've been away so long, the patriotic fever hasn't seized me yet, and as the quarrel is none of mine, I think, perhaps I'd better take care of Kate, and let you fight it out among yourselves. Here's the Lancers, may I have the honor?""  <br><br>  But Belle, being very angry at this lukewarmness, answered in her bluntest manner.  <br><br>  ""Having reminded me that you are a 'strictly neutral' Englishman, you must excuse me if I decline; I dance only with loyal Americans,"" and rolling up her work with a defiant flourish, she walked away, leaving him to lament his loss and wonder how he could retrieve it. She did not speak to him again till he stood in the hall waiting for Kate, then Belle came down in the charming little red hood, and going straight up to him with her hand out, a repentant look, and a friendly smile, said frankly --  <br><br>  ""I was very rude; I want to beg pardon of the English, and shake hands with the American half.""  <br><br>  So peace was declared, and lasted unbroken for the remaining week of his stay, when he proposed to take Kate to the city for a little gayety. Miss Morgan openly approved the plan, but secretly felt as if the town was about to be depopulated, and tried to hide her melancholy in her substitute's socks. They were not large enough, however, to absorb it all, and when Lennox went to make his adieu, it was perfectly evident that the Doctor's Belle was out of tune. The young gentleman basely exulted over this, till she gave him something else to think about by saying gravely,  <br><br>  ""Before you go, I feel as if I ought to tell you something, since Kate won't. If you are offended about it please don't blame her; she meant it kindly and so did I."" Belle paused as if it was not an easy thing to tell, and then went on quickly, with her eyes upon her work.  <br><br>  ""Three weeks ago Kate asked me to help her in a little plot, and I consented, for the fun of the thing. She wanted something to amuse and stir you up, and finding that my queer ways diverted you, she begged me to be neighborly and let you do what you liked. I didn't care particularly about amusing you, but I did think you needed rousing, so for her sake I tried to do it, and you very good-naturedly bore my lecturing. I don't like deceit of any kind, so I confess, but I can't say I'm sorry, for I really think you are none the worse for the teasing and teaching you've had.""  <br><br>  Belle didn't see him flush and frown as she made her confession, and when she looked up he only said, half gratefully, half reproachfully,  <br><br>  ""I'm a good deal the better for it, I dare say, and ought to be very thankful for your friendly exertions. But two against one was hardly fair, now was it?""  <br><br>  ""No, it was sly and sinful in the highest degree, but we did it for your good, so I know you'll forgive us, and as a proof of it sing one or two of my favorites for the last time.""  <br><br>  ""You don't deserve any favor, but I'll do it to show you how much more magnanimous men are than women.""  <br><br>  Not at all loth to improve his advantages, Lennox warbled his most melting lays con amore, watching, as he sung, for any sign of sentiment in the girlish face opposite. But Belle wouldn't be sentimental; and sat rattling her knitting-needles industriously, though ""The Harbor Bar was Moaning,"" dolefully, though ""Douglas"" was touchingly ""tender and true,"" and the ""Wind of the Summer Night"" sighed romantically through the sitting-room.  <br><br>  ""Much obliged. Must you go?"" she said, without a sign of soft confusion as he rose.  <br><br>  ""I must, but I shall come again before I leave the country. May I?"" he asked, holding her hand.  <br><br>  ""If you come in a uniform.""  <br><br>  ""Good night, Belle,"" tenderly. ""Good-bye, Sir Charles,"" with a wicked twinkle of the eye, which lasted till he closed the hall-door, growling irefully,  <br><br>  ""I thought I'd had some experience, but one never can understand these women.""  <br><br>  Canterbury did become a desert to Belle after her dear friend had gone; (of course the dear friend's brother had nothing to do with the desolation), and as the weeks dragged slowly, Belle took to reading poetry, practicing plaintive ballads, and dawdling over her work at a certain window which commanded a view of the railway station and hotel.  <br><br>  ""You're dull, my dear, run up to town with me to-morrow, and see your young man off,"" said the Doctor, one evening as Belle sat musing with a half-mended red stocking in her hand.  <br><br>  ""My young man?"" she ejaculated, turning with a start and a blush.  <br><br>  ""Your substitute, child. Stephens attended to the business for me, and he's off to-morrow. I began to tell you about the fellow last week, but you were wool-gathering, so I stopped.""  <br><br>  ""Yes, I remember, it was all very nice. Goes to-morrow, does he? I'd like to see him, but do you think we can both leave home at once? Some one might come you know, and I fancy it's going to snow,"" said Belle, putting her face behind the curtain to inspect the weather.  <br><br>  ""You'd better go, the trip will do you good, you can take your things to Tom Jones, and see Kate on the way; she's got back from Philadelphia.""  <br><br>  ""Has she! I'll go, then; it will please her, and I do need change. You are an old dear, to think of it;"" and giving her father a hasty glimpse of a suddenly excited countenance, Belle slipped out of the room to prepare her best array with a most reckless disregard of the impending storm.  <br><br>  It didn't snow on the morrow, and up they went to see the -- th regiment off. Belle did not see ""her young man,"" however, for while her father went to carry him her comforts and a patriotic nosegay of red and white flowers, tied up with a smart blue ribbon, she called on Kate. But Miss Lennox was engaged, and sent an urgent request that her friend would call in the afternoon. Much disappointed and a little hurt, Belle then devoted herself to the departing regiment, wishing she was going with it, for she felt in a war-like mood. It was past noon when a burst of martial music, the measured tramp of many feet, and enthusiastic cheers announced that ""the boys"" were coming. From the balcony where she stood with her father, Belle looked down upon the living stream that flowed by like a broad river with a steely glitter above the blue. All her petty troubles vanished at the sight, her heart beat high, her face glowed, her eyes filled, and she waved her hat as zealously as if she had a dozen friends and lovers in the ranks below.  <br><br>  ""Here comes your man; I told him to stick the posy where it would catch my eye, so I could point him out to you. Look, it's the tall fellow at the end of the front line,"" said the Doctor in an excited tone, as he pointed and beckoned.  <br><br>  Belle looked and gave a little cry, for there, in a private's uniform, with her nosegay at his buttonhole, and on his face a smile she never forgot, was Lennox! For an instant she stood staring at him as pale and startled as if he were a ghost, then the color rushed into her face, she kissed both hands to him, and cried bravely, ""Good-bye, good-bye, God bless you, Harry!"" and immediately laid her head on her father's shoulder, sobbing as if her heart was broken.  <br><br>  When she looked up, her substitute was lost in the undulating mass below, and for her the spectacle was over.  <br><br>  ""Was it really he? Why wasn't I told? What does it all mean?"" she demanded, looking bewildered, grieved, and ashamed.  <br><br>  ""He's really gone, my dear. It's a surprise of his, and I was bound over to silence. Here, this will explain the joke, I suppose,"" and the Doctor handed her a cocked-hat note, done up like a military order.  <br><br>  ""A Roland for your Oliver, Mademoiselle! I came home for the express purpose of enlisting, and only delayed a month on Kate's account. If I ever return, I will receive my bounty at your hands. Till then please comfort Kate, think as kindly as you can of 'Sir Charles,' and sometimes pray a little prayer for  <br><br>  ""Your unworthy  <br><br>  ""Substitute.""  <br><br>  Belle looked very pale and meek when she put her note in her pocket, but she only said, ""I must go and comfort Kate,"" and the Doctor gladly obeyed, feeling that the joke was more serious than he had imagined.  <br><br>  The moment her friend appeared, Miss Lennox turned on her tears, and ""played away"" pouring forth lamentations, reproaches, and regrets in a steady stream.  <br><br>  ""I hope you are satisfied now, you cruel girl!"" she began, refusing to be kissed. ""You've sent him off with a broken heart to rush into danger and be shot, or get his arms and legs spoilt. You know he loved you and wanted to tell you so, but you wouldn't let him, and now you've driven him away, and he's gone as an insignificant private with his head shaved, and a heavy knapsack breaking his back, and a horrid gun that will be sure to explode, and he would wear those immense blue socks you sent, for he adores you, and you only teased and laughed at him, my poor deluded, deserted brother!"" And quite overwhelmed by the afflicting picture, Kate lifted up her voice and wept again.  <br><br>  ""I am satisfied; for he's done what I hoped he would, and he's none the less a gentleman because he's a private and wears my socks. I pray they will keep him safe and bring him home to us when he has done his duty like a man, as I know he will. I'm proud of my brave substitute, and I'll try to be worthy of him,"" cried Belle, kindling beautifully as she looked out into the wintry sunshine with a new softness in the eyes that still seemed watching that blue-coated figure marching away to danger, perhaps death.  <br><br>  ""It's ill playing with edged tools; we meant to amuse him and we may have sent him to destruction. I'll never forgive you for your part, never!"" said Kate, with the charming inconsistency of her sex.  <br><br>  But Belle turned away her wrath by a soft answer, as she whispered, with a tender choke in her voice,  <br><br>  ""We both loved him, dear; let's comfort one another.""  <br><br>  <b>Chapter 3  <p>  III. WHAT BECAME OF THEM.</b>  <br><br>  III. WHAT BECAME OF THEM.<br><br>  PRIVATE Lennox certainly had chosen pretty hard work, for the -- th was not a ""kid-glove"" regiment by any means; fighting in mid-winter was not exactly festive, and camps do not abound in beds of roses even at the best of times. But Belle was right in saying she knew a soldier when she saw him, for now that he was thoroughly waked up, he proved that there was plenty of courage, energy, and endurance in him.  <br><br>  It's my private opinion that he might now and then have slightly regretted the step he had taken, had it not been for certain recollections of a sarcastic tongue and a pair of keen eyes, not to mention the influence of one of the most potent rulers of the human heart, namely, the desire to prove himself worthy of the respect, if nothing more, of somebody at home. Belle's socks did seem to keep him safe, and lead him straight in the narrow path of duty. Belle's comfort-bag was such in very truth, for not one of the stout needles on the tricolored cushion but what seemed to wink its eye approvingly at him; not one of the tidy balls of thread that did not remind him of the little hand he coveted, and the impracticable scissors, were cherished as a good omen, though he felt that the sharpest steel that ever came from Sheffield couldn't cut his love in twain. And Belle's lessons, short as they had been, were not forgotten, but seemed to have been taken up by a sterner mistress, whose rewards were greater if not so sweet as those the girl could give. There was plenty of exercise now-a-days of hard work that left many a tired head asleep forever under the snow. There were many opportunities for diving ""into the depths and bringing up pearls worth having"" by acts of kindness among the weak, the wicked, and the suffering all about him. He learned now how to earn, not buy, the thanks of the poor, and unconsciously proved in the truest way that a private could be a gentleman. But best of all was the steadfast purpose ""to live and die for a principle,"" which grew and strengthened with each month of bitter hardship, bloody strife, and dearly-bought success. Life grew earnest to him, time seemed precious, self was forgotten, and all that was best and bravest rallied round the flag on which his heart inscribed the motto, ""Love and Liberty.""  <br><br>  Praise and honor he could not fail to win, and had he never gone back to claim his bounty he would have earned the great ""Well done,"" for he kept his oath loyally, did his duty manfully, and loved his lady faithfully, like a knight of the chivalrous times. He knew nothing of her secret, but wore her blue ribbon like an order, never went into battle without first, like many another poor fellow, kissing something which he carried next his heart, and with each day of absence felt himself a better man, and braver soldier, for the fondly foolish romance he had woven about the scarlet stockings.  <br><br>  Belle and Kate did comfort one another, not only with tears and kisses, but with womanly work which kept hearts happy and hands busy. How Belle bribed her to silence will always remain the ninth wonder of the world, but though reams of paper passed between brother and sister during those twelve months not a hint was dropped on one side in reply to artful inquiries from the other. Belle never told her love in words, but she stowed away an unlimited quantity of the article in the big boxes that went to gladden the eyes and -- alas for romance! -- the stomach of Private Lennox. If pickles could typify passion, cigars prove constancy, and gingerbread reveal the longings of the soul, then would the above-mentioned gentleman have been the happiest of lovers. But camp-life had doubtless dulled his finer intuitions, for he failed to understand the new language of love, and gave away these tender tokens with lavish prodigality. Concealment preyed a trifle on Belle's damask cheek it must be confessed, and the keen eyes grew softer with the secret tears that sometimes dimmed them; the sharp tongue seldom did mischief now, but uttered kindly words to every one as if doing penance for the past, and a sweet seriousness toned down the lively spirit which was learning many things in the sleepless nights that followed when the ""little prayer"" for the beloved substitute was done.  <br><br>  ""I'll wait and see if he is all I hope he will be, before I let him know. I shall read the truth the instant I see him, and if he has stood the test I'll run into his arms and tell him everything,"" she said to herself with delicious thrills at the idea; but you may be sure she did nothing of the sort when the time came.  <br><br>  A rumor flew through the town one day that Lennox had arrived; upon receipt of which joyful tidings Belle had a panic and hid herself in the garret. But when she had quaked, and cried, and peeped, and listened for an hour or two, finding that no one came to hunt her up, she composed her nerves and descended to pass the afternoon in the parlor and a high state of dignity. All sorts of reports reached her -- he was mortally wounded, he had been made a major or a colonel, or a general, no one knew exactly which; he was dead, was going to be married, and hadn't come at all. Belle fully expiated all her small sins by the agonies of suspense she suffered that day, and when at last a note came from Kate begging her ""to drop over to see Harry,"" she put her pride in her pocket and went at once.  <br><br>  The drawing-room was empty and in confusion, there was a murmur of voices up-stairs, a smell of camphor in the air, and an empty wine-glass on the table where a military cap was lying. Belle's heart sunk, and she covertly kissed the faded blue coat as she stood waiting breathlessly, wondering if Harry had any arms for her to run into. She heard the chuckling Biddy lumber up and announce her, then a laugh and a half fond, half exulting -- ""Ah, ha, I thought she'd come!""  <br><br>  That spoilt it all; Belle took out her pride instanter, set her teeth, rubbed a quick color into her white cheeks, and snatching up a newspaper, sat herself down with as expressionless a face as it was possible for an excited young woman to possess. Lennox came running down -- ""Thank heaven, his legs are safe!"" sighed Belle, with her eyes glued to the price of beef. He entered with both hands extended, which relieved her mind upon another point, and he beamed upon her, looking so vigorous, manly, and martial that she cried within herself, ""My beautiful brown soldier!"" even while she greeted him with an unnecessarily brief ""How do you do, Mr. Lennox?""  <br><br>  The sudden eclipse which passed over his joyful countenance would have been ludicrous if it hadn't been pathetic; but he was used to hard knocks now, and bore this, his hardest, like a man. He shook hands heartily, and as Belle sat down again (not to betray that she was trembling a good deal), he stood at ease before her, talking in a way which soon satisfied her that he had borne the test, and that bliss was waiting for her round the corner. But she had made it such a very sharp corner she couldn't turn it gracefully, and while she pondered how to do so he helped her with a cough. She looked up quickly, discovering all at once that he was very thin, rather pale in spite of the nice tan, and breathed hurriedly as he stood with one hand in his breast.  <br><br>  ""Are you ill, wounded, in pain?"" she asked, forgetting herself entirely.  <br><br>  ""Yes, all three,"" he answered, after a curious look at her changing color and anxious eyes.  <br><br>  ""Sit down -- tell me about it -- can I do any thing?"" and Belle began to plump up the pillows on the couch with nervous eagerness.  <br><br>  ""Thank you, I'm past help,"" was the mournful reply, accompanied by a hollow cough which made her shiver.  <br><br>  ""Oh, don't say so! Let me bring father; he is very skilful. Shall I call Kate?""  <br><br>  ""He can do nothing; Kate doesn't know this, and I beg you won't tell her. I got a shot in the breast and made light of it, but it will finish me sooner or later. I don't mind telling you, for you are one of the strong, cool sort, you know, and are not affected by such things. But Kate is so fond of me, I don't want to shock and trouble her yet awhile. Let her enjoy my little visit, and after I'm gone you can tell her the truth.""  <br><br>  Belle had sat like a statue while he spoke with frequent pauses and an involuntary clutch or two at the suffering breast. As he stopped and passed his hand over his eyes, she said slowly, as if her white lips were stiff,  <br><br>  ""Gone! where?""  <br><br>  ""Back to my place. I'd rather die fighting than fussed and wailed over by a parcel of women. I expected to stay a week or so, but a battle is coming off sooner than we imagined, so I'm away again to-morrow. As I'm not likely ever to come back, I just wanted to ask you to stand by poor Kate when I'm finished, and to say good-bye to you, Belle, before I go."" He put out his hand, but holding it fast in both her own, she laid her tearful face down on it, whispering imploringly,  <br><br>  ""Oh, Harry, stay!""  <br><br>  Never mind what happened for the next ten minutes; suffice it to say that the enemy having surrendered, the victor took possession with great jubilation and showed no quarter.  <br><br>  ""Bang the field piece, toot the fife, and beat the rolling drum, for ruse number three has succeeded! Come down, Kate, and give us your blessing,"" called Lennox, taking pity on his sister, who was anxiously awaiting the denouement on the stairs.  <br><br>  In she rushed, and the young ladies laughed and cried, kissed and talked tumultuously, while their idol benignantly looked on, vainly endeavoring to repress all vestiges of unmanly emotion.  <br><br>  ""And you are not dying, really, truly?"" cried Belle, when fair weather set in after the flurry.  <br><br>  ""Bless your dear heart, no! I'm as sound as a nut, and haven't a wound to boast of, except this ugly slash on the head.""  <br><br>  ""It's a splendid wound, and I'm proud of it,"" and Belle set a rosy little seal on the scar which quite reconciled her lover to the disfigurement of his handsome forehead. ""You've learned to fib in the army, and I'm disappointed in you,"" she added, trying to look reproachful and failing entirely.  <br><br>  ""No, only the art of strategy. You quenched me by your frosty reception, and I thought it was all up till you put the idea of playing invalid into my head. It succeeded so well that I piled on the agony, resolving to fight it out on that line, and if I failed again to make a masterly retreat. You gave me a lesson in deceit once, so don't complain if I turned the tables and made your heart ache for a minute, as you've made mine for a year.""  <br><br>  Belle's spirit was rapidly coming back, so she gave him a capital imitation of his French shrug, and drawled out in his old way --  <br><br>  ""I have my doubts about that, mon ami.""  <br><br>  ""What do you say to this -- and this -- and this?"" he retorted, pulling out and laying before her with a triumphant flourish, a faded blue ribbon, a fat pincushion with a hole through it, and a dainty-painted little picture of a pretty girl in scarlet stockings.  <br><br>  ""There, I've carried those treasures in my breast-pocket for a year, and I'm firmly convinced that they have all done their part toward keeping me safe. The blue ribbon bound me fast to you, Belle; the funny cushion caught the bullet that otherwise might have finished me, and the blessed little picture was my comfort during those dreadful marches, my companion on picket-duty with treachery and danger all about me, and my inspiration when the word 'Charge!' went down the line, for in the thickest of the fight I always saw the little grey figure beckoning me on to my duty.""  <br><br>  ""Oh, Harry, you won't go back to all those horrors, will you? I'm sure you've done enough, and may rest now and enjoy your reward,"" said Kate, trying not to feel that ""two is company and three is none.""  <br><br>  ""I've enlisted for the war, and shall not rest till either it or I come to an end. As for my reward, I had it when Belle kissed me.""  <br><br>  ""You are right, I'll wait for you, and love you all the better for the sacrifice,"" whispered Belle. ""I only wish I could share your hardships, dear, for while you fight and suffer I can only love and pray.""  <br><br>  ""Waiting is harder than working to such as you, so be contented with your share, for the thought of you will glorify the world generally for me. I'll tell you what you can do while I'm away; it's both useful and amusing, so it will occupy and cheer you capitally. Just knit lots of red hose, because I don't intend you to wear any others hereafter, Mrs. Lennox.""  <br><br>  ""Mine are not worn out yet,"" laughed Belle, getting merry at the thought.  <br><br>  ""No matter for that, those are sacred articles, and henceforth must be treasured as memorials of our love. Frame and hang 'em up; or, if the prejudices of society forbid that flight of romance, lay them carefully away where moths can't devour nor thieves steal 'em, so that years hence, when my descendants praise me for any virtues I may possess, any good I may have done, or any honor I may have earned, I can point to those precious relics and say proudly,  <br><br>  ""My children, for all that I am, or hope to be, you must thank your honored mother's scarlet stockings.""                                    <br><br>"
19,An Angel In Disguise - By T.S. Arthur,"Idleness, vice, and intemperance had done their miserable work, and  the dead mother lay cold and still amid her wretched children. She  had fallen upon the threshold of her own door in a drunken fit, and  died in the presence of her frightened little ones.<br><br>    Death touches the spring of our common humanity. This woman had been  despised, scoffed at, and angrily denounced by nearly every man,  woman, and child in the village; but now, as the fact of her death  was passed from lip to lip, in subdued tones, pity took the place of  anger, and sorrow of denunciation. Neighbors went hastily to the old  tumble-down hut, in which she had secured little more than a place  of shelter from summer heats and winter cold: some with  grave-clothes for a decent interment of the body; and some with food  for the half-starving children, three in number. Of these, John, the  oldest, a boy of twelve, was a stout lad, able to earn his living  with any farmer. Kate, between ten and eleven, was bright, active  girl, out of whom something clever might be made, if in good hands;  but poor little Maggie, the youngest, was hopelessly diseased. Two  years before a fall from a window had injured her spine, and she had  not been able to leave her bed since, except when lifted in the arms  of her mother.<br><br>    ""What is to be done with the children?"" That was the chief question  now. The dead mother would go underground, and be forever beyond all  care or concern of the villagers. But the children must not be left  to starve. After considering the matter, and talking it over with  his wife, farmer Jones said that he would take John, and do well by  him, now that his mother was out of the way; and Mrs. Ellis, who had  been looking out for a bound girl, concluded that it would be  charitable in her to make choice of Katy, even though she was too  young to be of much use for several years.<br><br>    ""I could do much better, I know,"" said Mrs. Ellis; ""but as no one  seems inclined to take her, I must act from a sense of duty expect  to have trouble with the child; for she's an undisciplined  thing--used to having her own way.""<br><br>    But no one said ""I'll take Maggie."" Pitying glances were cast on her  wan and wasted form and thoughts were troubled on her account.  Mothers brought cast-off garments and, removing her soiled and  ragged clothes, dressed her in clean attire. The sad eyes and  patient face of the little one touched many hearts, and even knocked  at them for entrance. But none opened to take her in. Who wanted a  bed-ridden child?<br><br>    ""Take her to the poorhouse,"" said a rough man, of whom the question  ""What's to be done with Maggie?"" was asked. ""Nobody's going to be  bothered with her.""<br><br>    ""The poorhouse is a sad place for a sick and helpless child,""  answered one.<br><br>    ""For your child or mine,"" said the other, lightly speaking; ""but for  tis brat it will prove a blessed change, she will be kept clean,  have healthy food, and be doctored, which is more than can be said  of her past condition.""<br><br>    There was reason in that, but still it didn't satisfy. The day  following the day of death was made the day of burial. A few  neighbors were at the miserable hovel, but none followed dead cart  as it bore the unhonored remains to its pauper grave. Farmer Jones,  after the coffin was taken out, placed John in his wagon and drove  away, satisfied that he had done his part. Mrs. Ellis spoke to Kate  with a hurried air, ""Bid your sister good by,"" and drew the tearful  children apart ere scarcely their lips had touched in a sobbing  farewell. Hastily others went out, some glancing at Maggie, and some  resolutely refraining from a look, until all had gone. She was  alone! Just beyond the threshold Joe Thompson, the wheelwright,  paused, and said to the blacksmith's wife, who was hastening off  with the rest,--<br><br>    ""It's a cruel thing to leave her so.""<br><br>    ""Then take her to the poorhouse: she'll have to go there,"" answered  the blacksmith's wife, springing away, and leaving Joe behind.<br><br>    For a little while the man stood with a puzzled air; then he turned  back, and went into the hovel again. Maggie with painful effort, had  raised herself to an upright position and was sitting on the bed,  straining her eyes upon the door out of which all had just departed,  A vague terror had come into her thin white face.<br><br>    ""O, Mr. Thompson!"" she cried out, catching her suspended breath,  ""don't leave me here all alone!""<br><br>    Though rough in exterior, Joe Thompson, the wheelwright, had a  heart, and it was very tender in some places. He liked children, and  was pleased to have them come to his shop, where sleds and wagons  were made or mended for the village lads without a draft on their  hoarded sixpences.<br><br>    ""No, dear,"" he answered, in a kind voice, going to the bed, and  stooping down over the child, ""You sha'n't be left here alone."" Then  he wrapped her with the gentleness almost of a woman, in the clean  bedclothes which some neighbor had brought; and, lifting her in his  strong arms, bore her out into the air and across the field that lay  between the hovel and his home.<br><br>    Now, Joe Thompson's wife, who happened to be childless, was not a  woman of saintly temper, nor much given to self-denial for others'  good, and Joe had well-grounded doubts touching the manner of  greeting he should receive on his arrival. Mrs. Thompson saw him  approaching from the window, and with ruffling feathers met him a  few paces from the door, as he opened the garden gate, and came in.  He bore a precious burden, and he felt it to be so. As his arms held  the sick child to his breast, a sphere of tenderness went out from  her, and penetrated his feelings. A bond had already corded itself  around them both, and love was springing into life.<br><br>    ""What have you there?"" sharply questioned Mrs. Thompson.<br><br>    Joe, felt the child start and shrink against him. He did not reply,  except by a look that was pleading and cautionary, that said, ""Wait  a moment for explanations, and be gentle;"" and, passing in, carried  Maggie to the small chamber on the first floor, and laid her on a  bed. Then, stepping back, he shut the door, and stood face to face  with his vinegar-tempered wife in the passage-way outside.<br><br>    ""You haven't brought home that sick brat!"" Anger and astonishment  were in the tones of Mrs. Joe Thompson; her face was in a flame.<br><br>    ""I think women's hearts are sometimes very hard,"" said Joe. Usually  Joe Thompson got out of his wife's way, or kept rigidly silent and  non-combative when she fired up on any subject; it was with some  surprise, therefore, that she now encountered a firmly-set  countenance and a resolute pair of eyes.<br><br>    ""Women's hearts are not half so hard as men's!""<br><br>    Joe saw, by a quick intuition, that his resolute bearing had  impressed his wife and he answered quickly, and with real  indignation, ""Be that as it may, every woman at the funeral turned  her eyes steadily from the sick child's face, and when the cart went  off with her dead mother, hurried away, and left her alone in that  old hut, with the sun not an hour in the sky.""<br><br>    ""Where were John and Kate?"" asked Mrs. Thompson.<br><br>    ""Farmer Jones tossed John into his wagon, and drove off. Katie went  home with Mrs. Ellis; but nobody wanted the poor sick one. 'Send her  to the poorhouse,' was the cry.""<br><br>    ""Why didn't you let her go, then. What did you bring her here for?""<br><br>    ""She can't walk to the poorhouse,"" said Joe; ""somebody's arms must  carry her, and mine are strong enough for that task.""<br><br>    ""Then why didn't you keep on? Why did you stop here?"" demanded the  wife.<br><br>    ""Because I'm not apt to go on fools' errands. The Guardians must  first be seen, and a permit obtained.""<br><br>    There was no gainsaying this.<br><br>    ""When will you see the Guardians?"" was asked, with irrepressible  impatience.<br><br>    ""To-morrow.""<br><br>    ""Why put it off till to-morrow? Go at once for the permit, and get  the whole thing off of your hands to-night.""<br><br>    ""Jane,"" said the wheelwright, with an impressiveness of tone that  greatly subdued his wife, ""I read in the Bible sometimes, and find  much said about little children. How the Savior rebuked the  disciples who would not receive them; how he took them up in his  arms, and blessed them; and how he said that 'whosoever gave them  even a cup of cold water should not go unrewarded.' Now, it is a  small thing for us to keep this poor motherless little one for a  single night; to be kind to her for a single night; to make her life  comfortable for a single night.""<br><br>    The voice of the strong, rough man shook, and he turned his head  away, so that the moisture in his eyes might not be seen. Mrs.  Thompson did not answer, but a soft feeling crept into her heart.<br><br>    ""Look at her kindly, Jane; speak to her kindly,"" said Joe. ""Think of  her dead mother, and the loneliness, the pain, the sorrow that must  be on all her coming life."" The softness of his heart gave unwonted  eloquence to his lips.<br><br>    Mrs. Thompson did not reply, but presently turned towards the little  chamber where her husband had deposited Maggie; and, pushing open  the door, went quietly in. Joe did not follow; he saw that, her  state had changed, and felt that it would be best to leave her alone  with the child. So he went to his shop, which stood near the house,  and worked until dusky evening released him from labor. A light  shining through the little chamber windows was the first object that  attracted Joe's attention on turning towards the house: it was a  good omen. The path led him by this windows and, when opposite, he  could not help pausing to look in. It was now dark enough outside to  screen him from observation. Maggie lay, a little raised on the  pillow with the lamp shining full upon her face. Mrs. Thompson was  sitting by the bed, talking to the child; but her back was towards  the window, so that her countenance was not seen. From Maggie's  face, therefore, Joe must read the character of their intercourse.  He saw that her eyes were intently fixed upon his wife; that now and  then a few words came, as if in answers from her lips; that her  expression was sad and tender; but he saw nothing of bitterness or  pain. A deep-drawn breath was followed by one of relief, as a weight  lifted itself from his heart.<br><br>    On entering, Joe did not go immediately to the little chamber. His  heavy tread about the kitchen brought his wife somewhat hurriedly  from the room where she had been with Maggie. Joe thought it best  not to refer to the child, nor to manifest any concern in regard to  her.<br><br>    ""How soon will supper be ready?"" he asked.<br><br>    ""Right soon,"" answered Mrs. Thompson, beginning to bustle about.  There was no asperity in her voice.<br><br>    After washing from his hands and face the dust and soil of work, Joe  left the kitchen, and went to the little bedroom. A pair of large  bright eyes looked up at him from the snowy bed; looked at him  tenderly, gratefully, pleadingly. How his heart swelled in his  bosom! With what a quicker motion came the heart-beats! Joe sat  down, and now, for the first time, examining the thin frame carefully  under the lamp light, saw that it was an attractive face, and full  of a childish sweetness which suffering had not been able to  obliterate.<br><br>    ""Your name is Maggie?"" he said, as he sat down and took her soft  little hand in his.<br><br>    ""Yes, sir."" Her voice struck a chord that quivered in a low strain  of music.<br><br>    ""Have you been sick long?""<br><br>    ""Yes, sir."" What a sweet patience was in her tone!<br><br>    ""Has the doctor been to see you?""<br><br>    ""He used to come.""<br><br>    ""But not lately?""<br><br>    ""No, sir.""<br><br>    ""Have you any pain?""<br><br>    ""Sometimes, but not now.""<br><br>    ""When had you pain?""<br><br>    ""This morning my side ached, and my back hurt when you carried me.""<br><br>    ""It hurts you to be lifted or moved about?""<br><br>    ""Yes, sir.""<br><br>    ""Your side doesn't ache now?""<br><br>    ""No, sir.""<br><br>    ""Does it ache a great deal?""<br><br>    ""Yes, sir; but it hasn't ached any since I've been on this soft  bed.""<br><br>    ""The soft bed feels good.""<br><br>    ""O, yes, sir--so good!"" What a satisfaction, mingled with gratitude,  was in her voice!<br><br>    ""Supper is ready,"" said Mrs. Thompson, looking into the room a  little while afterwards.<br><br>    Joe glanced from his wife's face to that of Maggie; she understood  him, and answered,--<br><br>    ""She can wait until we are done; then I will bring her somethings to  eat."" There was an effort at indifference on the part of Mrs.  Thompson, but her husband had seen her through the window, and  understood that the coldness was assumed. Joe waited, after sitting  down to the table, for his wife to introduce the subject uppermost  in both of their thoughts; but she kept silent on that theme, for  many minutes, and he maintained a like reserve. At last she said,  abruptly,--<br><br>    ""What are you going to do with that child?""<br><br>    ""I thought you understood me that she was to go to the poorhouse,""  replied Joe, as if surprised at her question.<br><br>    Mrs. Thompson looked rather strangely at her husband for sonic  moments, and then dropped her eyes. The subject was not again  referred to during the meal. At its close, Mrs. Thompson toasted a  slice of bread, and softened, it with milk and butter; adding to  this a cup of tea, she took them into Maggie, and held the small  waiter, on which she had placed them, while the hungry child ate  with every sign of pleasure.<br><br>    ""Is it good?"" asked Mrs. Thompson, seeing with what a keen relish  the food was taken.<br><br>    The child paused with the cup in her hand, and answered with a look  of gratitude that awoke to new life old human feelings which had  been slumbering in her heart for half a score of years.<br><br>    ""We'll keep her a day or two longer; she is so weak and helpless,""  said Mrs. Joe Thompson, in answer to her husband's remark, at  breakfast-time on the next morning, that he must step down and see  the Guardians of the Poor about Maggie.<br><br>    ""She'll be so much in your way,"" said Joe.<br><br>    ""I sha'n't mind that for a day or two. Poor thing!""<br><br>    Joe did not see the Guardians of the Poor on that day, on the next,  nor on the day following. In fact, he never saw them at all on  Maggie's account, for in less than a week Mrs. Joe Thompson would as  soon leave thought of taking up her own abode in the almshouse as  sending Maggie there.<br><br>    What light and blessing did that sick and helpless child bring to  the home of Joe Thompson, the poor wheelwright! It had been dark,  and cold, and miserable there for a long time just because his wife  had nothing to love and care for out of herself, and so became sore,  irritable, ill-tempered, and self-afflicting in the desolation of  her woman's nature. Now the sweetness of that sick child, looking  ever to her in love, patience, and gratitude, was as honey to her  soul, and she carried her in her heart as well as in her arms, a  precious burden. As for Joe Thompson, there was not a man in all the  neighborhood who drank daily of a more precious wine of life than  he. An angel had come into his house, disguised as a sick, helpless,  and miserable child, and filled all its dreary chambers with the  sunshine of love.                                                         <br><br>"
20,Bartleby The Scrivner - By Herman Melville,"  <b>Bartleby, the Scrivener.  <p>  A Story of Wall-street.</b>  <br><br>  A Story of Wall-street.<br><br>  I AM a rather elderly man. The nature of my avocations for the last thirty years has brought me into more than ordinary contact with what would seem an interesting and somewhat singular set of men, of whom as yet nothing that I know of has ever been written:--I mean the law-copyists or scriveners. I have known very many of them, professionally and privately, and if I pleased, could relate divers histories, at which good-natured gentlemen might smile, and sentimental souls might weep. But I waive the biographies of all other scriveners for a few passages in the life of Bartleby, who was a scrivener the strangest I ever saw or heard of. While of other law-copyists I might write the complete life, of Bartleby nothing of that sort can be done. I believe that no materials exist for a full and satisfactory biography of this man. It is an irreparable loss to literature. Bartleby was one of those beings of whom nothing is ascertainable, except from the original sources, and in his case those are very small. What my own astonished eyes saw of Bartleby, that is all I know of him, except, indeed, one vague report which will appear in the sequel.  <br><br>  Ere introducing the scrivener, as he first appeared to me, it is fit I make some mention of myself, my employes, my business, my chambers, and general surroundings; because some such description is indispensable to an adequate understanding of the chief character about to be presented.  <br><br>  Imprimis: I am a man who, from his youth upwards, has been filled with a profound conviction that the easiest way of life is the best. Hence, though I belong to a profession proverbially energetic and nervous, even to turbulence, at times, yet nothing of that sort have I ever suffered to invade my peace. I am one of those unambitious lawyers who never addresses a jury, or in any way draws down public applause; but in the cool tranquillity of a snug retreat, do a snug business among rich men's bonds and mortgages and title-deeds. All who know me consider me an eminently safe man. The late John Jacob Astor, a personage little given to poetic enthusiasm, had no hesitation in pronouncing my first grand point to be prudence; my next, method. I do not speak it in vanity, but simply record the fact, that I was not unemployed in my profession by the late John Jacob Astor; a name which, I admit, I love to repeat, for it hath a rounded and orbicular sound to it, and rings like unto bullion. I will freely add, that I was not insensible to the late John Jacob Astor's good opinion.  <br><br>  Some time prior to the period at which this little history begins, my avocations had been largely increased. The good old office, now extinct in the State of New-York, of a Master in Chancery, had been conferred upon me. It was not a very arduous office, but very pleasantly remunerative. I seldom lose my temper; much more seldom indulge in dangerous indignation at wrongs and outrages; but I must be permitted to be rash here and declare, that I consider the sudden and violent abrogation of the office of Master of Chancery, by the new Constitution, as a ---- premature act; inasmuch as I had counted upon a life-lease of the profits, whereas I only received those of a few short years. But this is by the way.  <br><br>  My chambers were up stairs at No. -- Wall-street. At one end they looked upon the white wall of the interior of a spacious sky-light shaft, penetrating the building from top to bottom. This view might have been considered rather tame than otherwise, deficient in what landscape painters call ""life."" But if so, the view from the other end of my chambers offered, at least, a contrast, if nothing more. In that direction my windows commanded an unobstructed view of a lofty brick wall, black by age and everlasting shade; which wall required no spy-glass to bring out its lurking beauties, but for the benefit of all near-sighted spectators, was pushed up to within ten feet of my window panes. Owing to the great height of the surrounding buildings, and my chambers being on the second floor, the interval between this wall and mine not a little resembled a huge square cistern.  <br><br>  At the period just preceding the advent of Bartleby, I had two persons as copyists in my employment, and a promising lad as an office-boy. First, Turkey; second, Nippers; third, Ginger Nut. These may seem names, the like of which are not usually found in the Directory. In truth they were nicknames, mutually conferred upon each other by my three clerks, and were deemed expressive of their respective persons or characters. Turkey was a short, pursy Englishman of about my own age, that is, somewhere not far from sixty. In the morning, one might say, his face was of a fine florid hue, but after twelve o'clock, meridian--his dinner hour--it blazed like a grate full of Christmas coals; and continued blazing--but, as it were, with a gradual wane--till 6 o'clock, P. M. or thereabouts, after which I saw no more of the proprietor of the face, which gaining its meridian with the sun, seemed to set with it, to rise, culminate, and decline the following day, with the like regularity and undiminished glory. There are many singular coincidences I have known in the course of my life, not the least among which was the fact, that exactly when Turkey displayed his fullest beams from his red and radiant countenance, just then, too, at that critical moment, began the daily period when I considered his business capacities as seriously disturbed for the remainder of the twenty-four hours. Not that he was absolutely idle, or averse to business then; far from it. The difficulty was, he was apt to be altogether too energetic. There was a strange, inflamed, flurried, flighty recklessness of activity about him. He would be incautious in dipping his pen into his inkstand. All his blots upon my documents, were dropped there after twelve o'clock, meridian. Indeed, not only would he be reckless and sadly given to making blots in the afternoon, but some days he went further, and was rather noisy. At such times, too, his face flamed with augmented blazonry, as if cannel coal had been heaped on anthracite. He made an unpleasant racket with his chair; spilled his sand-box; in mending his pens, impatiently split them all to pieces, and threw them on the floor in a sudden passion; stood up and leaned over his table, boxing his papers about in a most indecorous manner, very sad to behold in an elderly man like him. Nevertheless, as he was in many ways a most valuable person to me, and all the time before twelve o'clock, meridian, was the quickest, steadiest creature too, accomplishing a great deal of work in a style not easy to be matched--for these reasons, I was willing to overlook his eccentricities, though indeed, occasionally, I remonstrated with him. I did this very gently, however, because, though the civilest, nay, the blandest and most reverential of men in the morning, yet in the afternoon he was disposed, upon provocation, to be slightly rash with his tongue, in fact, insolent. Now, valuing his morning services as I did, and resolved not to lose them; yet, at the same time made uncomfortable by his inflamed ways after twelve o'clock; and being a man of peace, unwilling by my admonitions to call forth unseemly retorts from him; I took upon me, one Saturday noon (he was always worse on Saturdays), to hint to him, very kindly, that perhaps now that he was growing old, it might be well to abridge his labors; in short, he need not come to my chambers after twelve o'clock, but, dinner over, had best go home to his lodgings and rest himself till tea-time. But no; he insisted upon his afternoon devotions. His countenance became intolerably fervid, as he oratorically assured me--gesticulating with a long ruler at the other end of the room--that if his services in the morning were useful, how indispensible, then, in the afternoon?  <br><br>  ""With submission, sir,"" said Turkey on this occasion, ""I consider myself your right-hand man. In the morning I but marshal and deploy my columns; but in the afternoon I put myself at their head, and gallantly charge the foe, thus!""--and he made a violent thrust with the ruler.  <br><br>  ""But the blots, Turkey,"" intimated I.  <br><br>  ""True,--but, with submission, sir, behold these hairs! I am getting old. Surely, sir, a blot or two of a warm afternoon is not to be severely urged against gray hairs. Old age--even if it blot the page--is honorable. With submission, sir, we both are getting old.""  <br><br>  This appeal to my fellow-feeling was hardly to be resisted. At all events, I saw that go he would not. So I made up my mind to let him stay, resolving, nevertheless, to see to it, that during the afternoon he had to do with my less important papers.  <br><br>  Nippers, the second on my list, was a whiskered, sallow, and, upon the whole, rather piratical-looking young man of about five and twenty. I always deemed him the victim of two evil powers--ambition and indigestion. The ambition was evinced by a certain impatience of the duties of a mere copyist, an unwarrantable usurpation of strictly professional affairs, such as the original drawing up of legal documents. The indigestion seemed betokened in an occasional nervous testiness and grinning irritability, causing the teeth to audibly grind together over mistakes committed in copying; unnecessary maledictions, hissed, rather than spoken, in the heat of business; and especially by a continual discontent with the height of the table where he worked. Though of a very ingenious mechanical turn, Nippers could never get this table to suit him. He put chips under it, blocks of various sorts, bits of pasteboard, and at last went so far as to attempt an exquisite adjustment by final pieces of folded blotting-paper. But no invention would answer. If, for the sake of easing his back, he brought the table lid at a sharp angle well up towards his chin, and wrote there like a man using the steep roof of a Dutch house for his desk:--then he declared that it stopped the circulation in his arms. If now he lowered the table to his waistbands, and stooped over it in writing, then there was a sore aching in his back. In short, the truth of the matter was, Nippers knew not what he wanted. Or, if he wanted any thing, it was to be rid of a scrivener's table altogether. Among the manifestations of his diseased ambition was a fondness he had for receiving visits from certain ambiguous-looking fellows in seedy coats, whom he called his clients. Indeed I was aware that not only was he, at times, considerable of a ward-politician, but he occasionally did a little business at the Justices' courts, and was not unknown on the steps of the Tombs. I have good reason to believe, however, that one individual who called upon him at my chambers, and who, with a grand air, he insisted was his client, was no other than a dun, and the alleged title-deed, a bill. But with all his failings, and the annoyances he caused me, Nippers, like his compatriot Turkey, was a very useful man to me; wrote a neat, swift hand; and, when he chose, was not deficient in a gentlemanly sort of deportment. Added to this, he always dressed in a gentlemanly sort of way; and so, incidentally, reflected credit upon my chambers. Whereas with respect to Turkey, I had much ado to keep him from being a reproach to me. His clothes were apt to look oily and smell of eating-houses. He wore his pantaloons very loose and baggy in summer. His coats were execrable; his hat not be to handled. But while the hat was a thing of indifference to me, inasmuch as his natural civility and deference, as a dependent Englishman, always led him to doff it the moment he entered the room, yet his coat was another matter. Concerning his coats, I reasoned with him; but with no effect. The truth was, I suppose, that a man with so small an income, could not afford to sport such a lustrous face and a lustrous coat at one and the same time. As Nippers once observed, Turkey's money went chiefly for red ink. One winter day I presented Turkey with a highly-respectable looking coat of my own, a padded gray coat, of a most comfortable warmth, and which buttoned straight up from the knee to the neck. I thought Turkey would appreciate the favor, and abate his rashness and obstreperousness of afternoons. But no. I verily believe that buttoning himself up in so downy and blanket-like a coat had a pernicious effect upon him; upon the same principle that too much oats are bad for horses. In fact, precisely as a rash, restive horse is said to feel his oats, so Turkey felt his coat. It made him insolent. He was a man whom prosperity harmed.  <br><br>  Though concerning the self-indulgent habits of Turkey I had my own private surmises, yet touching Nippers I was well persuaded that whatever might be his faults in other respects, he was, at least, a temperate young man. But indeed, nature herself seemed to have been his vintner, and at his birth charged him so thoroughly with an irritable, brandy-like disposition, that all subsequent potations were needless. When I consider how, amid the stillness of my chambers, Nippers would sometimes impatiently rise from his seat, and stooping over his table, spread his arms wide apart, seize the whole desk, and move it, and jerk it, with a grim, grinding motion on the floor, as if the table were a perverse voluntary agent, intent on thwarting and vexing him; I plainly perceive that for Nippers, brandy and water were altogether superfluous.  <br><br>  It was fortunate for me that, owing to its peculiar cause--indigestion--the irritability and consequent nervousness of Nippers, were mainly observable in the morning, while in the afternoon he was comparatively mild. So that Turkey's paroxysms only coming on about twelve o'clock, I never had to do with their eccentricities at one time. Their fits relieved each other like guards. When Nippers' was on, Turkey's was off; and vice versa. This was a good natural arrangement under the circumstances.  <br><br>  Ginger Nut, the third on my list, was a lad some twelve years old. His father was a carman, ambitious of seeing his son on the bench instead of a cart, before he died. So he sent him to my office as student at law, errand boy, and cleaner and sweeper, at the rate of one dollar a week. He had a little desk to himself, but he did not use it much. Upon inspection, the drawer exhibited a great array of the shells of various sorts of nuts. Indeed, to this quick-witted youth the whole noble science of the law was contained in a nut-shell. Not the least among the employments of Ginger Nut, as well as one which he discharged with the most alacrity, was his duty as cake and apple purveyor for Turkey and Nippers. Copying law papers being proverbially a dry, husky sort of business, my two scriveners were fain to moisten their mouths very often with Spitzenbergs to be had at the numerous stalls nigh the Custom House and Post Office. Also, they sent Ginger Nut very frequently for that peculiar cake--small, flat, round, and very spicy--after which he had been named by them. Of a cold morning when business was but dull, Turkey would gobble up scores of these cakes, as if they were mere wafers--indeed they sell them at the rate of six or eight for a penny--the scrape of his pen blending with the crunching of the crisp particles in his mouth. Of all the fiery afternoon blunders and flurried rashnesses of Turkey, was his once moistening a ginger-cake between his lips, and clapping it on to a mortgage for a seal. I came within an ace of dismissing him then. But he mollified me by making an oriental bow, and saying--""With submission, sir, it was generous of me to find you in stationery on my own account.""  <br><br>  Now my original business--that of a conveyancer and title hunter, and drawer-up of recondite documents of all sorts--was considerably increased by receiving the master's office. There was now great work for scriveners. Not only must I push the clerks already with me, but I must have additional help. In answer to my advertisement, a motionless young man one morning, stood upon my office threshold, the door being open, for it was summer. I can see that figure now--pallidly neat, pitiably respectable, incurably forlorn! It was Bartleby.  <br><br>  After a few words touching his qualifications, I engaged him, glad to have among my corps of copyists a man of so singularly sedate an aspect, which I thought might operate beneficially upon the flighty temper of Turkey, and the fiery one of Nippers.  <br><br>  I should have stated before that ground glass folding-doors divided my premises into two parts, one of which was occupied by my scriveners, the other by myself. According to my humor I threw open these doors, or closed them. I resolved to assign Bartleby a corner by the folding-doors, but on my side of them, so as to have this quiet man within easy call, in case any trifling thing was to be done. I placed his desk close up to a small side-window in that part of the room, a window which originally had afforded a lateral view of certain grimy back-yards and bricks, but which, owing to subsequent erections, commanded at present no view at all, though it gave some light. Within three feet of the panes was a wall, and the light came down from far above, between two lofty buildings, as from a very small opening in a dome. Still further to a satisfactory arrangement, I procured a high green folding screen, which might entirely isolate Bartleby from my sight, though not remove him from my voice. And thus, in a manner, privacy and society were conjoined.  <br><br>  At first Bartleby did an extraordinary quantity of writing. As if long famishing for something to copy, he seemed to gorge himself on my documents. There was no pause for digestion. He ran a day and night line, copying by sun-light and by candle-light. I should have been quite delighted with his application, had be been cheerfully industrious. But he wrote on silently, palely, mechanically.  <br><br>  It is, of course, an indispensable part of a scrivener's business to verify the accuracy of his copy, word by word. Where there are two or more scriveners in an office, they assist each other in this examination, one reading from the copy, the other holding the original. It is a very dull, wearisome, and lethargic affair. I can readily imagine that to some sanguine temperaments it would be altogether intolerable. For example, I cannot credit that the mettlesome poet Byron would have contentedly sat down with Bartleby to examine a law document of, say five hundred pages, closely written in a crimpy hand.  <br><br>  Now and then, in the haste of business, it had been my habit to assist in comparing some brief document myself, calling Turkey or Nippers for this purpose. One object I had in placing Bartleby so handy to me behind the screen, was to avail myself of his services on such trivial occasions. It was on the third day, I think, of his being with me, and before any necessity had arisen for having his own writing examined, that, being much hurried to complete a small affair I had in hand, I abruptly called to Bartleby. In my haste and natural expectancy of instant compliance, I sat with my head bent over the original on my desk, and my right hand sideways, and somewhat nervously extended with the copy, so that immediately upon emerging from his retreat, Bartleby might snatch it and proceed to business without the least delay.  <br><br>  In this very attitude did I sit when I called to him, rapidly stating what it was I wanted him to do--namely, to examine a small paper with me. Imagine my surprise, nay, my consternation, when without moving from his privacy, Bartleby in a singularly mild, firm voice, replied, ""I would prefer not to.""  <br><br>  I sat awhile in perfect silence, rallying my stunned faculties. Immediately it occurred to me that my ears had deceived me, or Bartleby had entirely misunderstood my meaning. I repeated my request in the clearest tone I could assume. But in quite as clear a one came the previous reply, ""I would prefer not to.""  <br><br>  ""Prefer not to,"" echoed I, rising in high excitement, and crossing the room with a stride. ""What do you mean? Are you moon-struck? I want you to help me compare this sheet here--take it,"" and I thrust it towards him.  <br><br>  ""I would prefer not to,"" said he.  <br><br>  I looked at him steadfastly. His face was leanly composed; his gray eye dimly calm. Not a wrinkle of agitation rippled him. Had there been the least uneasiness, anger, impatience or impertinence in his manner; in other words, had there been any thing ordinarily human about him, doubtless I should have violently dismissed him from the premises. But as it was, I should have as soon thought of turning my pale plaster-of-paris bust of Cicero out of doors. I stood gazing at him awhile, as he went on with his own writing, and then reseated myself at my desk. This is very strange, thought I. What had one best do? But my business hurried me. I concluded to forget the matter for the present, reserving it for my future leisure. So calling Nippers from the other room, the paper was speedily examined.  <br><br>  A few days after this, Bartleby concluded four lengthy documents, being quadruplicates of a week's testimony taken before me in my High Court of Chancery. It became necessary to examine them. It was an important suit, and great accuracy was imperative. Having all things arranged I called Turkey, Nippers and Ginger Nut from the next room, meaning to place the four copies in the hands of my four clerks, while I should read from the original. Accordingly Turkey, Nippers and Ginger Nut had taken their seats in a row, each with his document in hand, when I called to Bartleby to join this interesting group.  <br><br>  ""Bartleby! quick, I am waiting.""  <br><br>  I heard a slow scrape of his chair legs on the uncarpeted floor, and soon he appeared standing at the entrance of his hermitage.  <br><br>  ""What is wanted?"" said he mildly.  <br><br>  ""The copies, the copies,"" said I hurriedly. ""We are going to examine them. There""--and I held towards him the fourth quadruplicate.  <br><br>  ""I would prefer not to,"" he said, and gently disappeared behind the screen.  <br><br>  For a few moments I was turned into a pillar of salt, standing at the head of my seated column of clerks. Recovering myself, I advanced towards the screen, and demanded the reason for such extraordinary conduct.  <br><br>  ""Why do you refuse?""  <br><br>  ""I would prefer not to.""  <br><br>  With any other man I should have flown outright into a dreadful passion, scorned all further words, and thrust him ignominiously from my presence. But there was something about Bartleby that not only strangely disarmed me, but in a wonderful manner touched and disconcerted me. I began to reason with him.  <br><br>  ""These are your own copies we are about to examine. It is labor saving to you, because one examination will answer for your four papers. It is common usage. Every copyist is bound to help examine his copy. Is it not so? Will you not speak? Answer!""  <br><br>  ""I prefer not to,"" he replied in a flute-like tone. It seemed to me that while I had been addressing him, he carefully revolved every statement that I made; fully comprehended the meaning; could not gainsay the irresistible conclusion; but, at the same time, some paramount consideration prevailed with him to reply as he did.  <br><br>  ""You are decided, then, not to comply with my request--a request made according to common usage and common sense?""  <br><br>  He briefly gave me to understand that on that point my judgment was sound. Yes: his decision was irreversible.  <br><br>  It is not seldom the case that when a man is browbeaten in some unprecedented and violently unreasonable way, he begins to stagger in his own plainest faith. He begins, as it were, vaguely to surmise that, wonderful as it may be, all the justice and all the reason is on the other side. Accordingly, if any disinterested persons are present, he turns to them for some reinforcement for his own faltering mind.  <br><br>  ""Turkey,"" said I, ""what do you think of this? Am I not right?""  <br><br>  ""With submission, sir,"" said Turkey, with his blandest tone, ""I think that you are.""  <br><br>  ""Nippers,"" said I, ""what do you think of it?""  <br><br>  ""I think I should kick him out of the office.""  <br><br>  (The reader of nice perceptions will here perceive that, it being morning, Turkey's answer is couched in polite and tranquil terms, but Nippers replies in ill-tempered ones. Or, to repeat a previous sentence, Nippers's ugly mood was on duty, and Turkey's off.)  <br><br>  ""Ginger Nut,"" said I, willing to enlist the smallest suffrage in my behalf, ""what do you think of it?""  <br><br>  ""I think, sir, he's a little luny,"" replied Ginger Nut, with a grin.  <br><br>  ""You hear what they say,"" said I, turning towards the screen, ""come forth and do your duty.""  <br><br>  But he vouchsafed no reply. I pondered a moment in sore perplexity. But once more business hurried me. I determined again to postpone the consideration of this dilemma to my future leisure. With a little trouble we made out to examine the papers without Bartleby, though at every page or two, Turkey deferentially dropped his opinion that this proceeding was quite out of the common; while Nippers, twitching in his chair with a dyspeptic nervousness, ground out between his set teeth occasional hissing maledictions against the stubborn oaf behind the screen. And for his (Nippers's) part, this was the first and the last time he would do another man's business without pay.  <br><br>  Meanwhile Bartleby sat in his hermitage, oblivious to every thing but his own peculiar business there.  <br><br>  Some days passed, the scrivener being employed upon another lengthy work. His late remarkable conduct led me to regard his ways narrowly. I observed that he never went to dinner; indeed that he never went any where. As yet I had never of my personal knowledge known him to be outside of my office. He was a perpetual sentry in the corner. At about eleven o'clock though, in the morning, I noticed that Ginger Nut would advance toward the opening in Bartleby's screen, as if silently beckoned thither by a gesture invisible to me where I sat. The boy would then leave the office jingling a few pence, and reappear with a handful of ginger-nuts which he delivered in the hermitage, receiving two of the cakes for his trouble.  <br><br>  He lives, then, on ginger-nuts, thought I; never eats a dinner, properly speaking; he must be a vegetarian then; but no; he never eats even vegetables, he eats nothing but ginger-nuts. My mind then ran on in reveries concerning the probable effects upon the human constitution of living entirely on ginger-nuts. Ginger-nuts are so called because they contain ginger as one of their peculiar constituents, and the final flavoring one. Now what was ginger? A hot, spicy thing. Was Bartleby hot and spicy? Not at all. Ginger, then, had no effect upon Bartleby. Probably he preferred it should have none.  <br><br>  Nothing so aggravates an earnest person as a passive resistance. If the individual so resisted be of a not inhumane temper, and the resisting one perfectly harmless in his passivity; then, in the better moods of the former, he will endeavor charitably to construe to his imagination what proves impossible to be solved by his judgment. Even so, for the most part, I regarded Bartleby and his ways. Poor fellow! thought I, he means no mischief; it is plain he intends no insolence; his aspect sufficiently evinces that his eccentricities are involuntary. He is useful to me. I can get along with him. If I turn him away, the chances are he will fall in with some less indulgent employer, and then he will be rudely treated, and perhaps driven forth miserably to starve. Yes. Here I can cheaply purchase a delicious self-approval. To befriend Bartleby; to humor him in his strange wilfulness, will cost me little or nothing, while I lay up in my soul what will eventually prove a sweet morsel for my conscience. But this mood was not invariable with me. The passiveness of Bartleby sometimes irritated me. I felt strangely goaded on to encounter him in new opposition, to elicit some angry spark from him answerable to my own. But indeed I might as well have essayed to strike fire with my knuckles against a bit of Windsor soap. But one afternoon the evil impulse in me mastered me, and the following little scene ensued:  <br><br>  ""Bartleby,"" said I, ""when those papers are all copied, I will compare them with you.""  <br><br>  ""I would prefer not to.""  <br><br>  ""How? Surely you do not mean to persist in that mulish vagary?""  <br><br>  No answer.  <br><br>  I threw open the folding-doors near by, and turning upon Turkey and Nippers, exclaimed in an excited manner--  <br><br>  ""He says, a second time, he won't examine his papers. What do you think of it, Turkey?""  <br><br>  It was afternoon, be it remembered. Turkey sat glowing like a brass boiler, his bald head steaming, his hands reeling among his blotted papers.  <br><br>  ""Think of it?"" roared Turkey; ""I think I'll just step behind his screen, and black his eyes for him!""  <br><br>  So saying, Turkey rose to his feet and threw his arms into a pugilistic position. He was hurrying away to make good his promise, when I detained him, alarmed at the effect of incautiously rousing Turkey's combativeness after dinner.  <br><br>  ""Sit down, Turkey,"" said I, ""and hear what Nippers has to say. What do you think of it, Nippers? Would I not be justified in immediately dismissing Bartleby?""  <br><br>  ""Excuse me, that is for you to decide, sir. I think his conduct quite unusual, and indeed unjust, as regards Turkey and myself. But it may only be a passing whim.""  <br><br>  ""Ah,"" exclaimed I, ""you have strangely changed your mind then--you speak very gently of him now.""  <br><br>  ""All beer,"" cried Turkey; ""gentleness is effects of beer--Nippers and I dined together to-day. You see how gentle I am, sir. Shall I go and black his eyes?""  <br><br>  ""You refer to Bartleby, I suppose. No, not to-day, Turkey,"" I replied; ""pray, put up your fists.""  <br><br>  I closed the doors, and again advanced towards Bartleby. I felt additional incentives tempting me to my fate. I burned to be rebelled against again. I remembered that Bartleby never left the office.  <br><br>  ""Bartleby,"" said I, ""Ginger Nut is away; just step round to the Post Office, won't you? (it was but a three minutes walk,) and see if there is any thing for me.""  <br><br>  ""I would prefer not to.""  <br><br>  ""You will not?""  <br><br>  ""I prefer not.""  <br><br>  I staggered to my desk, and sat there in a deep study. My blind inveteracy returned. Was there any other thing in which I could procure myself to be ignominiously repulsed by this lean, penniless wight?--my hired clerk? What added thing is there, perfectly reasonable, that he will be sure to refuse to do?  <br><br>  ""Bartleby!""  <br><br>  No answer.  <br><br>  ""Bartleby,"" in a louder tone.  <br><br>  No answer.  <br><br>  ""Bartleby,"" I roared.  <br><br>  Like a very ghost, agreeably to the laws of magical invocation, at the third summons, he appeared at the entrance of his hermitage.  <br><br>  ""Go to the next room, and tell Nippers to come to me.""  <br><br>  ""I prefer not to,"" he respectfully and slowly said, and mildly disappeared.  <br><br>  ""Very good, Bartleby,"" said I, in a quiet sort of serenely severe self-possessed tone, intimating the unalterable purpose of some terrible retribution very close at hand. At the moment I half intended something of the kind. But upon the whole, as it was drawing towards my dinner-hour, I thought it best to put on my hat and walk home for the day, suffering much from perplexity and distress of mind.  <br><br>  Shall I acknowledge it? The conclusion of this whole business was, that it soon became a fixed fact of my chambers, that a pale young scrivener, by the name of Bartleby, had a desk there; that he copied for me at the usual rate of four cents a folio (one hundred words); but he was permanently exempt from examining the work done by him, that duty being transferred to Turkey and Nippers, one of compliment doubtless to their superior acuteness; moreover, said Bartleby was never on any account to be dispatched on the most trivial errand of any sort; and that even if entreated to take upon him such a matter, it was generally understood that he would prefer not to--in other words, that he would refuse point-blank.  <br><br>  As days passed on, I became considerably reconciled to Bartleby. His steadiness, his freedom from all dissipation, his incessant industry (except when he chose to throw himself into a standing revery behind his screen), his great stillness, his unalterableness of demeanor under all circumstances, made him a valuable acquisition. One prime thing was this,--he was always there;--first in the morning, continually through the day, and the last at night. I had a singular confidence in his honesty. I felt my most precious papers perfectly safe in his hands. Sometimes to be sure I could not, for the very soul of me, avoid falling into sudden spasmodic passions with him. For it was exceeding difficult to bear in mind all the time those strange peculiarities, privileges, and unheard of exemptions, forming the tacit stipulations on Bartleby's part under which he remained in my office. Now and then, in the eagerness of dispatching pressing business, I would inadvertently summon Bartleby, in a short, rapid tone, to put his finger, say, on the incipient tie of a bit of red tape with which I was about compressing some papers. Of course, from behind the screen the usual answer, ""I prefer not to,"" was sure to come; and then, how could a human creature with the common infirmities of our nature, refrain from bitterly exclaiming upon such perverseness--such unreasonableness. However, every added repulse of this sort which I received only tended to lessen the probability of my repeating the inadvertence.  <br><br>  Here it must be said, that according to the custom of most legal gentlemen occupying chambers in densely-populated law buildings, there were several keys to my door. One was kept by a woman residing in the attic, which person weekly scrubbed and daily swept and dusted my apartments. Another was kept by Turkey for convenience sake. The third I sometimes carried in my own pocket. The fourth I knew not who had.  <br><br>  Now, one Sunday morning I happened to go to Trinity Church, to hear a celebrated preacher, and finding myself rather early on the ground, I thought I would walk round to my chambers for a while. Luckily I had my key with me; but upon applying it to the lock, I found it resisted by something inserted from the inside. Quite surprised, I called out; when to my consternation a key was turned from within; and thrusting his lean visage at me, and holding the door ajar, the apparition of Bartleby appeared, in his shirt sleeves, and otherwise in a strangely tattered dishabille, saying quietly that he was sorry, but he was deeply engaged just then, and--preferred not admitting me at present. In a brief word or two, he moreover added, that perhaps I had better walk round the block two or three times, and by that time he would probably have concluded his affairs.  <br><br>  Now, the utterly unsurmised appearance of Bartleby, tenanting my law-chambers of a Sunday morning, with his cadaverously gentlemanly nonchalance, yet withal firm and self-possessed, had such a strange effect upon me, that incontinently I slunk away from my own door, and did as desired. But not without sundry twinges of impotent rebellion against the mild effrontery of this unaccountable scrivener. Indeed, it was his wonderful mildness chiefly, which not only disarmed me, but unmanned me, as it were. For I consider that one, for the time, is a sort of unmanned when he tranquilly permits his hired clerk to dictate to him, and order him away from his own premises. Furthermore, I was full of uneasiness as to what Bartleby could possibly be doing in my office in his shirt sleeves, and in an otherwise dismantled condition of a Sunday morning. Was any thing amiss going on? Nay, that was out of the question. It was not to be thought of for a moment that Bartleby was an immoral person. But what could he be doing there?--copying? Nay again, whatever might be his eccentricities, Bartleby was an eminently decorous person. He would be the last man to sit down to his desk in any state approaching to nudity. Besides, it was Sunday; and there was something about Bartleby that forbade the supposition that we would by any secular occupation violate the proprieties of the day.  <br><br>  Nevertheless, my mind was not pacified; and full of a restless curiosity, at last I returned to the door. Without hindrance I inserted my key, opened it, and entered. Bartleby was not to be seen. I looked round anxiously, peeped behind his screen; but it was very plain that he was gone. Upon more closely examining the place, I surmised that for an indefinite period Bartleby must have ate, dressed, and slept in my office, and that too without plate, mirror, or bed. The cushioned seat of a ricketty old sofa in one corner bore the faint impress of a lean, reclining form. Rolled away under his desk, I found a blanket; under the empty grate, a blacking box and brush; on a chair, a tin basin, with soap and a ragged towel; in a newspaper a few crumbs of ginger-nuts and a morsel of cheese. Yet, thought I, it is evident enough that Bartleby has been making his home here, keeping bachelor's hall all by himself. Immediately then the thought came sweeping across me, What miserable friendlessness and loneliness are here revealed! His poverty is great; but his solitude, how horrible! Think of it. Of a Sunday, Wall-street is deserted as Petra; and every night of every day it is an emptiness. This building too, which of week-days hums with industry and life, at nightfall echoes with sheer vacancy, and all through Sunday is forlorn. And here Bartleby makes his home; sole spectator of a solitude which he has seen all populous--a sort of innocent and transformed Marius brooding among the ruins of Carthage!  <br><br>  For the first time in my life a feeling of overpowering stinging melancholy seized me. Before, I had never experienced aught but a not-unpleasing sadness. The bond of a common humanity now drew me irresistibly to gloom. A fraternal melancholy! For both I and Bartleby were sons of Adam. I remembered the bright silks and sparkling faces I had seen that day, in gala trim, swan-like sailing down the Mississippi of Broadway; and I contrasted them with the pallid copyist, and thought to myself, Ah, happiness courts the light, so we deem the world is gay; but misery hides aloof, so we deem that misery there is none. These sad fancyings--chimeras, doubtless, of a sick and silly brain--led on to other and more special thoughts, concerning the eccentricities of Bartleby. Presentiments of strange discoveries hovered round me. The scrivener's pale form appeared to me laid out, among uncaring strangers, in its shivering winding sheet.  <br><br>  Suddenly I was attracted by Bartleby's closed desk, the key in open sight left in the lock.  <br><br>  I mean no mischief, seek the gratification of no heartless curiosity, thought I; besides, the desk is mine, and its contents too, so I will make bold to look within. Every thing was methodically arranged, the papers smoothly placed. The pigeon holes were deep, and removing the files of documents, I groped into their recesses. Presently I felt something there, and dragged it out. It was an old bandanna handkerchief, heavy and knotted. I opened it, and saw it was a savings' bank.  <br><br>  I now recalled all the quiet mysteries which I had noted in the man. I remembered that he never spoke but to answer; that though at intervals he had considerable time to himself, yet I had never seen him reading--no, not even a newspaper; that for long periods he would stand looking out, at his pale window behind the screen, upon the dead brick wall; I was quite sure he never visited any refectory or eating house; while his pale face clearly indicated that he never drank beer like Turkey, or tea and coffee even, like other men; that he never went any where in particular that I could learn; never went out for a walk, unless indeed that was the case at present; that he had declined telling who he was, or whence he came, or whether he had any relatives in the world; that though so thin and pale, he never complained of ill health. And more than all, I remembered a certain unconscious air of pallid--how shall I call it?--of pallid haughtiness, say, or rather an austere reserve about him, which had positively awed me into my tame compliance with his eccentricities, when I had feared to ask him to do the slightest incidental thing for me, even though I might know, from his long-continued motionlessness, that behind his screen he must be standing in one of those dead-wall reveries of his.  <br><br>  Revolving all these things, and coupling them with the recently discovered fact that he made my office his constant abiding place and home, and not forgetful of his morbid moodiness; revolving all these things, a prudential feeling began to steal over me. My first emotions had been those of pure melancholy and sincerest pity; but just in proportion as the forlornness of Bartleby grew and grew to my imagination, did that same melancholy merge into fear, that pity into repulsion. So true it is, and so terrible too, that up to a certain point the thought or sight of misery enlists our best affections; but, in certain special cases, beyond that point it does not. They err who would assert that invariably this is owing to the inherent selfishness of the human heart. It rather proceeds from a certain hopelessness of remedying excessive and organic ill. To a sensitive being, pity is not seldom pain. And when at last it is perceived that such pity cannot lead to effectual succor, common sense bids the soul be rid of it. What I saw that morning persuaded me that the scrivener was the victim of innate and incurable disorder. I might give alms to his body; but his body did not pain him; it was his soul that suffered, and his soul I could not reach.  <br><br>  I did not accomplish the purpose of going to Trinity Church that morning. Somehow, the things I had seen disqualified me for the time from church-going. I walked homeward, thinking what I would do with Bartleby. Finally, I resolved upon this;--I would put certain calm questions to him the next morning, touching his history, etc., and if he declined to answer then openly and reservedly (and I supposed he would prefer not), then to give him a twenty dollar bill over and above whatever I might owe him, and tell him his services were no longer required; but that if in any other way I could assist him, I would be happy to do so, especially if he desired to return to his native place, wherever that might be, I would willingly help to defray the expenses. Moreover, if, after reaching home, he found himself at any time in want of aid, a letter from him would be sure of a reply.  <br><br>  The next morning came.  <br><br>  ""Bartleby,"" said I, gently calling to him behind his screen.  <br><br>  No reply.  <br><br>  ""Bartleby,"" said I, in a still gentler tone, ""come here; I am not going to ask you to do any thing you would prefer not to do--I simply wish to speak to you.""  <br><br>  Upon this he noiselessly slid into view.  <br><br>  ""Will you tell me, Bartleby, where you were born?""  <br><br>  ""I would prefer not to.""  <br><br>  ""Will you tell me any thing about yourself?""  <br><br>  ""I would prefer not to.""  <br><br>  ""But what reasonable objection can you have to speak to me? I feel friendly towards you.""  <br><br>  He did not look at me while I spoke, but kept his glance fixed upon my bust of Cicero, which as I then sat, was directly behind me, some six inches above my head.  <br><br>  ""What is your answer, Bartleby?"" said I, after waiting a considerable time for a reply, during which his countenance remained immovable, only there was the faintest conceivable tremor of the white attenuated mouth.  <br><br>  ""At present I prefer to give no answer,"" he said, and retired into his hermitage.  <br><br>  It was rather weak in me I confess, but his manner on this occasion nettled me. Not only did there seem to lurk in it a certain disdain, but his perverseness seemed ungrateful, considering the undeniable good usage and indulgence he had received from me.  <br><br>  Again I sat ruminating what I should do. Mortified as I was at his behavior, and resolved as I had been to dismiss him when I entered my office, nevertheless I strangely felt something superstitious knocking at my heart, and forbidding me to carry out my purpose, and denouncing me for a villain if I dared to breathe one bitter word against this forlornest of mankind. At last, familiarly drawing my chair behind his screen, I sat down and said: ""Bartleby, never mind then about revealing your history; but let me entreat you, as a friend, to comply as far as may be with the usages of this office. Say now you will help to examine papers to-morrow or next day: in short, say now that in a day or two you will begin to be a little reasonable:--say so, Bartleby.""  <br><br>  ""At present I would prefer not to be a little reasonable,"" was his mildly cadaverous reply.  <br><br>  Just then the folding-doors opened, and Nippers approached. He seemed suffering from an unusually bad night's rest, induced by severer indigestion than common. He overheard those final words of Bartleby.  <br><br>  ""Prefer not, eh?"" gritted Nippers--""I'd prefer him, if I were you, sir,"" addressing me--""I'd prefer him; I'd give him preferences, the stubborn mule! What is it, sir, pray, that he prefers not to do now?""  <br><br>  Bartleby moved not a limb.  <br><br>  ""Mr. Nippers,"" said I, ""I'd prefer that you would withdraw for the present.""  <br><br>  Somehow, of late I had got into the way of involuntarily using this word ""prefer"" upon all sorts of not exactly suitable occasions. And I trembled to think that my contact with the scrivener had already and seriously affected me in a mental way. And what further and deeper aberration might it not yet produce? This apprehension had not been without efficacy in determining me to summary means.  <br><br>  As Nippers, looking very sour and sulky, was departing, Turkey blandly and deferentially approached.  <br><br>  ""With submission, sir,"" said he, ""yesterday I was thinking about Bartleby here, and I think that if he would but prefer to take a quart of good ale every day, it would do much towards mending him, and enabling him to assist in examining his papers.""  <br><br>  ""So you have got the word too,"" said I, slightly excited.  <br><br>  ""With submission, what word, sir,"" asked Turkey, respectfully crowding himself into the contracted space behind the screen, and by so doing, making me jostle the scrivener. ""What word, sir?""  <br><br>  ""I would prefer to be left alone here,"" said Bartleby, as if offended at being mobbed in his privacy.  <br><br>  ""That's the word, Turkey,"" said I--""that's it.""  <br><br>  ""Oh, prefer? oh yes--queer word. I never use it myself. But, sir, as I was saying, if he would but prefer--""  <br><br>  ""Turkey,"" interrupted I, ""you will please withdraw.""  <br><br>  ""Oh, certainly, sir, if you prefer that I should.""  <br><br>  As he opened the folding-door to retire, Nippers at his desk caught a glimpse of me, and asked whether I would prefer to have a certain paper copied on blue paper or white. He did not in the least roguishly accent the word prefer. It was plain that it involuntarily rolled from his tongue. I thought to myself, surely I must get rid of a demented man, who already has in some degree turned the tongues, if not the heads of myself and clerks. But I thought it prudent not to break the dismission at once.  <br><br>  The next day I noticed that Bartleby did nothing but stand at his window in his dead-wall revery. Upon asking him why he did not write, he said that he had decided upon doing no more writing.  <br><br>  ""Why, how now? what next?"" exclaimed I, ""do no more writing?""  <br><br>  ""No more.""  <br><br>  ""And what is the reason?""  <br><br>  ""Do you not see the reason for yourself,"" he indifferently replied.  <br><br>  I looked steadfastly at him, and perceived that his eyes looked dull and glazed. Instantly it occurred to me, that his unexampled diligence in copying by his dim window for the first few weeks of his stay with me might have temporarily impaired his vision.  <br><br>  I was touched. I said something in condolence with him. I hinted that of course he did wisely in abstaining from writing for a while; and urged him to embrace that opportunity of taking wholesome exercise in the open air. This, however, he did not do. A few days after this, my other clerks being absent, and being in a great hurry to dispatch certain letters by the mail, I thought that, having nothing else earthly to do, Bartleby would surely be less inflexible than usual, and carry these letters to the post-office. But he blankly declined. So, much to my inconvenience, I went myself.  <br><br>  Still added days went by. Whether Bartleby's eyes improved or not, I could not say. To all appearance, I thought they did. But when I asked him if they did, he vouchsafed no answer. At all events, he would do no copying. At last, in reply to my urgings, he informed me that he had permanently given up copying.  <br><br>  ""What!"" exclaimed I; ""suppose your eyes should get entirely well--better than ever before--would you not copy then?""  <br><br>  ""I have given up copying,"" he answered, and slid aside.  <br><br>  He remained as ever, a fixture in my chamber. Nay--if that were possible--he became still more of a fixture than before. What was to be done? He would do nothing in the office: why should he stay there? In plain fact, he had now become a millstone to me, not only useless as a necklace, but afflictive to bear. Yet I was sorry for him. I speak less than truth when I say that, on his own account, he occasioned me uneasiness. If he would but have named a single relative or friend, I would instantly have written, and urged their taking the poor fellow away to some convenient retreat. But he seemed alone, absolutely alone in the universe. A bit of wreck in the mid Atlantic. At length, necessities connected with my business tyrannized over all other considerations. Decently as I could, I told Bartleby that in six days' time he must unconditionally leave the office. I warned him to take measures, in the interval, for procuring some other abode. I offered to assist him in this endeavor, if he himself would but take the first step towards a removal. ""And when you finally quit me, Bartleby,"" added I, ""I shall see that you go not away entirely unprovided. Six days from this hour, remember.""  <br><br>  At the expiration of that period, I peeped behind the screen, and lo! Bartleby was there.  <br><br>  I buttoned up my coat, balanced myself; advanced slowly towards him, touched his shoulder, and said, ""The time has come; you must quit this place; I am sorry for you; here is money; but you must go.""  <br><br>  ""I would prefer not,"" he replied, with his back still towards me.  <br><br>  ""You must.""  <br><br>  He remained silent.  <br><br>  Now I had an unbounded confidence in this man's common honesty. He had frequently restored to me sixpences and shillings carelessly dropped upon the floor, for I am apt to be very reckless in such shirt-button affairs. The proceeding then which followed will not be deemed extraordinary.  <br><br>  ""Bartleby,"" said I, ""I owe you twelve dollars on account; here are thirty-two; the odd twenty are yours.--Will you take it?"" and I handed the bills towards him.  <br><br>  But he made no motion.  <br><br>  ""I will leave them here then,"" putting them under a weight on the table. Then taking my hat and cane and going to the door I tranquilly turned and added--""After you have removed your things from these offices, Bartleby, you will of course lock the door--since every one is now gone for the day but you--and if you please, slip your key underneath the mat, so that I may have it in the morning. I shall not see you again; so good-bye to you. If hereafter in your new place of abode I can be of any service to you, do not fail to advise me by letter. Good-bye, Bartleby, and fare you well.""  <br><br>  But he answered not a word; like the last column of some ruined temple, he remained standing mute and solitary in the middle of the otherwise deserted room.  <br><br>  As I walked home in a pensive mood, my vanity got the better of my pity. I could not but highly plume myself on my masterly management in getting rid of Bartleby. Masterly I call it, and such it must appear to any dispassionate thinker. The beauty of my procedure seemed to consist in its perfect quietness. There was no vulgar bullying, no bravado of any sort, no choleric hectoring, and striding to and fro across the apartment, jerking out vehement commands for Bartleby to bundle himself off with his beggarly traps. Nothing of the kind. Without loudly bidding Bartleby depart--as an inferior genius might have done--I assumed the ground that depart he must; and upon the assumption built all I had to say. The more I thought over my procedure, the more I was charmed with it. Nevertheless, next morning, upon awakening, I had my doubts,--I had somehow slept off the fumes of vanity. One of the coolest and wisest hours a man has, is just after he awakes in the morning. My procedure seemed as sagacious as ever,--but only in theory. How it would prove in practice--there was the rub. It was truly a beautiful thought to have assumed Bartleby's departure; but, after all, that assumption was simply my own, and none of Bartleby's. The great point was, not whether I had assumed that he would quit me, but whether he would prefer so to do. He was more a man of preferences than assumptions.  <br><br>  After breakfast, I walked down town, arguing the probabilities pro and con. One moment I thought it would prove a miserable failure, and Bartleby would be found all alive at my office as usual; the next moment it seemed certain that I should see his chair empty. And so I kept veering about. At the corner of Broadway and Canal-street, I saw quite an excited group of people standing in earnest conversation.  <br><br>  ""I'll take odds he doesn't,"" said a voice as I passed.  <br><br>  ""Doesn't go?--done!"" said I, ""put up your money.""  <br><br>  I was instinctively putting my hand in my pocket to produce my own, when I remembered that this was an election day. The words I had overheard bore no reference to Bartleby, but to the success or non-success of some candidate for the mayoralty. In my intent frame of mind, I had, as it were, imagined that all Broadway shared in my excitement, and were debating the same question with me. I passed on, very thankful that the uproar of the street screened my momentary absent-mindedness.  <br><br>  As I had intended, I was earlier than usual at my office door. I stood listening for a moment. All was still. He must be gone. I tried the knob. The door was locked. Yes, my procedure had worked to a charm; he indeed must be vanished. Yet a certain melancholy mixed with this: I was almost sorry for my brilliant success. I was fumbling under the door mat for the key, which Bartleby was to have left there for me, when accidentally my knee knocked against a panel, producing a summoning sound, and in response a voice came to me from within--""Not yet; I am occupied.""  <br><br>  It was Bartleby.  <br><br>  I was thunderstruck. For an instant I stood like the man who, pipe in mouth, was killed one cloudless afternoon long ago in Virginia, by summer lightning; at his own warm open window he was killed, and remained leaning out there upon the dreamy afternoon, till some one touched him, when he fell.  <br><br>  ""Not gone!"" I murmured at last. But again obeying that wondrous ascendancy which the inscrutable scrivener had over me, and from which ascendency, for all my chafing, I could not completely escape, I slowly went down stairs and out into the street, and while walking round the block, considered what I should next do in this unheard-of perplexity. Turn the man out by an actual thrusting I could not; to drive him away by calling him hard names would not do; calling in the police was an unpleasant idea; and yet, permit him to enjoy his cadaverous triumph over me,--this too I could not think of. What was to be done? or, if nothing could be done, was there any thing further that I could assume in the matter? Yes, as before I had prospectively assumed that Bartleby would depart, so now I might retrospectively assume that departed he was. In the legitimate carrying out of this assumption, I might enter my office in a great hurry, and pretending not to see Bartleby at all, walk straight against him as if he were air. Such a proceeding would in a singular degree have the appearance of a home-thrust. It was hardly possible that Bartleby could withstand such an application of the doctrine of assumptions. But upon second thoughts the success of the plan seemed rather dubious. I resolved to argue the matter over with him again.  <br><br>  ""Bartleby,"" said I, entering the office, with a quietly severe expression, ""I am seriously displeased. I am pained, Bartleby. I had thought better of you. I had imagined you of such a gentlemanly organization, that in any delicate dilemma a slight hint would suffice--in short, an assumption. But it appears I am deceived. Why,"" I added, unaffectedly starting, ""you have not even touched the money yet,"" pointing to it, just where I had left it the evening previous.  <br><br>  He answered nothing.  <br><br>  ""Will you, or will you not, quit me?"" I now demanded in a sudden passion, advancing close to him.  <br><br>  ""I would prefer not to quit you,"" he replied, gently emphasizing the not.  <br><br>  ""What earthly right have you to stay here? Do you pay any rent? Do you pay my taxes? Or is this property yours?""  <br><br>  He answered nothing.  <br><br>  ""Are you ready to go on and write now? Are your eyes recovered? Could you copy a small paper for me this morning? or help examine a few lines? or step round to the post-office? In a word, will you do any thing at all, to give a coloring to your refusal to depart the premises?""  <br><br>  He silently retired into his hermitage.  <br><br>  I was now in such a state of nervous resentment that I thought it but prudent to check myself at present from further demonstrations. Bartleby and I were alone. I remembered the tragedy of the unfortunate Adams and the still more unfortunate Colt in the solitary office of the latter; and how poor Colt, being dreadfully incensed by Adams, and imprudently permitting himself to get wildly excited, was at unawares hurried into his fatal act--an act which certainly no man could possibly deplore more than the actor himself. Often it had occurred to me in my ponderings upon the subject, that had that altercation taken place in the public street, or at a private residence, it would not have terminated as it did. It was the circumstance of being alone in a solitary office, up stairs, of a building entirely unhallowed by humanizing domestic associations--an uncarpeted office, doubtless, of a dusty, haggard sort of appearance;--this it must have been, which greatly helped to enhance the irritable desperation of the hapless Colt.  <br><br>  But when this old Adam of resentment rose in me and tempted me concerning Bartleby, I grappled him and threw him. How? Why, simply by recalling the divine injunction: ""A new commandment give I unto you, that ye love one another."" Yes, this it was that saved me. Aside from higher considerations, charity often operates as a vastly wise and prudent principle--a great safeguard to its possessor. Men have committed murder for jealousy's sake, and anger's sake, and hatred's sake, and selfishness' sake, and spiritual pride's sake; but no man that ever I heard of, ever committed a diabolical murder for sweet charity's sake. Mere self-interest, then, if no better motive can be enlisted, should, especially with high-tempered men, prompt all beings to charity and philanthropy. At any rate, upon the occasion in question, I strove to drown my exasperated feelings towards the scrivener by benevolently construing his conduct. Poor fellow, poor fellow! thought I, he don't mean any thing; and besides, he has seen hard times, and ought to be indulged.  <br><br>  I endeavored also immediately to occupy myself, and at the same time to comfort my despondency. I tried to fancy that in the course of the morning, at such time as might prove agreeable to him, Bartleby, of his own free accord, would emerge from his hermitage, and take up some decided line of march in the direction of the door. But no. Half-past twelve o'clock came; Turkey began to glow in the face, overturn his inkstand, and become generally obstreperous; Nippers abated down into quietude and courtesy; Ginger Nut munched his noon apple; and Bartleby remained standing at his window in one of his profoundest dead-wall reveries. Will it be credited? Ought I to acknowledge it? That afternoon I left the office without saying one further word to him.  <br><br>  Some days now passed, during which, at leisure intervals I looked a little into ""Edwards on the Will,"" and ""Priestley on Necessity."" Under the circumstances, those books induced a salutary feeling. Gradually I slid into the persuasion that these troubles of mine touching the scrivener, had been all predestinated from eternity, and Bartleby was billeted upon me for some mysterious purpose of an all-wise Providence, which it was not for a mere mortal like me to fathom. Yes, Bartleby, stay there behind your screen, thought I; I shall persecute you no more; you are harmless and noiseless as any of these old chairs; in short, I never feel so private as when I know you are here. At least I see it, I feel it; I penetrate to the predestinated purpose of my life. I am content. Others may have loftier parts to enact; but my mission in this world, Bartleby, is to furnish you with office-room for such period as you may see fit to remain.  <br><br>  I believe that this wise and blessed frame of mind would have continued with me, had it not been for the unsolicited and uncharitable remarks obtruded upon me by my professional friends who visited the rooms. But thus it often is, that the constant friction of illiberal minds wears out at last the best resolves of the more generous. Though to be sure, when I reflected upon it, it was not strange that people entering my office should be struck by the peculiar aspect of the unaccountable Bartleby, and so be tempted to throw out some sinister observations concerning him. Sometimes an attorney having business with me, and calling at my office, and finding no one but the scrivener there, would undertake to obtain some sort of precise information from him touching my whereabouts; but without heeding his idle talk, Bartleby would remain standing immovable in the middle of the room. So after contemplating him in that position for a time, the attorney would depart, no wiser than he came.  <br><br>  Also, when a Reference was going on, and the room full of lawyers and witnesses and business was driving fast; some deeply occupied legal gentleman present, seeing Bartleby wholly unemployed, would request him to run round to his (the legal gentleman's) office and fetch some papers for him. Thereupon, Bartleby would tranquilly decline, and yet remain idle as before. Then the lawyer would give a great stare, and turn to me. And what could I say? At last I was made aware that all through the circle of my professional acquaintance, a whisper of wonder was running round, having reference to the strange creature I kept at my office. This worried me very much. And as the idea came upon me of his possibly turning out a long-lived man, and keep occupying my chambers, and denying my authority; and perplexing my visitors; and scandalizing my professional reputation; and casting a general gloom over the premises; keeping soul and body together to the last upon his savings (for doubtless he spent but half a dime a day), and in the end perhaps outlive me, and claim possession of my office by right of his perpetual occupancy: as all these dark anticipations crowded upon me more and more, and my friends continually intruded their relentless remarks upon the apparition in my room; a great change was wrought in me. I resolved to gather all my faculties together, and for ever rid me of this intolerable incubus.  <br><br>  Ere revolving any complicated project, however, adapted to this end, I first simply suggested to Bartleby the propriety of his permanent departure. In a calm and serious tone, I commended the idea to his carefu"
21,The Purloined Letter - By Edgard Allen Poe,"At Paris, just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of 18 -- , I was enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation and a meerschaum, in company with my friend, C. Auguste Dupin, in his little back library, or book-closet, au troisime, No. 33 Rue Dunt, Faubourg St. Germain. For one hour at least we had maintained a profound silence; while each, to any casual observer, might have seemed intently and exclusively occupied with the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the chamber. For myself, however, I was mentally discussing certain topics which had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier period of the evening; I mean the affair of the Rue Morgue, and the mystery attending the murder of Marie Rogt. I looked upon it, therefore, as something of a coincidence, when the door of our apartment was thrown open and admitted our old acquaintance, Monsieur G -- -- , the Prefect of the Parisian police.  <br><br>  We gave him a hearty welcome; for there was nearly half as much of the entertaining as of the contemptible about the man, and we had not seen him for several years. We had been sitting in the dark, and Dupin now arose for the purpose of lighting a lamp, but sat down again, without doing so, upon G.'s saying that he had called to consult us, or rather to ask the opinion of my friend, about some official business which had occasioned a great deal of trouble.  <br><br>  ""If it is any point requiring reflection,"" observed Dupin, as he forbore to enkindle the wick, ""we shall examine it to better purpose in the dark.""  <br><br>  ""That is another one of your odd notions,"" said the Prefect, who had the fashion of calling everything ""odd"" that was beyond his comprehension, and thus lived amid an absolute legion of ""oddities.""  <br><br>  ""Very true,"" said Dupin, as he supplied his visitor with a pipe, and rolled toward him a comfortable chair.  <br><br>  ""And what is the difficulty now?"" I asked. ""Nothing more in the assassination way I hope?""  <br><br>  ""Oh, no; nothing of that nature. The fact is, the business is very simple indeed, and I make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently well ourselves; but then I thought Dupin would like to hear the details of it because it is so excessively odd.""  <br><br>  ""Simple and odd,"" said Dupin.  <br><br>  ""Why, yes; and not exactly that either. The fact is, we have all been a good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple, and yet baffles us altogether.""  <br><br>  ""Perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at fault,"" said my friend.  <br><br>  ""What nonsense you do talk!"" replied the Prefect, laughing heartily.  <br><br>  ""Perhaps the mystery is a little too plain,"" said Dupin.  <br><br>  ""Oh, good heavens! who ever heard of such an idea?""  <br><br>  ""A little too self-evident.""  <br><br>  ""Ha! ha! ha! -- ha! ha! ha! -- ho! ho! ho!"" roared our visitor, profoundly amused, ""oh, Dupin, you will be the death of me yet!""  <br><br>  ""And what, after all, is the matter on hand?"" I asked.  <br><br>  ""Why, I will tell you,"" replied the Prefect, as he gave a long, steady, and contemplative puff, and settled himself in his chair. ""I will tell you in a few words; but, before I begin, let me caution you that this is an affair demanding the greatest secrecy, and that I should most probably lose the position I now hold, were it known that I confided it to any one.""  <br><br>  ""Proceed,"" said I.  <br><br>  ""Or not,"" said Dupin.  <br><br>  ""Well, then; I have received personal information, from a very high quarter, that a certain document of the last importance has been purloined from the royal apartments. The individual who purloined it is known; that beyond a doubt; he was seen to take it. It is known, also, that it still remains in his possession.""  <br><br>  ""How is this known?"" asked Dupin.  <br><br>  ""It is clearly inferred,"" replied the Prefect, ""from the nature of the document, and from the non-appearance of certain results which would at once arise from its passing out of the robber's possession -- that is to say, from his employing it as he must design in the end to employ it.""  <br><br>  ""Be a little more explicit,"" I said.  <br><br>  ""Well, I may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holder a certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immensely valuable."" The Prefect was fond of the cant of diplomacy.  <br><br>  ""Still I do not quite understand,"" said Dupin.  <br><br>  ""No? Well; the disclosure of the document to a third person, who shall be nameless, would bring in question the honor of a personage of most exalted station; and this fact gives the holder of the document an ascendancy over the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are so jeopardized.""  <br><br>  ""But this ascendancy,"" I interposed, ""would depend upon the robber's knowledge of the loser's knowledge of the robber. Who would dare -- ""  <br><br>  ""The thief,"" said G., ""is the Minister D -- -- , who dares all things, those unbecoming as well as those becoming a man. The method of the theft was not less ingenious than bold. The document in question -- a letter, to be frank -- had been received by the personage robbed while alone in the royal boudoir. During its perusal she was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of the other exalted personage from whom especially it was her wish to conceal it. After a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in a drawer, she was forced to place it, open it was, upon a table. The address, however, was uppermost, and, the contents thus unexposed, the letter escaped notice. At this juncture enters the Minister D -- -- . His lynx eye immediately perceives the paper, recognizes the handwriting of the address, observes the confusion of the personage addressed, and fathoms her secret. After some business transactions, hurried through in his ordinary manner, he produces a letter somewhat similar to the one in question, opens it, pretends to read it, and then places it in close juxtaposition to the other. Again he converses, for some fifteen minutes, upon the public affairs. At length, in taking leave, he takes also from the table the letter to which he has no claim. Its rightful owner saw, but, of course, dared not call attention to the act, in the presence of the third person who stood at her elbow. The minister decamped; leaving his own letter -- of no importance -- upon the table.""  <br><br>  ""Here, then,"" said Dupin to me, ""you have precisely what you demand to make the ascendancy complete -- the robber's knowledge of the loser's knowledge of the robber.""  <br><br>  ""Yes,"" replied the Prefect; ""and the power thus attained has, for some months past, been wielded, for political purposes, to a very dangerous extent. The personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced, every day, of the necessity of reclaiming her letter. But this, of course, cannot be done openly. In fine, driven to despair, she has committed the matter to me.""  <br><br>  ""Than whom,"" said Dupin, amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke, ""no more sagacious agent could, I suppose, be desired, or even imagined.""  <br><br>  ""You flatter me,"" replied the Prefect; ""but it is possible that some such opinion may have been entertained.""  <br><br>  ""It is clear,"" said I, ""as you observe, that the letter is still in the possession of the minister; since it is this possession, and not any employment of the letter, which bestows the power. With the employment the power departs.""  <br><br>  ""True,"" said G.; ""and upon this conviction I proceeded. My first care was to make a thorough search of the minister's hotel; and here my chief embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his knowledge. Beyond all things, I have been warned of the danger which would result from giving him reason to suspect our design.""  <br><br>  ""But,"" said I, ""you are quite au fait in these investigations. The parisian police have done this thing often before.""  <br><br>  ""Oh, yes; and for this reason I did not despair. The habits of the minister gave me, too, a great advantage. He is frequently absent from home all night. His servants are no means numerous. They sleep at a distance from their master's apartment, and, being chiefly Neapolitans, are readily made drunk. I have keys, as you know, with which I can open any chamber or cabinet in Paris. For three months a night has not passed, during the greater part of which I have not been engaged, personally, in ransacking the D -- -- Hotel. My honor is interested, and, to mention a great secret, the reward is enormous. So I did not abandon the search until I had become fully satisfied that the thief is a more astute man than myself. I fancy that I have investigated every nook and corner of the premises in which it is possible that the paper can be concealed.""  <br><br>  ""But is it not possible,"" I suggested, ""that although the letter may be in possession of the minister, as it unquestionably is, he may have concealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises?""  <br><br>  ""This is barely possible,"" said Dupin. ""The present peculiar condition of affairs at court, and especially of those intrigues in which D -- -- is known to be involved, would render the instant availability of the document -- its susceptibility of being produced at a moments notice -- a point of nearly equal importance with its possession.""  <br><br>  ""Its susceptibility of being produced?"" said I.  <br><br>  ""That is to say, of being destroyed,"" said Dupin.  <br><br>  ""True,"" I observed; ""the paper is clearly then upon the premises. As for its being upon the person of the minister, we may consider that as out of the question.""  <br><br>  ""Entirely,"" said the Prefect. ""He has been twice waylaid, as if by footpads, and his person rigidly searched for my own inspection.""  <br><br>  ""You might have spared yourself this trouble,"" said Dupin. ""D -- -- , I presume, is not altogether a fool, and, if not, must have anticipated these waylayings, as a matter of course.""  <br><br>  ""Not altogether a fool,"" said G., ""but then he is a poet, which I take to be only one removed from a fool.""  <br><br>  ""True,"" said Dupin, after a long and thoughtful whiff from his meerschaum, ""although I have been guilty of certain doggerel myself.""  <br><br>  ""Suppose you detail,"" said I, ""the particulars of your search.""  <br><br>  ""Why, the fact is, we took our time, and we searched everywhere. I have had long experience in these affairs. I took the entire building, room by room; devoting the nights of a whole week to each. We examined, first the furniture of each apartment. We opened every possible drawer; and I presume you know that, to a properly trained police-agent, such a thing as a 'secret' drawer is impossible. Any man is a dolt who permits a 'secret' drawer to escape him in a search of this kind. The thing is so plain. There is a certain amount of bulk -- of space -- to be accounted for in every cabinet. Then we have accurate rules. The fiftieth part of a line could not escape us. After the cabinets we took the chairs. The cushions we probed with the fine ling needles you have seen me employ. From the tables we removed the tops.""  <br><br>  ""Why so?""  <br><br>  ""Sometimes the top of a table, or other similarly arranged piece of furniture, is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article; then the leg is excavated, the article deposited within the cavity, and the top replaced. The bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed in the same way.""  <br><br>  ""But could not the cavity be detected by sounding?"" I asked.  <br><br>  ""By no means, if, when the article is deposited, a sufficient wadding of cotton be placed around it. Besides, in our case, we were obliged to proceed without noise.""  <br><br>  ""But you could not have removed -- you could not have taken to pieces all articles of furniture in which it would have been possible to make a deposit in the manner you mention. A letter may be compressed into a thin spiral roll, not differing much in shape or bulk from a large knitting-needle, and in this form it might be inserted into the rung of a chair, for example. You did not take to pieces all the chairs?""  <br><br>  ""Certainly not; but we did better -- we examined the rungs of every chair in the hotel, and, indeed, the jointings of every description of furniture, by the aid of a most powerful microscope. Had there been any traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect it instantly. A single grain of gimlet-dust, for example, would have been as obvious as an apple. Any disorder in the gluing -- any unusual gap in the joints -- would have sufficed to insure detection.""  <br><br>  ""I presume you looked to the mirrors, between the boards and the plates, and you probed the beds and the bedclothes, as well as the curtains and carpets.""  <br><br>  ""That of course; and when we had absolutely completed every particle of the furniture in this way, then we examined the house itself. We divided its entire surface into compartments, which we numbered, so that none might be missed; then we scrutinized each individual square inch throughout the premises, including the two houses immediately adjoining, with the microscope, as before.""  <br><br>  ""The two houses adjoining!"" I exclaimed; ""you must have had a great deal of trouble.""  <br><br>  ""We had; but the reward offered is prodigious.""  <br><br>  ""You included the grounds about the houses?""  <br><br>  ""All the grounds are paved with brick. They give us comparatively little trouble. We examined the moss between the bricks, and found it undisturbed.""  <br><br>  ""You looked among D -- -- 's papers, of course, and into the books of the library?""  <br><br>  ""Certainly; we opened every package and parcel; we not only opened every book, but we turned over every leaf in each volume, not contenting ourselves with a mere shake, according to the fashion of some of our police officers. We also measured the thickness of every book-cover, with the most accurate admeasurement, and applied to each the most jealous scrutiny of the microscope. Had any of the bindings been recently meddled with, it would have been utterly impossible that the fact should have escaped observation. Some five or six volumes, just from the hands of the binder, we carefully probed, longitudinally, with the needles.""  <br><br>  ""You explored the floors beneath the carpets?""  <br><br>  ""Beyond doubt. We removed every carpet, and examined the boards with the microscope.""  <br><br>  ""And the paper on the walls?""  <br><br>  ""Yes.""  <br><br>  ""You looked into the cellars?""  <br><br>  ""We did.""  <br><br>  ""Then,"" I said, ""you have been making a miscalculation, and the letter is not upon the premises, as you suppose.""  <br><br>  ""I fear you are right there,"" said the Prefect. ""And now, Dupin, what would you advise me to do?""  <br><br>  ""To make a thorough research of the premises.""  <br><br>  ""That is absolutely needless,"" replied G -- -- . ""I am not more sure that I breathe than I am that the letter is not at the hotel.""  <br><br>  ""I have no better advice to give you,"" said Dupin. ""You have, of course, an accurate description of the letter?""  <br><br>  ""Oh, yes!"" -- And here the Prefect, producing a memorandum-book, proceeded to read aloud a minute account of the internal, and especially of the external, appearance of the missing document. Soon after finishing the perusal of this description, he took his departure, more entirely depressed in spirits than I have ever known the good gentleman before.  <br><br>  In about a month afterward he paid another visit, and found us occupied very nearly as before. He took a pipe and a chair and entered into some ordinary conversation. At length I said:  <br><br>  ""Well, but G., what of the purloined letter? I presume you have at last made up your mind that there is no such thing as overreaching the Minister?""  <br><br>  ""Confound him, say I -- yes; I made the re-examination, however, as Dupin suggested -- but it was all labor lost, as I knew it would be.""  <br><br>  ""How much was the reward offered, did you say?"" asked Dupin.  <br><br>  ""Why, a very great deal -- a very liberal reward -- I don't like to say how much precisely; but one thing I will say, that I wouldn't mind giving my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any one who could obtain me that letter. The fact is, it is becoming of more and more importance every day; and the reward has been lately doubled. If it were trebled, however, I could do no more than I have done.""  <br><br>  ""Why, yes,"" said Dupin, drawlingly, between the whiffs of his meerschaum, ""I really -- think, G., you have not exerted yourself -- to the utmost in the matter. You might -- do a little more, I think, eh?""  <br><br>  ""How? -- in what way?""  <br><br>  ""Why -- puff, puff -- you might -- puff, puff -- employ counsel in the matter, eh? -- puff, puff, puff. Do you remember the story they tell of Abernethy?""  <br><br>  ""No; hang Abernethy!""  <br><br>  ""To be sure! hang him and welcome. But, once upon a time, a certain rich miser conceived the design of spunging upon this Abernethy for a medical opinion. Getting up, for this purpose, an ordinary conversation in a private company, he insinuated his case to the physician, as that of an imaginary individual.  <br><br>  ""'We will suppose,' said the miser, 'that his symptoms are such and such; now, doctor, what would you have directed him to take?'  <br><br>  ""'Take!' said Abernethy, 'why, take advice, to be sure.'""  <br><br>  ""But,"" said the Prefect, a little discomposed, ""I am perfectly willing to take advice, and to pay for it. I would really give fifty thousand francs to any one who would aid me in the matter.""  <br><br>  ""In that case,"" replied Dupin, opening a drawer, and producing a check-book, ""you may as well fill me up a check for the amount mentioned. When you have signed it, I will hand you the letter.""  <br><br>  I was astonished. The Prefect appeared absolutely thunder-stricken. For some minutes he remained speechless and motionless, looking incredulously at my friend with open mouth, and eyes that seemed startling from their sockets; then apparently recovering himself in some measure, he seized a pen, and after several pauses and vacant stares, finally filled up and signed a check for fifty thousand francs, and handed it across the table to Dupin. The latter examined it carefully and deposited it in his pocket-book; then, unlocking an escritoire, took thence a letter and gave it to the Prefect. This functionary grasped it in a perfect agony of joy, opened it with a trembling hand, cast a rapid glance at its contents, and then, scrambling and struggling to the door, rushed at length unceremoniously from the room and from the house, without having uttered a syllable since Dupin had requested him to fill up the check.  <br><br>  When he had gone, my friend entered into some explanations.  <br><br>  ""The Parisian police,"" he said, ""are exceedingly able in their way. They are persevering, ingenious, cunning, and thoroughly versed in the knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to demand. Thus, when G -- -- detailed to us his mode of searching the premises at the Hotel D -- -- , I felt entire confidence in his having made a satisfactory investigation -- so far as his labors extended.""  <br><br>  ""So far as his labors extended?"" said I.  <br><br>  ""Yes,"" said Dupin. ""The measures adopted were not only the best of their kind, but carried out to absolute perfection. Had the letter been deposited within the range of their search, these fellows would, beyond a question, have found it.""  <br><br>  I merely laughed -- but he seemed quite serious in all that he said.  <br><br>  ""The measures, then,"" he continued, ""were good in their kind, and well executed; their defect lay in their being inapplicable to the case and to the man. A certain set of highly ingenious resources are, with the Prefect, a sort of Procrustean bed, to which he forcibly adapts his designs. But he perpetually errs by being too deep or too shallow for the matter in hand; and many a school-boy is a better reasoner than he. I knew one about eight years of age, whose success at guessing in the game of 'even and odd' attracted universal admiration. This game is simple, and is played with marbles. One player holds in his hand a number of these toys, and demands of another whether that number is even or odd. If the guess is right, the guesser wins one; if wrong, he loses one. The boy to whom I allude won all the marbles of the school. Of course he had some principle of guessing; and this lay in mere observation and admeasurement of the astuteness of his opponents. For example, an arrant simpleton is his opponent, and, holding up his closed hand, asks, 'Are they even or odd?' Our school-boy replies, 'Odd,' and loses; but upon the second trial he wins, for he then says to himself: 'The simpleton had them even upon the first trial, and his amount of cunning is just sufficient to make him have them odd upon the second; I will therefore guess odd'; -- he guesses odd and wins. Now, with a simpleton a degree above the first, he would have reasoned thus: 'This fellow finds that in the first instance I guessed odd, and, in the second, he will propose to himself, upon the first impulse, a simple variation from even to odd, as did the first simpleton; but then a second thought will suggest that this is too simple a variation, and finally he will decide upon putting it even as before. I will therefore guess even'; -- he guesses even, and wins. Now this mode of reasoning in the school-boy, whom his fellows termed 'lucky,' -- what, in its last analysis, is it?""  <br><br>  ""It is merely,"" I said, ""an identification of the reasoner's intellect with that of his opponent.""  <br><br>  ""It is,"" said Dupin; ""and, upon inquiring of the boy by what means he effected the thorough identification in which his success consisted, I received answer as follows: 'When I wish to find out how wise, or how stupid, or how good, or how wicked is any one, or what are his thoughts at the moment, I fashion the expression of my face, as accurately as possible, in accordance with the expression of his, and then wait to see what thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart, as if to match or correspond with the expression.' This response of the school-boy lies at the bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been attributed to Rochefoucault, to La Bougive, to Machiavelli, and to Campanella.""  <br><br>  ""And the identification,"" I said, ""of the reasoner's intellect with that of his opponent, depends, if I understand you aright, upon the accuracy with which the opponent's intellect is admeasured.""  <br><br>  ""For its practical value it depends upon this,"" replied Dupin; ""and the Prefect and his cohort fail so frequently, first, by default of this identification, and, secondly, by ill-admeasurement, or rather through non-admeasurement, of the intellect with which they are engaged. They consider only their own ideas of ingenuity; and, in searching for any thing hidden, advert only to the modes in which they would have hidden it. They are right in this much -- that their own ingenuity is a faithful representative of that of the mass; but when the cunning of the individual felon is diverse in character from their own, the felon foils them, of course. This always happens when it is above their own, and very usually when it is below. They have no variation of principle in their investigations; at best, when urged by some unusual emergency -- by some extraordinary reward -- they extend or exaggerate their old modes of practice, without touching their principles. What, for example, in this case of D -- -- , has been done to vary the principle of action? What is all this boring, and probing, and sounding, and scrutinizing with the microscope, and dividing the surface of the building into registered square inches -- what is it all but an exaggeration of the application of the one principle or set of principles of search, which are based upon the one set of notions regarding human ingenuity, to which the Prefect, in the long routine of his duty, has been accustomed? Do you not see he has taken it for granted that all men proceed to conceal a letter, not exactly in a gimlet-hole bored in a chair-leg, but, at least, in some out-of-the-way hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought which would urge a man to secrete a letter in a gimlet-hole bored in a chair-leg? And do you not see also, that such recherchs nooks for concealment ar adapted only for ordinary occasions, and would be adopted by ordinary intellects; for, in all cases of concealment, a disposal of the article concealed -- a disposal in this recherch manner, -- is, in the very first instance, presumable and presumed; and thus its discovery depends, not at all upon the acumen, but altogether upon the mere care, patience, and determination of the seekers; and where the case is of importance -- or, what amounts to the same thing in the political eyes, when the reward is of magnitude, -- the qualities in question have never been known to fail. You will now understand what I mean in suggesting that, had the purloined letter been hidden anywhere within the limits of the Prefect's examination -- in other words, had the principle of its concealment been comprehended within the principles of the Prefect -- its discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond question. This functionary, however, has been thoroughly mystified; and the remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the Minister is a fool, because he has acquired renown as a poet. All fools are poets; this the Prefect feels; and he is merely guilty of a non distributio medii in thence inferring that all poets are fools.""  <br><br>  ""But is this really the poet?"" I asked. ""There are two brothers, I know; and both have attained reputation in letters. The minister I believe has written learnedly on the Differential Calculus. He is a mathematician, and no poet.""  <br><br>  ""You are mistaken; I know him well; he is both. As a poet and as a mathematician, he would reason well; as a mere mathematician, he could not have reasoned at all, and thus would have been at the mercy of the Prefect.""  <br><br>  ""You surprise me,"" I said, ""by these opinions, which have been contradicted by the voice of the world. You do not mean to set at naught the well-digested ideas of centuries. The mathematical reason has long been regarded as the reason par excellence.""  <br><br>  ""'Il y a  parier,'"" replied Dupin, quoting from Chamfort, ""'que toute ide publique, toute convention reue, est une sottise, cor elle a convenue au plus grand nombre.' The mathematicians, I grant you, have done their best to promulgate the popular error to which you allude, and which is none the less an error for its promulgation as truth. With an art worthy a better cause, for example, they have insinuated the term 'analysis' into application to algebra. The French are the originators of this particular deception; but if a term is of any importance -- if words derive any value from applicability -- then 'analysis' conveys 'algebra' about as much as, in Latin, 'ambitus' implies 'ambition,' 'religio' 'religion,' or 'homines honesti' a set of honorable men.""  <br><br>  ""You have a quarrel on hand, I see,"" said I, ""with some of the algebraists of Paris; but proceed.""  <br><br>  ""I dispute the availability, and thus the value, of that reason which is cultivated in any especial form other than the abstractly logical. I dispute, in particular, the reason educed by mathematical study. The mathematics are the science of form and quantity; mathematical reasoning is merely logic applied to observation upon form and quantity. The great error lies in supposing that even the truths of what is called pure algebra are abstract or general truths. And this error is so egregious that I am confounded at the universality with which it has been received. Mathematical axioms are not axioms of general truth. What is true of relation -- of form and quantity -- is often grossly false in regard to morals, for example. In this latter science it is very usually untrue that the aggregated parts are equal to the whole. In chemistry also the axiom fails. In the consideration of motive it fails; for two motives, each of a given value, have not, necessarily, a value when united, equal to the sum of their values apart. There are numerous other mathematical truths which are only truths within the limits of relation. But the mathematician argues from his finite truths, through habit, as if they were of an absolutely general applicability -- as the world indeed imagines them to be. Bryant, in his very learned 'Mythology,' mentions an analogous source of error, when he says that 'although the pagan fables are not believed, yet we forget ourselves continually, and make inferences from them as existing realities.' With the algebraists, however, who are pagans themselves, the 'pagan fables' are believed, and the inferences are made, not so much through lapse of memory as through an unaccountable addling of the brains. In short, I never yet encountered the mere mathematician who would be trusted out of equal roots, or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of his faith that x2   px was absolutely and unconditionally equal to q. Say to one of these gentlemen, by way of experiment, if you please, that you believe occasions may occur when x2   px is not altogether equal to q, and, having made him understand what you mean, get out of his reach as speedily as convenient, for beyond doubt, he will endeavor to knock you down.  <br><br>  ""I mean to say,"" continued Dupin, while I merely laughed at his last observations, ""that if the Minister had been no more than a mathematician, the Prefect would have been under no necessity of giving me this check. I knew him, however, as both mathematician and poet, and my measures were adapted to his capacity, with reference to the circumstances by which he was surrounded. I knew him as a courtier, too, and as a bold intriguant. Such a man, I considered, could not fail to be aware of the ordinary political modes of action. He could not fail to be anticipate -- and events have proved he did not fail to anticipate -- the waylayings to which he was subjected. He must have foreseen, I reflected, the secret investigations of his premises. His frequent absences from home at night, which were hailed by the Prefect as certain aids to his success, I regarded only as ruses, to afford opportunity for thorough search to the police, and thus sooner to impress them with the conviction to which G -- -- , in fact, did finally arrive -- the conviction that the letter was not upon the premises. I felt, also, that the whole train of thought, which I was at some pains in detailing to you just now, concerning the invariable principle of political action in searches for articles concealed -- I felt that this whole train of thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the minister. It would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinary nooks of concealment. He could not, I reflected, be so weak as not to see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would be as open as his commonest closets to the eyes, to the probes, to the gimlets, and to the microscopes of the Prefect. I saw, in fine, that he would be driven, as a matter of course, to simplicity, if not deliberately induced to it as a matter of choice. You will remember, perhaps, how desperately the Prefect laughed when I suggested, upon our first interview, that it was just possible this mystery troubled him so much on account of its being so very self-evident.""  <br><br>  ""Yes,"" said I, ""I remember his merriment well. I really thought he would have fallen into convulsions.""  <br><br>  ""The material world,"" continued Dupin, ""abounds with very strict analogies to the immaterial; and thus some color of truth has been given to the rhetorical dogma, that metaphor, or simile, may be made to strengthen an argument as well as to embellish a description. The principle of the vis inertiae, for example, seems to be identical in physics and metaphysics. It is not more true in the former, than a large body is with more difficulty set in motion than a smaller one, and that its subsequent momentum is commensurate with this difficulty, than it is, in the latter, that intellects of the vaster capacity, while more forcible, more constant, and more eventful in their movements than those of inferior grade, are yet the less readily moved, and more embarrassed, and full of hesitation in the first few steps of their progress. Again: have you ever noticed which of the street signs, over the shop doors, are the most attractive of attention?""  <br><br>  ""I have never given the matter a thought,"" I said.  <br><br>  ""There is a game of puzzles,"" he resumed, ""which is played upon a map. One party playing requires another to find a given word -- the name of town, river, state, or empire -- any word, in short, upon the motley and perplexed surface of the chart. A novice in the game generally seeks to embarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered names; but the adept selects such words as stretch, in large characters, from one end of the chart to the other. These, like the over-largely lettered signs and placards of the street, escape observation by dint of being excessively obvious; and here the physical oversight is precisely analogous with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers to pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and too palpably self-evident. But this is a point, it appears, somewhat above or beneath the understanding of the Prefect. He never once thought it probable, or possible, that the minister had deposited the letter immediately beneath the nose of the whole world, by way of best preventing any portion of that world from perceiving it.  <br><br>  ""But the more I reflected upon the daring, dashing, and discriminating ingenuity of D -- -- ; upon the fact that the document must always have been at hand, if he intended to use it to good purpose; and upon the decisive evidence, obtained by the Prefect, that it was not hidden within the limits of that dignitary's ordinary search -- the more satisfied I became that, to conceal this letter, the minister had resorted to the comprehensive and sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it at all.  <br><br>  ""Full of these ideas, I prepared myself with a pair of green spectacles, and called one fine morning, quite by accident, at the Ministerial hotel. I found D -- -- at home, yawning, lounging, and dawdling, as usual, and pretending to be in the last extremity of ennui. He is, perhaps, the most really energetic human being now alive -- but that is only when nobody sees him.  <br><br>  ""To be even with him, I complained of my weak eyes, and lamented the necessity of the spectacles, under cover of which I cautiously and thoroughly surveyed the whole apartment, while seemingly intent only upon the conversation of my host.  <br><br>  ""I paid especial attention to a large writing-table near where he sat, and upon which lay confusedly, some miscellaneous letters and other papers, with one or two musical instruments and a few books. Here, however, after a long and very deliberate scrutiny, I saw nothing to excite particular suspicion.  <br><br>  ""At length my eyes, in going the circuit of the room, fell upon a trumpery filigree card-rack of pasteboard, that hung dangling by a dirty blue ribbon, from a little brass knob just beneath the middle of the mantelpiece. In this rack, which had three or four compartments, were five or six visiting cards and a solitary letter. The last was much soiled and crumpled. It was torn nearly in two, across the middle -- as if a design, in the first instance, to tear it entirely up as worthless, had been altered, or stayed, in the second. It had a large black seal, bearing the D -- -- cipher very conspicuously, and was addressed, in a diminutive female hand, to D -- -- , the minister, himself. It was thrust carelessly, and even, as it seemed, contemptuously, into one of the uppermost divisions of the rack.  <br><br>  ""No sooner had I glanced at this letter than I concluded it to be that of which I was in search. To be sure, it was, to all appearance, radically different from the one of which the Prefect had read to us so minute a description. Here the seal was large and black, with the D -- -- cipher; there it was small and read, with the ducal arms of the S -- -- family. Here, the address, to the minister, was diminutive and feminine; there the superscription, to a certain royal personage, was markedly bold and decided; the size alone formed a point of correspondence. But, then, the radicalness of these differences, which was excessive; the dirt; the soiled and torn condition of the paper, so inconsistent with the true methodical habits of D -- -- , and so suggestive of a design to delude the beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of the document; -- these things, together with the hyperobtrusive situation of this document, full in the view of every visitor, and thus exactly in accordance with the conclusions to which I had previously arrived; these things, I say, were strongly corroborative of suspicion, in one who came with the intention to suspect.  <br><br>  ""I protracted my visit as long as possible, and, while I maintained a most animated discussion with the minister, upon a topic which I knew well had never failed to interest and excite him, I kept my attention really riveted upon the letter. In examination, I committed to memory its external appearance and arrangement in the rack; and also fell, at length, upon a discovery which set at rest whatever trivial doubt I might have entertained. In scrutinizing the edges of the paper, I observed them to be more chafed than seemed necessary. They presented the broken appearance which is manifested when a stiff paper, having been once folded and pressed with a folder, is refolded in a reversed direction, in the same creases or edges which had formed the original fold. This discovery was sufficient. It was clear to me that the letter had been turned, as a glove, inside out, re-directed and re-sealed. I bade the minister good-morning, and took my departure at once, leaving a gold snuff-box upon the table.  <br><br>  ""The next morning I called for the snuff-box, when we resumed, quite eagerly, the conversation of the preceding day. While thus engaged, however, a large report, as if of a pistol, was heard immediately beneath the windows of the hotel, and was succeeded by a series of fearful screams, and the shoutings of a terrified mod. D -- -- rushed to a casement, threw it open, and looked out. In the meantime I stepped to the card-rack, took the letter, put it in my pocket, and replaced it by a fac-simile, (so far as regards externals) which I had carefully prepared at my lodgings -- imitating the D -- -- cipher, very readily, by means of a seal formed of bread.  <br><br>  ""The disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic behavior of a man with a musket. He had fired it among a crowd of women and children. It proved, however, to have been without ball, and the fellow was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a drunkard. When he had gone, D -- -- came from the window, whither I had followed him immediately upon securing the object in view. Soon afterward I bade him farewell. The pretended lunatic was a man in my own pay.""  <br><br>  ""But what purpose had you,"" I asked, ""in replacing the letter by a fac-simile? Would it not have been better, at the first visit, to have seized it openly, and departed?""  <br><br>  ""D -- -- ,"" replied Dupin, ""is a desperate man, and a man of nerve. His hotel, too, is not without attendants devoted to his interests. Had I made the wild attempt you suggest, I might never have left the Ministerial presence alive. The good people of Paris might have heard of me no more. But I had an object apart from these considerations. You know my political prepossessions. In this matter, I act as a partisan of the lady concerned. For eighteen months the Minister has had her in his power. She has now him in hers -- since, being unaware that the letter is not in his possession, he will proceed with his exactions as if it was. Thus will he inevitably commit himself, at once, to his political destruction. His downfall, too, will not be more precipitate than awkward. It is all very well to talk about the facilis descensus Averni; but in all kinds of climbing, as Catalani said of singing, it is far more easy to get up than to come down. In the present instance I have no sympathy -- at least no pity -- for him who descends. He is that monstrum horrendum, an unprincipled man of genius. I confess, however, that I should like very well to know the precise character of his thoughts, when, being defied by her whom the Prefect terms 'a certain personage,' he is reduced to opening the letter which I left for him in the card-rack.""  <br><br>  ""How? did you put any thing particular in it?""  <br><br>  ""Why -- it did not seem altogether right to leave the interior blank -- that would have been insulting. D -- -- , at Vienna once, did me an evil turn, which I told him, quite good-humoredly, that I should remember. So, as I knew he would feel some curiosity in regard to the identity of the person who had outwitted him, I thought it a pity not to give him a clew. He is well acquainted with my MS., and I just copied into the middle of the blank sheet the words --  <br><br>  ""' -- -- -- -- Un dessein si funeste, S'il n'est digne d'Atre, est digne de Thyeste.'  <br><br>  They are to be found in Crbillon's 'Atre.'""                              <br><br>"
22,A Jury Of Her Peers - By Susan Glaspell,"When Martha Hale opened the storm-door and got a cut of the north wind,  she ran back for her big woolen scarf. As she hurriedly wound that round  her head her eye made a scandalized sweep of her kitchen. It was no  ordinary thing that called her away--it was probably further from  ordinary than anything that had ever happened in Dickson County. But  what her eye took in was that her kitchen was in no shape for leaving:  her bread all ready for mixing, half the flour sifted and half unsifted.<br><br>    She hated to see things half done; but she had been at that when the  team from town stopped to get Mr. Hale, and then the sheriff came  running in to say his wife wished Mrs. Hale would come too--adding, with  a grin, that he guessed she was getting scary and wanted another woman  along. So she had dropped everything right where it was.<br><br>    ""Martha!"" now came her husband's impatient voice. ""Don't keep folks  waiting out here in the cold.""<br><br>    She again opened the storm-door, and this time joined the three men and  the one woman waiting for her in the big two-seated buggy.<br><br>    After she had the robes tucked around her she took another look at the  woman who sat beside her on the back seat. She had met Mrs. Peters the  year before at the county fair, and the thing she remembered about her  was that she didn't seem like a sheriff's wife. She was small and thin  and didn't have a strong voice. Mrs. Gorman, sheriff's wife before  Gorman went out and Peters came in, had a voice that somehow seemed to  be backing up the law with every word. But if Mrs. Peters didn't look  like a sheriff's wife, Peters made it up in looking like a sheriff. He  was to a dot the kind of man who could get himself elected sheriff--a  heavy man with a big voice, who was particularly genial with the  law-abiding, as if to make it plain that he knew the difference between  criminals and non-criminals. And right there it came into Mrs. Hale's  mind, with a stab, that this man who was so pleasant and lively with all  of them was going to the Wrights' now as a sheriff.<br><br>    ""The country's not very pleasant this time of year,"" Mrs. Peters at last  ventured, as if she felt they ought to be talking as well as the men.<br><br>    Mrs. Hale scarcely finished her reply, for they had gone up a little  hill and could see the Wright place now, and seeing it did not make her  feel like talking. It looked very lonesome this cold March morning. It  had always been a lonesome-looking place. It was down in a hollow, and  the poplar trees around it were lonesome-looking trees. The men were  looking at it and talking about what had happened. The county attorney  was bending to one side of the buggy, and kept looking steadily at the  place as they drew up to it.<br><br>    ""I'm glad you came with me,"" Mrs. Peters said nervously, as the two  women were about to follow the men in through the kitchen door.<br><br>    Even after she had her foot on the door-step, her hand on the knob,  Martha Hale had a moment of feeling she could not cross that threshold.  And the reason it seemed she couldn't cross it now was simply because  she hadn't crossed it before. Time and time again it had been in her  mind, ""I ought to go over and see Minnie Foster""--she still thought of  her as Minnie Foster, though for twenty years she had been Mrs. Wright.  And then there was always something to do and Minnie Foster would go  from her mind. But <i>now</i> she could come.<br><br>    The men went over to the stove. The women stood close together by the  door. Young Henderson, the county attorney, turned around and said,  ""Come up to the fire, ladies.""<br><br>    Mrs. Peters took a step forward, then stopped. ""I'm not--cold,"" she said.<br><br>    And so the two women stood by the door, at first not even so much as  looking around the kitchen.<br><br>    The men talked for a minute about what a good thing it was the sheriff  had sent his deputy out that morning to make a fire for them, and then  Sheriff Peters stepped back from the stove, unbuttoned his outer coat,  and leaned his hands on the kitchen table in a way that seemed to mark  the beginning of official business. ""Now, Mr. Hale,"" he said in a sort  of semi-official voice, ""before we move things about, you tell Mr.  Henderson just what it was you saw when you came here yesterday morning.""<br><br>    The county attorney was looking around the kitchen.<br><br>    ""By the way,"" he said, ""has anything been moved?"" He turned to the  sheriff. ""Are things just as you left them yesterday?""<br><br>    Peters looked from cupboard to sink; from that to a small worn rocker a  little to one side of the kitchen table.<br><br>    ""It's just the same.""<br><br>    ""Somebody should have been left here yesterday,"" said the county attorney.<br><br>    ""Oh--yesterday,"" returned the sheriff, with a little gesture as of  yesterday having been more than he could bear to think of. ""When I had  to send Frank to Morris Center for that man who went crazy--let me tell  you. I had my hands full yesterday. I knew you could get back from Omaha  by today, George, and as long as I went over everything here myself--""<br><br>    ""Well, Mr. Hale,"" said the county attorney, in a way of letting what was  past and gone go, ""tell just what happened when you came here yesterday  morning.""<br><br>    Mrs. Hale, still leaning against the door, had that sinking feeling of  the mother whose child is about to speak a piece. Lewis often wandered  along and got things mixed up in a story. She hoped he would tell this  straight and plain, and not say unnecessary things that would just make  things harder for Minnie Foster. He didn't begin at once, and she  noticed that he looked queer--as if standing in that kitchen and having  to tell what he had seen there yesterday morning made him almost sick.<br><br>    ""Yes, Mr. Hale?"" the county attorney reminded.<br><br>    ""Harry and I had started to town with a load of potatoes,"" Mrs. Hale's  husband began.<br><br>    Harry was Mrs. Hale's oldest boy. He wasn't with them now, for the very  good reason that those potatoes never got to town yesterday and he was  taking them this morning, so he hadn't been home when the sheriff  stopped to say he wanted Mr. Hale to come over to the Wright place and  tell the county attorney his story there, where he could point it all  out. With all Mrs. Hale's other emotions came the fear now that maybe  Harry wasn't dressed warm enough--they hadn't any of them realized how  that north wind did bite.<br><br>    ""We come along this road,"" Hale was going on, with a motion of his hand  to the road over which they had just come, ""and as we got in sight of  the house I says to Harry, 'I'm goin' to see if I can't get John Wright  to take a telephone.' You see,"" he explained to Henderson, ""unless I can  get somebody to go in with me they won't come out this branch road  except for a price <i>I</i> can't pay. I'd spoke to Wright about it once  before; but he put me off, saying folks talked too much anyway, and all  he asked was peace and quiet--guess you know about how much he talked  himself. But I thought maybe if I went to the house and talked about it  before his wife, and said all the women-folks liked the telephones, and  that in this lonesome stretch of road it would be a good thing--well, I  said to Harry that that was what I was going to say--though I said at  the same time that I didn't know as what his wife wanted made much  difference to John--""<br><br>    Now there he was!--saying things he didn't need to say. Mrs. Hale tried  to catch her husband's eye, but fortunately the county attorney  interrupted with:<br><br>    ""Let's talk about that a little later, Mr. Hale. I do want to talk about  that but, I'm anxious now to get along to just what happened when you  got here.""<br><br>    When he began this time, it was very deliberately and carefully:<br><br>    ""I didn't see or hear anything. I knocked at the door. And still it was  all quiet inside. I knew they must be up--it was past eight o'clock. So  I knocked again, louder, and I thought I heard somebody say, 'Come in.'  I wasn't sure--I'm not sure yet. But I opened the door--this door,""  jerking a hand toward the door by which the two women stood. ""and there,  in that rocker""--pointing to it--""sat Mrs. Wright.""<br><br>    Everyone in the kitchen looked at the rocker. It came into Mrs. Hale's  mind that that rocker didn't look in the least like Minnie Foster--the  Minnie Foster of twenty years before. It was a dingy red, with wooden  rungs up the back, and the middle rung was gone, and the chair sagged to  one side.<br><br>    ""How did she--look?"" the county attorney was inquiring.<br><br>    ""Well,"" said Hale, ""she looked--queer.""<br><br>    ""How do you mean--queer?""<br><br>    As he asked it he took out a note-book and pencil. Mrs. Hale did not  like the sight of that pencil. She kept her eye fixed on her husband, as  if to keep him from saying unnecessary things that would go into that  note-book and make trouble.<br><br>    Hale did speak guardedly, as if the pencil had affected him too.<br><br>    ""Well, as if she didn't know what she was going to do next. And kind  of--done up.""<br><br>    ""How did she seem to feel about your coming?""<br><br>    ""Why, I don't think she minded--one way or other. She didn't pay much  attention. I said, 'Ho' do, Mrs. Wright? It's cold, ain't it?' And she  said. 'Is it?'--and went on pleatin' at her apron.<br><br>    ""Well, I was surprised. She didn't ask me to come up to the stove, or to  sit down, but just set there, not even lookin' at me. And so I said: 'I  want to see John.'<br><br>    ""And then she--laughed. I guess you would call it a laugh.<br><br>    ""I thought of Harry and the team outside, so I said, a little sharp,  'Can I see John?' 'No,' says she--kind of dull like. 'Ain't he home?'  says I. Then she looked at me. 'Yes,' says she, 'he's home.' 'Then why  can't I see him?' I asked her, out of patience with her now. 'Cause he's  dead' says she, just as quiet and dull--and fell to pleatin' her apron.  'Dead?' says, I, like you do when you can't take in what you've heard.<br><br>    ""She just nodded her head, not getting a bit excited, but rockin' back  and forth.<br><br>    ""'Why--where is he?' says I, not knowing <i>what</i> to say.<br><br>    ""She just pointed upstairs--like this""--pointing to the room above.<br><br>    ""I got up, with the idea of going up there myself. By this time  I--didn't know what to do. I walked from there to here; then I says:  'Why, what did he die of?'<br><br>    ""'He died of a rope around his neck,' says she; and just went on  pleatin' at her apron.""<br><br>    Hale stopped speaking, and stood staring at the rocker, as if he were  still seeing the woman who had sat there the morning before. Nobody  spoke; it was as if every one were seeing the woman who had sat there  the morning before.<br><br>    ""And what did you do then?"" the county attorney at last broke the silence.<br><br>    ""I went out and called Harry. I thought I might--need help. I got Harry  in, and we went upstairs."" His voice fell almost to a whisper. ""There he  was--lying over the--""<br><br>    ""I think I'd rather have you go into that upstairs,"" the county attorney  interrupted, ""where you can point it all out. Just go on now with the  rest of the story.""<br><br>    ""Well, my first thought was to get that rope off. It looked--""<br><br>    He stopped, his face twitching.<br><br>    ""But Harry, he went up to him, and he said. 'No, he's dead all right,  and we'd better not touch anything.' So we went downstairs.<br><br>    ""She was still sitting that same way. 'Has anybody been notified?' I  asked. 'No, says she, unconcerned.<br><br>    ""'Who did this, Mrs. Wright?' said Harry. He said it businesslike, and  she stopped pleatin' at her apron. 'I don't know,' she says. 'You don't  <i>know</i>?' says Harry. 'Weren't you sleepin' in the bed with him?' 'Yes,'  says she, 'but I was on the inside. 'Somebody slipped a rope round his  neck and strangled him, and you didn't wake up?' says Harry. 'I didn't  wake up,' she said after him.<br><br>    ""We may have looked as if we didn't see how that could be, for after a  minute she said, 'I sleep sound.'<br><br>    ""Harry was going to ask her more questions, but I said maybe that  weren't our business; maybe we ought to let her tell her story first to  the coroner or the sheriff. So Harry went fast as he could over to High  Road--the Rivers' place, where there's a telephone.""<br><br>    ""And what did she do when she knew you had gone for the coroner?"" The  attorney got his pencil in his hand all ready for writing.<br><br>    ""She moved from that chair to this one over here""--Hale pointed to a  small chair in the corner--""and just sat there with her hands held  together and lookin down. I got a feeling that I ought to make some  conversation, so I said I had come in to see if John wanted to put in a  telephone; and at that she started to laugh, and then she stopped and  looked at me--scared.""<br><br>    At the sound of a moving pencil the man who was telling the story looked up.<br><br>    ""I dunno--maybe it wasn't scared,"" he hastened: ""I wouldn't like to say  it was. Soon Harry got back, and then Dr. Lloyd came, and you, Mr.  Peters, and so I guess that's all I know that you don't.""<br><br>    He said that last with relief, and moved a little, as if relaxing.  Everyone moved a little. The county attorney walked toward the stair door.<br><br>    ""I guess we'll go upstairs first--then out to the barn and around there.""<br><br>    He paused and looked around the kitchen.<br><br>    ""You're convinced there was nothing important here?"" he asked the  sheriff. ""Nothing that would--point to any motive?""<br><br>    The sheriff too looked all around, as if to re-convince himself.<br><br>    ""Nothing here but kitchen things,"" he said, with a little laugh for the  insignificance of kitchen things.<br><br>    The county attorney was looking at the cupboard--a peculiar, ungainly  structure, half closet and half cupboard, the upper part of it being  built in the wall, and the lower part just the old-fashioned kitchen  cupboard. As if its queerness attracted him, he got a chair and opened  the upper part and looked in. After a moment he drew his hand away sticky.<br><br>    ""Here's a nice mess,"" he said resentfully.<br><br>    The two women had drawn nearer, and now the sheriff's wife spoke.<br><br>    ""Oh--her fruit,"" she said, looking to Mrs. Hale for sympathetic  understanding.<br><br>    She turned back to the county attorney and explained: ""She worried about  that when it turned so cold last night. She said the fire would go out  and her jars might burst.""<br><br>    Mrs. Peters' husband broke into a laugh.<br><br>    ""Well, can you beat the women! Held for murder, and worrying about her  preserves!""<br><br>    The young attorney set his lips.<br><br>    ""I guess before we're through with her she may have something more  serious than preserves to worry about.""<br><br>    ""Oh, well,"" said Mrs. Hale's husband, with good-natured superiority,  ""women are used to worrying over trifles.""<br><br>    The two women moved a little closer together. Neither of them spoke. The  county attorney seemed suddenly to remember his manners--and think of  his future.<br><br>    ""And yet,"" said he, with the gallantry of a young politician. ""for all  their worries, what would we do without the ladies?""<br><br>    The women did not speak, did not unbend. He went to the sink and began  washing his hands. He turned to wipe them on the roller towel--whirled  it for a cleaner place.<br><br>    ""Dirty towelsl Not much of a housekeeper, would you say, ladies?""<br><br>    He kicked his foot against some dirty pans under the sink.<br><br>    ""There's a great deal of work to be done on a farm,"" said Mrs. Hale  stiffly.<br><br>    ""To be sure. And yet""--with a little bow to her--'I know there are some  Dickson County farm-houses that do not have such roller towels."" He gave  it a pull to expose its full length again.<br><br>    ""Those towels get dirty awful quick. Men's hands aren't always as clean  as they might be.<br><br>    ""Ah, loyal to your sex, I see,"" he laughed. He stopped and gave her a  keen look, ""But you and Mrs. Wright were neighbors. I suppose you were  friends, too.""<br><br>    Martha Hale shook her head.<br><br>    ""I've seen little enough of her of late years. I've not been in this  house--it's more than a year.""<br><br>    ""And why was that? You didn't like her?""<br><br>    ""I liked her well enough,"" she replied with spirit. ""Farmers' wives have  their hands full, Mr. Henderson. And then--"" She looked around the kitchen.<br><br>    ""Yes?"" he encouraged.<br><br>    ""It never seemed a very cheerful place,"" said she, more to herself than  to him.<br><br>    ""No,"" he agreed; ""I don't think anyone would call it cheerful. I  shouldn't say she had the home-making instinct.""<br><br>    ""Well, I don't know as Wright had, either,"" she muttered.<br><br>    ""You mean they didn't get on very well?"" he was quick to ask.<br><br>    ""No; I don't mean anything,"" she answered, with decision. As she turned  a lit- tle away from him, she added: ""But I don't think a place would be  any the cheerfuller for John Wright's bein' in it.""<br><br>    ""I'd like to talk to you about that a little later, Mrs. Hale,"" he said.  ""I'm anxious to get the lay of things upstairs now.""<br><br>    He moved toward the stair door, followed by the two men.<br><br>    ""I suppose anything Mrs. Peters does'll be all right?"" the sheriff  inquired. ""She was to take in some clothes for her, you know--and a few  little things. We left in such a hurry yesterday.""<br><br>    The county attorney looked at the two women they were leaving alone  there among the kitchen things.<br><br>    ""Yes--Mrs. Peters,"" he said, his glance resting on the woman who was not  Mrs. Peters, the big farmer woman who stood behind the sheriff's wife.  ""Of course Mrs. Peters is one of us,"" he said, in a manner of entrusting  responsibility. ""And keep your eye out, Mrs. Peters, for anything that  might be of use. No telling; you women might come upon a clue to the  motive--and that's the thing we need.""<br><br>    Mr. Hale rubbed his face after the fashion of a showman getting ready  for a pleasantry.<br><br>    ""But would the women know a clue if they did come upon it?"" he said;  and, having delivered himself of this, he followed the others through  the stair door.<br><br>    The women stood motionless and silent, listening to the footsteps, first  upon the stairs, then in the room above them.<br><br>    Then, as if releasing herself from something strange. Mrs. Hale began to  arrange the dirty pans under the sink, which the county attorney's  disdainful push of the foot had deranged.<br><br>    ""I'd hate to have men comin' into my kitchen,"" she said  testily--""snoopin' round and criticizin'.""<br><br>    ""Of course it's no more than their duty,"" said the sheriff's wife, in  her manner of timid acquiescence.<br><br>    ""Duty's all right,"" replied Mrs. Hale bluffly; ""but I guess that deputy  sheriff that come out to make the fire might have got a little of this  on."" She gave the roller towel a pull. 'Wish I'd thought of that sooner!  Seems mean to talk about her for not having things slicked up, when she  had to come away in such a hurry.""<br><br>    She looked around the kitchen. Certainly it was not ""slicked up."" Her  eye was held by a bucket of sugar on a low shelf. The cover was off the  wooden bucket, and beside it was a paper bag--half full.<br><br>    Mrs. HaIe moved toward it.<br><br>    ""She was putting this in there,"" she said to herself--slowly.<br><br>    She thought of the flour in her kitchen at home--half sifted, half not  sifted. She had been interrupted, and had left things half done. What  had interrupted Minnie Foster? Why had that work been left half done?  She made a move as if to finish it,--unfinished things always bothered  her,--and then she glanced around and saw that Mrs. Peters was watching  her--and she didn't want Mrs. Peters to get that feeling she had got of  work begun and then--for some reason--not finished.<br><br>    ""It's a shame about her fruit,"" she said, and walked toward the cupboard  that the county attorney had opened, and got on the chair, murmuring: ""I  wonder if it's all gone.""<br><br>    It was a sorry enough looking sight, but ""Here's one that's all right,""  she said at last. She held it toward the light. ""This is cherries, too.""  She looked again. ""I declare I believe that's the only one.""<br><br>    With a sigh, she got down from the chair, went to the sink, and wiped  off the bottle.<br><br>    ""She'Il feel awful bad, after all her hard work in the hot weather. I  remember the afternoon I put up my cherries last summer.<br><br>    She set the bottle on the table, and, with another sigh, started to sit  down in the rocker. But she did not sit down. Something kept her from  sitting down in that chair. She straightened--stepped back, and, half  turned away, stood looking at it, seeing the woman who had sat there  ""pleatin' at her apron.""<br><br>    The thin voice of the sheriff's wife broke in upon her: ""I must be  getting those things from the front-room closet."" She opened the door  into the other room, started in, stepped back. ""You coming with me, Mrs.  Hale?"" she asked nervously. ""You--you could help me get them.""<br><br>    They were soon back--the stark coldness of that shut-up room was not a  thing to linger in.<br><br>    ""My!"" said Mrs. Peters, dropping the things on the table and hurrying to  the stove.<br><br>    Mrs. Hale stood examining the clothes the woman who was being detained  in town had said she wanted.<br><br>    ""Wright was close!"" she exclaimed, holding up a shabby black skirt that  bore the marks of much making over. ""I think maybe that's why she kept  so much to herself. I s'pose she felt she couldn't do her part; and  then, you don't enjoy things when you feel shabby. She used to wear  pretty clothes and be lively--when she was Minnie Foster, one of the  town girls, singing in the choir. But that--oh, that was twenty years ago.""<br><br>    With a carefulness in which there was something tender, she folded the  shabby clothes and piled them at one corner of the table. She looked up  at Mrs. Peters, and there was something in the other woman's look that  irritated her.<br><br>    ""She don't care,"" she said to herself. ""Much difference it makes to her  whether Minnie Foster had pretty clothes when she was a girl.""<br><br>    Then she looked again, and she wasn't so sure; in fact, she hadn't at  any time been perfectly sure about Mrs. Peters. She had that shrinking  manner, and yet her eyes looked as if they could see a long way into things.<br><br>    ""This all you was to take in?"" asked Mrs. Hale.<br><br>    ""No,"" said the sheriffs wife; ""she said she wanted an apron. Funny thing  to want, "" she ventured in her nervous little way, ""for there's not much  to get you dirty in jail, goodness knows. But I suppose just to make her  feel more natural. If you're used to wearing an apron--. She said they  were in the bottom drawer of this cupboard. Yes--here they are. And then  her little shawl that always hung on the stair door.""<br><br>    She took the small gray shawl from behind the door leading upstairs, and  stood a minute looking at it.<br><br>    Suddenly Mrs. Hale took a quick step toward the other woman, ""Mrs. Peters!""<br><br>    ""Yes, Mrs. Hale?""<br><br>    ""Do you think she--did it?'<br><br>    A frightened look blurred the other thing in Mrs. Peters' eyes.<br><br>    ""Oh, I don't know,"" she said, in a voice that seemed to shink away from  the subject.<br><br>    ""Well, I don't think she did,"" affirmed Mrs. Hale stoutly. ""Asking for  an apron, and her little shawl. Worryin' about her fruit.""<br><br>    ""Mr. Peters says--."" Footsteps were heard in the room above; she  stopped, looked up, then went on in a lowered voice: ""Mr. Peters  says--it looks bad for her. Mr. Henderson is awful sarcastic in a  speech, and he's going to make fun of her saying she didn't--wake up.""<br><br>    For a moment Mrs. Hale had no answer. Then, ""Well, I guess John Wright  didn't wake up--when they was slippin' that rope under his neck,"" she  muttered.<br><br>    ""No, it's <i>strange,</i>"" breathed Mrs. Peters. ""They think it was such  a--funny way to kill a man.""<br><br>    She began to laugh; at sound of the laugh, abruptly stopped.<br><br>    ""That's just what Mr. Hale said,"" said Mrs. Hale, in a resolutely  natural voice. ""There was a gun in the house. He says that's what he  can't understand.""<br><br>    ""Mr. Henderson said, coming out, that what was needed for the case was a  motive. Something to show anger--or sudden feeling.""<br><br>    'Well, I don't see any signs of anger around here,"" said Mrs. Hale, ""I  don't--"" She stopped. It was as if her mind tripped on something. Her  eye was caught by a dish-towel in the middle of the kitchen table.  Slowly she moved toward the table. One half of it was wiped clean, the  other half messy. Her eyes made a slow, almost unwilling turn to the  bucket of sugar and the half empty bag beside it. Things begun--and not  finished.<br><br>    After a moment she stepped back, and said, in that manner of releasing  herself:<br><br>    ""Wonder how they're finding things upstairs? I hope she had it a little  more red up up there. You know,""--she paused, and feeling gathered,--""it  seems kind of <i>sneaking:</i> locking her up in town and coming out here to  get her own house to turn against her!""<br><br>    ""But, Mrs. Hale,"" said the sheriff's wife, ""the law is the law.""<br><br>    ""I s'pose 'tis,"" answered Mrs. Hale shortly.<br><br>    She turned to the stove, saying something about that fire not being much  to brag of. She worked with it a minute, and when she straightened up  she said aggressively:<br><br>    ""The law is the law--and a bad stove is a bad stove. How'd you like to  cook on this?""--pointing with the poker to the broken lining. She opened  the oven door and started to express her opinion of the oven; but she  was swept into her own thoughts, thinking of what it would mean, year  after year, to have that stove to wrestle with. The thought of Minnie  Foster trying to bake in that oven--and the thought of her never going  over to see Minnie Foster--.<br><br>    She was startled by hearing Mrs. Peters say: ""A person gets  discouraged--and loses heart.""<br><br>    The sheriff's wife had looked from the stove to the sink--to the pail of  water which had been carried in from outside. The two women stood there  silent, above them the footsteps of the men who were looking for  evidence against the woman who had worked in that kitchen. That look of  seeing into things, of seeing through a thing to something else, was in  the eyes of the sheriff's wife now. When Mrs. Hale next spoke to her, it  was gently:<br><br>    ""Better loosen up your things, Mrs. Peters. We'll not feel them when we  go out.""<br><br>    Mrs. Peters went to the back of the room to hang up the fur tippet she  was wearing. A moment later she exclaimed, ""Why, she was piecing a  quilt,"" and held up a large sewing basket piled high with quilt pieces.<br><br>    Mrs. Hale spread some of the blocks on the table.<br><br>    ""It's log-cabin pattern,"" she said, putting several of them together,  ""Pretty, isn't it?""<br><br>    They were so engaged with the quilt that they did not hear the footsteps  on the stairs. Just as the stair door opened Mrs. Hale was saying:<br><br>    ""Do you suppose she was going to quilt it or just knot it?""<br><br>    The sheriff threw up his hands.<br><br>    ""They wonder whether she was going to quilt it or just knot it!""<br><br>    There was a laugh for the ways of women, a warming of hands over the  stove, and then the county attorney said briskly:<br><br>    ""Well, let's go right out to the barn and get that cleared up.""<br><br>    ""I don't see as there's anything so strange,"" Mrs. Hale said  resentfully, after the outside door had closed on the three men--""our  taking up our time with little things while we're waiting for them to  get the evidence. I don't see as it's anything to laugh about.""<br><br>    ""Of course they've got awful important things on their minds,"" said the  sheriff's wife apologetically.<br><br>    They returned to an inspection of the block for the quilt. Mrs. Hale was  looking at the fine, even sewing, and preoccupied with thoughts of the  woman who had done that sewing, when she heard the sheriff's wife say,  in a queer tone:<br><br>    ""Why, look at this one.""<br><br>    She turned to take the block held out to her.<br><br>    ""The sewing,"" said Mrs. Peters, in a troubled way, ""All the rest of them  have been so nice and even--but--this one. Why, it looks as if she  didn't know what she was about!""<br><br>    Their eyes met--something flashed to life, passed between them; then, as  if with an effort, they seemed to pull away from each other. A moment  Mrs. Hale sat there, her hands folded over that sewing which was so  unlike all the rest of the sewing. Then she had pulled a knot and drawn  the threads.<br><br>    ""Oh, what are you doing, Mrs. Hale?"" asked the sheriff's wife, startled.<br><br>    ""Just pulling out a stitch or two that's not sewed very good,"" said Mrs.  Hale mildly.<br><br>    ""I don't think we ought to touch things,"" Mrs. Peters said, a little  helplessly.<br><br>    ""I'll just finish up this end,"" answered Mrs. Hale, still in that mild,  matter-of-fact fashion.<br><br>    She threaded a needle and started to replace bad sewing with good. For a  little while she sewed in silence. Then, in that thin, timid voice, she  heard:<br><br>    ""Mrs. Hale!""<br><br>    ""Yes, Mrs. Peters?""<br><br>    'What do you suppose she was so--nervous about?""<br><br>    ""Oh, <i>I</i> don't know,"" said Mrs. Hale, as if dismissing a thing not  important enough to spend much time on. ""I don't know as she  was--nervous. I sew awful queer sometimes when I'm just tired.""<br><br>    She cut a thread, and out of the corner of her eye looked up at Mrs.  Peters. The small, lean face of the sheriff's wife seemed to have  tightened up. Her eyes had that look of peering into something. But next  moment she moved, and said in her thin, indecisive way:<br><br>    'Well, I must get those clothes wrapped. They may be through sooner than  we think. I wonder where I could find a piece of paper--and string.""<br><br>    ""In that cupboard, maybe,"" suggested to Mrs. Hale, after a glance around.<br><br>    One piece of the crazy sewing remained unripped. Mrs. Peter's back  turned, Martha Hale now scrutinized that piece, compared it with the  dainty, accurate sewing of the other blocks. The difference was  startling. Holding this block made her feel queer, as if the distracted  thoughts of the woman who had perhaps turned to it to try and quiet  herself were communicating themselves to her.<br><br>    Mrs. Peters' voice roused her.<br><br>    ""Here's a bird-cage,"" she said. ""Did she have a bird, Mrs. Hale?""<br><br>    'Why, I don't know whether she did or not."" She turned to look at the  cage Mrs. Peters was holding up. ""I've not been here in so long."" She  sighed. ""There was a man round last year selling canaries cheap--but I  don't know as she took one. Maybe she did. She used to sing real pretty  herself.""<br><br>    Mrs. Peters looked around the kitchen.<br><br>    ""Seems kind of funny to think of a bird here."" She half laughed--an  attempt to put up a barrier. ""But she must have had one--or why would  she have a cage? I wonder what happened to it.""<br><br>    ""I suppose maybe the cat got it,"" suggested Mrs. Hale, resuming her sewing.<br><br>    ""No; she didn't have a cat. She's got that feeling some people have  about cats--being afraid of them. When they brought her to our house  yesterday, my cat got in the room, and she was real upset and asked me  to take it out.""<br><br>    ""My sister Bessie was like that,"" laughed Mrs. Hale.<br><br>    The sheriff's wife did not reply. The silence made Mrs. Hale turn round.  Mrs. Peters was examining the bird-cage.<br><br>    ""Look at this door,"" she said slowly. ""It's broke. One hinge has been  pulled apart.""<br><br>    Mrs. Hale came nearer.<br><br>    ""Looks as if someone must have been--rough with it.""<br><br>    Again their eyes met--startled, questioning, apprehensive. For a moment  neither spoke nor stirred. Then Mrs. Hale, turning away, said brusquely:<br><br>    ""If they're going to find any evidence, I wish they'd be about it. I  don't like this place.""<br><br>    ""But I'm awful glad you came with me, Mrs. Hale."" Mrs. Peters put the  bird-cage on the table and sat down. ""It would be lonesome for  me--sitting here alone.""<br><br>    ""Yes, it would, wouldn't it?"" agreed Mrs. Hale, a certain determined  naturalness in her voice. She had picked up the sewing, but now it  dropped in her lap, and she murmured in a different voice: ""But I tell  you what I <i>do</i> wish, Mrs. Peters. I wish I had come over sometimes when  she was here. I wish--I had.""<br><br>    ""But of course you were awful busy, Mrs. Hale. Your house--and your  children.""<br><br>    ""I could've come,"" retorted Mrs. Hale shortly. ""I stayed away because it  weren't cheerful--and that's why I ought to have come. I""--she looked  around--""I've never liked this place. Maybe because it's down in a  hollow and you don't see the road. I don't know what it is, but it's a  lonesome place, and always was. I wish I had come over to see Minnie  Foster sometimes. I can see now--"" She did not put it into words.<br><br>    ""Well, you mustn't reproach yourself,"" counseled Mrs. Peters. ""Somehow,  we just don't see how it is with other folks till--something comes up.""<br><br>    ""Not having children makes less work,"" mused Mrs. Hale, after a silence,  ""but it makes a quiet house--and Wright out to work all day--and no  company when he did come in. Did you know John Wright, Mrs. Peters?""<br><br>    ""Not to know him. I've seen him in town. They say he was a good man.""<br><br>    ""Yes--good,"" conceded John Wright's neighbor grimly. ""He didn't drink,  and kept his word as well as most, I guess, and paid his debts. But he  was a hard man, Mrs. Peters. Just to pass the time of day with him--.""  She stopped, shivered a little. ""Like a raw wind that gets to the bone.""  Her eye fell upon the cage on the table before her, and she added,  almost bitterly: ""I should think she would've wanted a bird!""<br><br>    Suddenly she leaned forward, looking intently at the cage. ""But what do  you s'pose went wrong with it?""<br><br>    ""I don't know,"" returned Mrs. Peters; ""unless it got sick and died.""<br><br>    But after she said it she reached over and swung the broken door. Both  women watched it as if somehow held by it.<br><br>    ""You didn't know--her?"" Mrs. Hale asked, a gentler note in her voice.<br><br>    ""Not till they brought her yesterday,"" said the sheriff's wife.<br><br>    ""She--come to think of it, she was kind of like a bird herself. Real  sweet and pretty, but kind of timid and--fluttery. How--she--did--change.""<br><br>    That held her for a long time. Finally, as if struck with a happy  thought and relieved to get back to everyday things, she exclaimed:<br><br>    ""Tell you what, Mrs. Peters, why don't you take the quilt in with you?  It might take up her mind.""<br><br>    ""Why, I think that's a real nice idea, Mrs. Hale,"" agreed the sheriff's  wife, as if she too were glad to come into the atmosphere of a simple  kindness. ""There couldn't possibly be any objection to that, could  there? Now, just what will I take? I wonder if her patches are in  here--and her things?""<br><br>    They turned to the sewing basket.<br><br>    ""Here's some red,"" said Mrs. Hale, bringing out a roll of cloth.  Underneath that was a box. ""Here, maybe her scissors are in here--and  her things."" She held it up. ""What a pretty box! I'll warrant that was  something she had a long time ago--when she was a girl.""<br><br>    She held it in her hand a moment; then, with a little sigh, opened it.<br><br>    Instantly her hand went to her nose.<br><br>    ""Why--!""<br><br>    Mrs. Peters drew nearer--then turned away.<br><br>    ""There's something wrapped up in this piece of silk,"" faltered Mrs. Hale.<br><br>    ""This isn't her scissors,"" said Mrs. Peters, in a shrinking voice.<br><br>    Her hand not steady, Mrs. Hale raised the piece of silk. ""Oh, Mrs.  Peters!"" she cried. ""It's--""<br><br>    Mrs. Peters bent closer.<br><br>    ""It's the bird,"" she whispered.<br><br>    ""But, Mrs. Peters!"" cried Mrs. Hale. ""<i>Look</i> at it! Its <i>neck</i>--look at  its neck! It's all--other side <i>to</i>.""<br><br>    She held the box away from her.<br><br>    The sheriff's wife again bent closer.<br><br>    ""Somebody wrung its neck,"" said she, in a voice that was slow and deep.<br><br>    And then again the eyes of the two women met--this time clung together  in a look of dawning comprehension, of growing horror. Mrs. Peters  looked from the dead bird to the broken door of the cage. Again their  eyes met. And just then there was a sound at the outside door. Mrs. Hale  slipped the box under the quilt pieces in the basket, and sank into the  chair before it. Mrs. Peters stood holding to the table. The county  attorney and the sheriff came in from outside.<br><br>    ""Well, ladies,"" said the county attorney, as one turning from serious  things to little pleasantries, ""have you decided whether she was going  to quilt it or knot it?""<br><br>    ""We think,"" began the sheriff's wife in a flurried voice, ""that she was  going to--knot it.""<br><br>    He was too preoccupied to notice the change that came in her voice on  that last.<br><br>    ""Well, that's very interesting, I'm sure,"" he said tolerantly. He caught  sight of the bird-cage.<br><br>    ""Has the bird flown?""<br><br>    ""We think the cat got it,"" said Mrs. Hale in a voice curiously even.<br><br>    He was walking up and down, as if thinking something out.<br><br>    ""Is there a cat?"" he asked absently.<br><br>    Mrs. Hale shot a look up at the sheriff's wife.<br><br>    ""Well, not <i>now,</i>"" said Mrs. Peters. ""They're superstitious, you know;  they Ieave.""<br><br>    She sank into her chair.<br><br>    The county attorney did not heed her. ""No sign at all of anyone having  come in from the outside,"" he said to Peters, in the manner of  continuing an interrupted conversation. ""Their own rope. Now let's go  upstairs again and go over it, picee by piece. It would have to have  been someone who knew just the--""<br><br>    The stair door closed behind them and their voices were lost.<br><br>    The two women sat motionless, not looking at each other, but as if  peering into something and at the same time holding back. When they  spoke now it was as if they were afraid of what they were saying, but as  if they could not help saying it.<br><br>    ""She liked the bird,"" said Martha Hale, low and slowly. ""She was going  to bury it in that pretty box.""<br><br>    When I was a girl,"" said Mrs. Peters, under her breath, ""my  kitten--there was a boy took a hatchet, and before my eyes--before I  could get there--"" She covered her face an instant. ""If they hadn't held  me back I would have""--she caught herself, looked upstairs where  footsteps were heard, and finished weakly--""hurt him.""<br><br>    Then they sat without speaking or moving.<br><br>    ""I wonder how it would seem,"" Mrs. Hale at last began, as if feeling her  way over strange ground--""never to have had any children around?"" Her  eyes made a slow sweep of the kitchen, as if seeing what that kitchen  had meant through all the years ""No, Wright wouldn't like the bird,"" she  said after that--""a thing that sang. She used to sing. He killed that  too."" Her voice tightened.<br><br>    Mrs. Peters moved uneasily.<br><br>    ""Of course we don't know who killed the bird.""<br><br>    ""I knew John Wright,"" was Mrs. Hale's answer.<br><br>    ""It was an awful thing was done in this house that night, Mrs. Hale,""  said the sheriff's wife. ""Killing a man while he slept--slipping a thing  round his neck that choked the life out of him.""<br><br>    Mrs. Hale's hand went out to the bird cage.<br><br>    ""We don't <i>know</i> who killed him,"" whispered Mrs. Peters wildly. ""We  don't <i>know</i>.""<br><br>    Mrs. Hale had not moved. ""If there had been years and years of--nothing,  then a bird to sing to you, it would be awful--still--after the bird was  still.""<br><br>    It was as if something within her not herself had spoken, and it found  in Mrs. Peters something she did not know as herself.<br><br>    ""I know what stillness is,"" she said, in a queer, monotonous voice.  ""When we homesteaded in Dakota, and my first baby died--after he was two  years old--and me with no other then--""<br><br>    Mrs. Hale stirred.<br><br>    ""How soon do you suppose they'll be through looking for the evidence?""<br><br>    ""I know what stillness is,"" repeated Mrs. Peters, in just that same way.  Then she too pulled back. ""The law has got to punish crime, Mrs. Hale,""  she said in her tight little way.<br><br>    ""I wish you'd seen Minnie Foster,"" was the answer, ""when she wore a  white dress with blue ribbons, and stood up there in the choir and sang.""<br><br>    The picture of that girl, the fact that she had lived neighbor to that  girl for twenty years, and had let her die for lack of life, was  suddenly more than she could bear.<br><br>    ""Oh, I <i>wish</i> I'd come over here once in a while!"" she cried. ""That was  a crime! Who's going to punish that?""<br><br>    ""We mustn't take on,"" said Mrs. Peters, with a frightened look toward  the stairs.<br><br>    ""I might 'a' <i>known</i> she needed help! I tell you, it's <i>queer</i>, Mrs.  Peters. We live close together, and we live far apart. We all go through  the same things--it's all just a different kind of the same thing! If it  weren't--why do you and I <i>understand</i>? Why do we <i>know</i>--what we know  this minute?""<br><br>    She dashed her hand across her eyes. Then, seeing the jar of fruit on  the table she reached for it and choked out:<br><br>    ""If I was you I wouldn't <i>tell</i> her her fruit was gone! Tell her it  <i>ain't</i>. Tell her it's all right--all of it. Here--take this in to prove  it to her! She--she may never know whether it was broke or not.""<br><br>    She turned away.<br><br>    Mrs. Peters reached out for the bottle of fruit as if she were glad to  take it--as if touching a familiar thing, having something to do, could  keep her from something else. She got up, looked about for something to  wrap the fruit in, took a petticoat from the pile of clothes she had  brought from the front room, and nervously started winding that round  the bottle.<br><br>    ""My!"" she began, in a high, false voice, ""it's a good thing the men  couldn't hear us! Getting all stirred up over a little thing like  a--dead canary."" She hurried over that. ""As if that could have anything  to do with--with--My, wouldn't they <i>laugh</i>?""<br><br>    Footsteps were heard on the stairs.<br><br>    ""Maybe they would,"" muttered Mrs. Hale--""maybe they wouldn't.""<br><br>    ""No, Peters,"" said the county attorney incisively; ""it's all perfectly  clear, except the reason for doing it. But you know juries when it comes  to women. If there was some definite thing--something to show. Something  to make a story about. A thing that would connect up with this clumsy  way of doing it.""<br><br>    In a covert way Mrs. Hale looked at Mrs. Peters. Mrs. Peters was looking  at her. Quickly they looked away from each other. The outer door opened  and Mr. Hale came in.<br><br>    ""I've got the team round now,"" he said. ""Pretty cold out there.""<br><br>    ""I'm going to stay here awhile by myself,"" the county attorney suddenly  announced. ""You can send Frank out for me, can't you?"" he asked the  sheriff. ""I want to go over everything. I'm not satisfied we can't do  better.""<br><br>    Again, for one brief moment, the two women's eyes found one another.<br><br>    The sheriff came up to the table.<br><br>    ""Did you want to see what Mrs. Peters was going to take in?""<br><br>    The county attorney picked up the apron. He laughed.<br><br>    ""Oh, I guess they're not very dangerous things the ladies have picked out.""<br><br>    Mrs. Hale's hand was on the sewing basket in which the box was  concealed. She felt that she ought to take her hand off the basket. She  did not seem able to. He picked up one of the quilt blocks which she had  piled on to cover the box. Her eyes felt like fire. She had a feeling  that if he took up the basket she would snatch it from him.<br><br>    But he did not take it up. With another little laugh, he turned away,  saying:<br><br>    ""No; Mrs. Peters doesn't need supervising. For that matter, a sheriff's  wife is married to the law. Ever think of it that way, Mrs. Peters?""<br><br>    Mrs. Peters was standing beside the table. Mrs. Hale shot a look up at  her; but she could not see her face. Mrs. Peters had turned away. When  she spoke, her voice was muffled.<br><br>    ""Not--just that way,"" she said.<br><br>    ""Married to the law!"" chuckled Mrs. Peters' husband. He moved toward the  door into the front room, and said to the county attorney:<br><br>    ""I just want you to come in here a minute, George. We ought to take a  look at these windows.""<br><br>    ""Oh--windows,"" said the county attorney scoffingly.<br><br>    ""We'll be right out, Mr. Hale,"" said the sheriff to the farmer, who was  still waiting by the door.<br><br>    Hale went to look after the horses. The sheriff followed the county  attorney into the other room. Again--for one final moment--the two women  were alone in that kitchen.<br><br>    Martha Hale sprang up, her hands tight together, looking at that other  woman, with whom it rested. At first she could not see her eyes, for the  sheriff's wife had not turned back since she turned away at that  suggestion of being married to the law. But now Mrs. Hale made her turn  back. Her eyes made her turn back. Slowly, unwillingly, Mrs. Peters  turned her head until her eyes met the eyes of the other woman. There  was a moment when they held each other in a steady, burning look in  which there was no evasion or flinching. Then Martha Hale's eyes pointed  the way to the basket in which was hidden the thing that would make  certain the conviction of the other woman--that woman who was not there  and yet who had been there with them all through that hour.<br><br>    For a moment Mrs. Peters did not move. And then she did it. With a rush  forward, she threw back the quilt pieces, got the box, tried to put it  in her handbag. It was too big. Desperately she opened it, started to  take the bird out. But there she broke--she could not touch the bird.  She stood there helpless, foolish.<br><br>    There was the sound of a knob turning in the inner door. Martha Hale  snatched the box from the sheriff's wife, and got it in the pocket of  her big coat just as the sheriff and the county attorney came back into  the kitchen.<br><br>    ""Well, Henry,"" said the county attorney facetiously, ""at least we found  out that she was not going to quilt it. She was going to--what is it you  call it, ladies?""<br><br>    Mrs. Hale's hand was against the pocket of her coat.<br><br>    ""We call it--knot it, Mr. Henderson.""  						                               <br><br>"
23,On The Gull's Road - By Willa Cather,"IT often happens that one or another of my friends stops before a red chalk drawing in my study and asks me where I ever found so lovely a creature. I have never told the story of that picture to any one, and the beautiful woman on the wall, until yesterday, in all these twenty years has spoken to no one but me. Yesterday a young painter, a countryman of mine, came to consult me on a matter of business, and upon seeing my drawing of Alexandra Ebbling, straightway forgot his errand. He examined the date upon the sketch and asked me, very earnestly, if I could tell him whether the lady were still living. When I answered him, he stepped back from the picture and said slowly: <br><br> ""So long ago? She must have been very young. She was happy?"" <br><br> ""As to that, who can say -- about any one of us?"" I replied. ""Out of all that is supposed to make for happiness, she had very little."" <br><br> We returned to the object of his visit, but when he bade me goodbye at the door his troubled gaze again went back to the drawing, and it was only by turning sharply about that he took his eyes away from her. <br><br> I went back to my study fire, and as the rain kept away less impetuous visitors, I had a long time in which to think of Mrs. Ebbling. I even got out the little box she gave me, which I had not opened for years, and when Mrs. Hemway brought my tea I had barely time to close the lid and defeat her disapproving gaze. <br><br> My young countryman's perplexity, as he looked at Mrs. Ebbling, had recalled to me the delight and pain she gave me when I was of his years. I sat looking at her face and trying to see it through his eyes -- freshly, as I saw it first upon the deck of the Germania, twenty years ago. Was it her loveliness, I often ask myself, or her loneliness, or her simplicity, or was it merely my own youth? Was her mystery only that of the mysterious North out of which she came? I still feel that she was very different from all the beautiful and brilliant women I have known; as the night is different from the day, or as the sea is different from the land. But this is our story, as it comes back to me. <br><br> For two years I had been studying Italian and working in the capacity of clerk to the American legation at Rome, and I was going home to secure my first consular appointment. Upon boarding my steamer at Genoa, I saw my luggage into my cabin and then started for a rapid circuit of the deck. Everything promised well. The boat was thinly peopled, even for a July crossing; the decks were roomy; the day was fine; the sea was blue; I was sure of my appointment, and, best of all, I was coming back to Italy. All these things were in my mind when I stopped sharply before a chaise longue placed sidewise near the stern. Its occupant was a woman, apparently ill, who lay with her eyes closed, and in her open arm was a chubby little red-haired girl, asleep. I can still remember that first glance at Mrs. Ebbling, and how I stopped as a wheel does when the band slips. Her splendid, vigorous body lay still and relaxed under the loose folds of her clothing, her white throat and arms and red-gold hair were drenched with sunlight. Such hair as it was: wayward as some kind of gleaming seaweed that curls and undulates with the tide. A moment gave me her face; the high cheek-bones, the thin cheeks, the gentle chin, arching back to a girlish throat, and the singular loveliness of the mouth. Even then it flashed through me that the mouth gave the whole face its peculiar beauty and distinction. It was proud and sad and tender, and strangely calm. The curve of the lips could not have been cut more cleanly with the most delicate instrument, and whatever shade of feeling passed over them seemed to partake of their exquisiteness. <br><br> But I am anticipating. While I stood stupidly staring (as if, at twenty-five, I had never before beheld a beautiful woman) the whistles broke into a hoarse scream, and the deck under us began to vibrate. The woman opened her eyes, and the little girl struggled into a sitting position, rolled out of her mother's arm, and ran to the deck rail. After putting my chair near the stern, I went forward to see the gang-plank up and did not return until we were dragging out to sea at the end of a long tow-line. <br><br> The woman in the chaise longue was still alone. She lay there all day, looking at the sea. The little girl, Carin, played noisily about the deck. Occasionally she returned and struggled up into the chair, plunged her head, round and red as a little pumpkin, against her mother's shoulder in an impetuous embrace, and then struggled down again with a lively flourishing of arms and legs. Her mother took such opportunities to pull up the child's socks or to smooth the fiery little braids; her beautiful hands, rather large and very white, played about the riotous little girl with a quieting tenderness. Carin chattered away in Italian and kept asking for her father, only to be told that he was busy. <br><br> When any of the ship's officers passed, they stopped for a word with my neighbor, and I heard the first mate address her as Mrs. Ebbling. When they spoke to her, she smiled appreciatively and answered in low, faltering Italian, but I fancied that she was glad when they passed on and left her to her fixed contemplation of the sea. Her eyes seemed to drink the color of it all day long, and after every interruption they went back to it. There was a kind of pleasure in watching her satisfaction, a kind of excitement in wondering what the water made her remember or forget. She seemed not to wish to talk to any one, but I knew I should like to hear whatever she might be thinking. One could catch some hint of her thoughts, I imagined, from the shadows that came and went across her lips, like the reflection of light clouds. She had a pile of books beside her, but she did not read, and neither could I. I gave up trying at last, and watched the sea, very conscious of her presence, almost of her thoughts. When the sun dropped low and shone in her face, I rose and asked if she would like me to move her chair. She smiled and thanked me, but said the sun was good for her. Her yellow-hazel eyes followed me for a moment and then went back to the sea. <br><br> After the first bugle sounded for dinner, a heavy man in uniform came up the deck and stood beside the chaise longue, looking down at its two occupants with a smile of satisfied possession. The breast of his trim coat was hidden by waves of soft blond beard, as long and heavy as a woman's hair, which blew about his face in glittering profusion. He wore a large turquoise ring upon the thick hand that he rubbed good-humoredly over the little girl's head. To her he spoke Italian, but he and his wife conversed in some Scandinavian tongue. He stood stroking his fine beard until the second bugle blew, then bent stiffly from his hips, like a soldier, and patted his wife's hand as it lay on the arm of her chair. He hurried down the deck, taking stock of the passengers as he went, and stopped before a thin girl with frizzed hair and a lace coat, asking her a facetious question in thick English. They began to talk about Chicago and went below. Later I saw him at the head of his table in the dining room, the befrizzed Chicago lady on his left. They must have got a famous start at luncheon, for by the end of the dinner Ebbling was peeling figs for her and presenting them on the end of a fork. <br><br> The Doctor confided to me that Ebbling was the chief engineer and the dandy of the boat; but this time he would have to behave himself, for he had brought his sick wife along for the voyage. She had a bad heart valve, he added, and was in a serious way. <br><br> After dinner Ebbling disappeared, presumably to his engines, and at ten o'clock, when the stewardess came to put Mrs. Ebbling to bed, I helped her to rise from her chair, and the second mate ran up and supported her down to her cabin. About midnight I found the engineer in the card room, playing with the Doctor, an Italian naval officer, and the commodore of a Long Island yacht club. His face was even pinker than it had been at dinner, and his fine beard was full of smoke. I thought a long while about Ebbling and his wife before I went to sleep. <br><br> The next morning we tied up at Naples to take on our cargo, and I went on shore for the day. I did not, however, entirely escape the ubiquitous engineer, whom I saw lunching with the Long Island commodore at a hotel in the Santa Lucia. When I returned to the boat in the early evening, the passengers had gone down to dinner, and I found Mrs. Ebbling quite alone upon the deserted deck. I approached her and asked whether she had had a dull day. She looked up smiling and shook her head, as if her Italian had quite failed her. I saw that she was flushed with excitement, and her yellow eyes were shining like two clear topazes. <br><br> ""Dull? Oh, no! I love to watch Naples from the sea, in this white heat. She has just lain there on her hillside among the vines and laughed for me all day long. I have been able to pick out many of the places I like best."" <br><br> I felt that she was really going to talk to me at last. She had turned to me frankly, as to an old acquaintance, and seemed not to be hiding from me anything of what she felt. I sat down in a glow of pleasure and excitement and asked her if she knew Naples well. <br><br> ""Oh, yes! I lived there for a year after I was first married. My husband has a great many friends in Naples. But he was at sea most of the time, so I went about alone. Nothing helps one to know a city like that. I came first by sea, like this. Directly to Naples from Finmark, and I had never been South before."" Mrs. Ebbling stopped and looked over my shoulder. Then, with a quick, eager glance at me, she said abruptly: ""It was like a baptism of fire. Nothing has ever been quite the same since. Imagine how this bay looked to a Finmark girl. It seemed like the overture to Italy."" <br><br> I laughed. ""And then one goes up the country -- song by song and wine by wine."" <br><br> Mrs. Ebbling sighed. ""Ah, yes. It must be fine to follow it. I have never been away from the seaports myself. We live now in Genoa."" <br><br> The deck steward brought her tray, and I moved forward a little and stood by the rail. When I looked back, she smiled and nodded to let me know that she was not missing anything. I could feel her intentness as keenly as if she were standing beside me. <br><br> The sun had disappeared over the high ridge behind the city, and the stone pines stood black and flat against the fires of the afterglow. The lilac haze that hung over the long, lazy slopes of Vesuvius warmed with golden light, and films of blue vapor began to float down toward Baiae. The sky, the sea, and the city between them turned a shimmering violet, fading grayer as the lights began to glow like luminous pearls along the water-front, -- the necklace of an irreclaimable queen. Behind me I heard a low exclamation; a slight, stifled sound, but it seemed the perfect vocalization of that weariness with which we at last let go of beauty, after we have held it until the senses are darkened. When I turned to her again, she seemed to have fallen asleep. <br><br> That night, as we were moving out to sea and the tail lights of Naples were winking across the widening stretch of black water, I helped Mrs. Ebbling to the foot of the stairway. She drew herself up from her chair with effort and leaned on me wearily. I could have carried her all night without fatigue. <br><br> ""May I come and talk to you to-morrow?"" I asked. She did not reply at once. ""Like an old friend?"" I added. She gave me her languid hand, and her mouth, set with the exertion of walking, softened altogether. ""Grazia,"" she murmured. <br><br> I returned to the deck and joined a group of my countrywomen, who, primed with inexhaustible information, were discussing the baseness of Renaissance art. They were intelligent and alert, and as they leaned forward in their deck chairs under the circle of light, their faces recalled to me Rembrandt's picture of a clinical lecture. I heard them through, against my will, and then went to the stern to smoke and to see the last of the island lights. The sky had clouded over, and a soft, melancholy wind was rushing over the sea. I could not help thinking how disappointed I would be if rain should keep Mrs. Ebbling in her cabin to-morrow. My mind played constantly with her image. At one moment she was very clear and directly in front of me; the next she was far away. Whatever else I thought about, some part of my consciousness was busy with Mrs. Ebbling; hunting for her, finding her, losing her, then groping again. How was it that I was so conscious of whatever she might be feeling? that when she sat still behind me and watched the evening sky, I had had a sense of speed and change, almost of danger; and when she was tired and sighed, I had wished for night and loneliness. <br><br> II <br><br> Though when we are young we seldom think much about it, there is now and again a golden day when we feel a sudden, arrogant pride in our youth; in the lightness of our feet and the strength of our arms, in the warm fluid that courses so surely within us; when we are conscious of something powerful and mercurial in our breasts, which comes up wave after wave and leaves us irresponsible and free. All the next morning I felt this flow of life, which continually impelled me toward Mrs. Ebbling. After the merest greeting, however, I kept away. I found it pleasant to thwart myself, to measure myself against a current that was sure to carry me with it in the end. I was content to let her watch the sea -- the sea that seemed now to have come into me, warm and soft, still and strong. I played shuffleboard with the Commodore, who was anxious to keep down his figure, and ran about the deck with the stout legs of the little pumpkin-colored Carin about my neck. It was not until the child was having her afternoon nap below that I at last came up and stood beside her mother. <br><br> ""You are better to-day,"" I exclaimed, looking down at her white gown. She colored unreasonably, and I laughed with a familiarity which she must have accepted as the mere foolish noise of happiness, or it would have seemed impertinent. <br><br> We talked at first of a hundred trivial things, and we watched the sea. The coast of Sardinia had lain to our port for some hours and would lie there for hours to come, now advancing in rocky promontories, now retreating behind blue bays. It was the naked south coast of the island, and though our course held very near the shore, not a village or habitation was visible; there was not even a goat-herd's hut hidden away among the low pinkish sand hills. Pinkish sand hills and yellow head-lands; with dull-colored scrubby bushes massed about their bases and following the dried water-courses. A narrow strip of beach glistened like white paint between the purple sea and the umber rocks, and the whole island lay gleaming in the yellow sunshine and translucent air. Not a wave broke on that fringe of white sand, not the shadow of a cloud played across the bare hills. In the air about us, there was no sound but that of a vessel moving rapidly through absolutely still water. She seemed like some great sea-animal, swimming silently, her head well up. The sea before us was so rich and heavy and opaque that it might have been lapis lazuli. It was the blue of legend, simply; the color that satisfies the soul like sleep. <br><br> And it was of the sea we talked, for it was the substance of Mrs. Ebbling's story. She seemed always to have been swept along by ocean streams, warm or cold, and to have hovered about the edge of great waters. She was born and had grown up in a little fishing town on the Arctic ocean. Her father was a doctor, a widower, who lived with his daughter and who divided his time between his books and his fishing rod. Her uncle was skipper on a coasting vessel, and with him she had made many trips along the Norwegian coast. But she was always reading and thinking about the blue seas of the South. <br><br> ""There was a curious old woman in our village, Dame Ericson, who had been in Italy in her youth. She had gone to Rome to study art, and had copied a great many pictures there. She was well connected, but had little money, and as she grew older and poorer she sold her pictures one by one, until there was scarcely a well-to-do family in our district that did not own one of Dame Ericson's paintings. But she brought home many other strange things; a little orange-tree which she cherished until the day of her death, and bits of colored marble, and sea shells and pieces of coral, and a thin flask full of water from the Mediterranean. When I was a little girl she used to show me her things and tell me about the South; about the coral fishers, and the pink islands, and the smoking mountains, and the old, underground Naples. I suppose the water in her flask was like any other, but it never seemed so to me. It looked so elastic and alive, that I used to think if one unsealed the bottle something penetrating and fruitful might leap out and work an enchantment over Finmark."" <br><br> Lars Ebbling, I learned, was one of her father's friends. She could remember him from the time when she was a little girl and he a dashing young man who used to come home from the sea and make a stir in the village. After he got his promotion to an Atlantic liner and went South, she did not see him until the summer she was twenty, when he came home to marry her. That was five years ago. The little girl, Carin, was three. From her talk, one might have supposed that Ebbling was proprietor of the Mediterranean and its adjacent lands, and could have kept her away at his pleasure. Her own rights in him she seemed not to consider. <br><br> But we wasted very little time on Lars Ebbling. We talked, like two very young persons, of arms and men, of the sea beneath us and the shores it washed. We were carried a little beyond ourselves, for we were in the presence of the things of youth that never change; fleeing past them. To-morrow they would be gone, and no effort of will or memory could bring them back again. All about us was the sea of great adventure, and below us, caught somewhere in its gleaming meshes, were the bones of nations and navies . . . . . nations and navies that gave youth its hope and made life something more than a hunger of the bowels. The unpeopled Sardinian coast unfolded gently before us, like something left over out of a world that was gone; a place that might well have had no later news since the corn ships brought the tidings of Actium. <br><br> ""I shall never go to Sardinia,"" said Mrs. Ebbling. ""It could not possibly be as beautiful as this."" <br><br> ""Neither shall I,"" I replied. <br><br> As I was going down to dinner that evening, I was stopped by Lars Ebbling, freshly brushed and scented, wearing a white uniform, and polished and glistening as one of his own engines. He smiled at me with his own kind of geniality. ""You have been very kind to talk to my wife,"" he explained. ""It is very bad for her this trip that she speaks no English. I am indebted to you."" <br><br> I told him curtly that he was mistaken, but my acrimony made no impression upon his blandness. I felt that I should certainly strike the fellow if he stood there much longer, running his blue ring up and down his beard. I should probably have hated any man who was Mrs. Ebbling's husband, but Ebbling made me sick. <br><br> III <br><br> The next day I began my drawing of Mrs. Ebbling. She seemed pleased and a little puzzled when I asked her to sit for me. It occurred to me that she had always been among dull people who took her looks as a matter of course, and that she was not at all sure that she was really beautiful. I can see now her quick, confused look of pleasure. I thought very little about the drawing then, except that the making of it gave me an opportunity to study her face; to look as long as I pleased into her yellow eyes, at the noble lines of her mouth, at her splendid, vigorous hair. <br><br> ""We have a yellow vine at home,"" I told her, ""that is very like your hair. It seems to be growing while one looks at it, and it twines and tangles about itself and throws out little tendrils in the wind."" <br><br> ""Has it any name?"" <br><br> ""We call it love vine."" <br><br> How little a thing could disconcert her! <br><br> As for me, nothing disconcerted me. I awoke every morning with a sense of speed and joy. At night I loved to hear the swish of the water rushing by. As fast as the pistons could carry us, as fast as the water could bear us, we were going forward to something delightful; to something together. When Mrs. Ebbling told me that she and her husband would be five days in the docks in New York and then return to Genoa, I was not disturbed, for I did not believe her. I came and went, and she sat still all day, watching the water. I heard an American lady say that she watched it like one who is going to die, but even that did not frighten me: I somehow felt that she had promised me to live. <br><br> All those long blue days when I sat beside her talking about Finmark and the sea, she must have known that I loved her. I sat with my hands idle on my knees and let the tide come up in me. It carried me so swiftly that, across the narrow space of deck between us, it must have swayed her, too, a little. I had no wish to disturb or distress her. If a little, a very little of it reached her, I was satisfied. If it drew her softly, but drew her, I wanted no more. Sometimes I could see that even the light pressure of my thoughts made her paler. One still evening, after a long talk, she whispered to me, ""You must go and walk now, and -- don't think about me."" She had been held too long and too closely in my thoughts, and she begged me to release her for a little while. I went out into the bow and put her far away, at the sky line, with the faintest star, and thought of her gently across the water. When I went back to her, she was asleep. <br><br> But even in those first days I had my hours of misery. Why, for instance, should she have been born in Finmark, and why should Lars Ebbling have been her only door of escape? Why should she be silently taking leave of the world at the age when I was just beginning it, having had nothing, nothing of whatever is worth while? <br><br> She never talked about taking leave of things, and yet I sometimes felt that she was counting the sunsets. One yellow afternoon, when we were gliding between the shores of Spain and Africa, she spoke of her illness for the first time. I had got some magnolias at Gibraltar, and she wore a bunch of them in her girdle and the rest lay on her lap. She held the cool leaves against her cheek and fingered the white petals. ""I can never,"" she remarked, ""get enough of the flowers of the South. They make me breathless, just as they did at first. Because of them I should like to live a long while -- almost forever."" <br><br> I leaned forward and looked at her. ""We could live almost forever if we had enough courage. It's of our lives that we die. If we had the courage to change it all, to run away to some blue coast like that over there, we could live on and on, until we were tired."" <br><br> She smiled tolerantly and looked southward through half shut eyes. ""I am afraid I should never have courage enough to go behind that mountain, at least. Look at it, it looks as if it hid horrible things."" <br><br> A sea mist, blown in from the Atlantic, began to mask the impassive African coast, and above the fog, the grey mountain peak took on the angry red of the sunset. It burned sullen and threatening until the dark land drew the night about her and settled back into the sea. We watched it sink, while under us, slowly but ever increasing, we felt the throb of the Atlantic come and go, the thrill of the vast, untamed waters of that lugubrious and passionate sea. I drew Mrs. Ebbling's wraps about her and shut the magnolias under her cloak. When I left her, she slipped me one warm, white flower. <br><br> IV <br><br> From the Straits of Gibraltar we dropped into the abyss, and by morning we were rolling in the trough of a sea that drew us down and held us deep, shaking us gently back and forth until the timbers creaked, and then shooting us out on the crest of a swelling mountain. The water was bright and blue, but so cold that the breath of it penetrated one's bones, as if the chill of the deep under-fathoms of the sea were being loosed upon us. There were not more than a dozen people upon the deck that morning, and Mrs. Ebbling was sheltered behind the stern, muffled in a sea jacket, with drops of moisture upon her long lashes and on her hair. When a shower of icy spray beat back over the deck rail, she took it gleefully. <br><br> ""After all,"" she insisted, ""this is my own kind of water; the kind I was born in. This is first cousin to the Pole waters, and the sea we have left is only a kind of fairy tale. It's like the burnt out volcanoes; its day is over. This is the real sea now, where the doings of the world go on."" <br><br> ""It is not our reality, at any rate,"" I answered. <br><br> ""Oh, yes, it is! These are the waters that carry men to their work, and they will carry you to yours."" <br><br> I sat down and watched her hair grow more alive and iridescent in the moisture. ""You are pleased to take an attitude,"" I complained. <br><br> ""No, I don't love realities any more than another, but I admit them, all the same."" <br><br> ""And who are you and I to define the realities?"" <br><br> ""Our minds define them clearly enough, yours and mine, everybody's. Those are the lines we never cross, though we flee from the equator to the Pole. I have never really got out of Finmark, of course. I shall live and die in a fishing town on the Arctic ocean, and the blue seas and the pink islands are as much a dream as they ever were. All the same, I shall continue to dream them."" <br><br> The Gulf Stream gave us warm blue days again, but pale, like sad memories. The water had faded, and the thin, tepid sunshine made something tighten about one's heart. The stars watched us coldly, and seemed always to be asking me what I was going to do. The advancing line on the chart, which at first had been mere foolishness, began to mean something, and the wind from the west brought disturbing fears and forebodings. I slept lightly, and all day I was restless and uncertain except when I was with Mrs. Ebbling. She quieted me as she did little Carin, and soothed me without saying anything, as she had done that evening at Naples when we watched the sunset. It seemed to me that every day her eyes grew more tender and her lips more calm. A kind of fortitude seemed to be gathering about her mouth, and I dreaded it. Yet when, in an involuntary glance, I put to her the question that tortured me, her eyes always met mine steadily, deep and gentle and full of reassurance. That I had my word at last, happened almost by accident. <br><br> On the second night out from shore there was the concert for the Sailors' Orphanage, and Mrs. Ebbling dressed and went down to dinner for the first time, and sat on her husband's right. I was not the only one who was glad to see her. Even the women were pleased. She wore a pale green gown, and she came up out of it regally white and gold. I was so proud that I blushed when any one spoke of her. After dinner she was standing by her deck-chair talking to her husband when people began to go below for the concert. She took up a long cloak and attempted to put it on. The wind blew the light thing about, and Ebbling chatted and smiled his public smile while she struggled with it. Suddenly his roving eye caught sight of the Chicago girl, who was having a similar difficulty with her draperies, and he pranced half the length of the deck to assist her. I had been watching from the rail, and when she was left alone I threw my cigar away and wrapped Mrs. Ebbling up roughly. <br><br> ""Don't go down,"" I begged. ""Stay up here. I want to talk to you."" <br><br> She hesitated a moment and looked at me thoughtfully. Then, with a sigh, she sat down. Every one hurried down to the saloon, and we were absolutely alone at last, behind the shelter of the stern, with the thick darkness all about us and a warm east wind rushing over the sea. I was too sore and angry to think. I leaned toward her, holding the arm of her chair with both hands, and began anywhere. <br><br> ""You remember those two blue coasts out of Gibraltar? It shall be either one you choose, if you will come with me. I have not much money, but we shall get on somehow. There has got to be an end of this. We are neither one of us cowards, and this is humiliating, intolerable."" <br><br> She sat looking down at her hands, and I pulled her chair impatiently toward me. <br><br> ""I felt,"" she said at last, ""that you were going to say something like this. You are sorry for me, and I don't wish to be pitied. You think Ebbling neglects me, but you are mistaken. He has had his disappointments, too. He wants children and a gay, hospitable house, and he is tied to a sick woman who can not get on with people. He has more to complain of than I have, and yet he bears with me. I am grateful to him, and there is no more to be said."" <br><br> ""Oh, isn't there?"" I cried, ""and I?"" <br><br> She laid her hand entreatingly upon my arm. ""Ah, you! you! Don't ask me to talk about that. You -- "" Her fingers slipped down my coat sleeve to my hand and pressed it. I caught her two hands and held them, telling her I would never let them go. <br><br> ""And you meant to leave me day after tomorrow, to say goodbye to me as you will to the other people on this boat? You meant to cut me adrift like this, with my heart on fire and all my life unspent in me?"" <br><br> She sighed despondently. ""I am willing to suffer -- whatever I must suffer -- to have had you,"" she answered simply. ""I was ill -- and so lonely -- and it came so quickly and quietly. Ah, don't begrudge it to me! Do not leave me in bitterness. If I have been wrong, forgive me."" She bowed her head and pressed my fingers entreatingly. A warm tear splashed on my hand. It occurred to me that she bore my anger as she bore little Carin's importunities, as she bore Ebbling. What a circle of pettiness she had about her! I fell back in my chair and my hands dropped at my side. I felt like a creature with its back broken. I asked her what she wished me to do. <br><br> ""Don't ask me,"" she whispered. ""There is nothing that we can do. I thought you knew that. You forget that -- that I am too ill to begin my life over. Even if there were nothing else in the way, that would be enough. And that is what has made it all possible, our loving each other, I mean. If I were well, we couldn't have had even this much. Don't reproach me. Hasn't it been at all pleasant to you to find me waiting for you every morning, to feel me thinking of you when you went to sleep? Every night I have watched the sea for you, as if it were mine and I had made it, and I have listened to the water rushing by you, full of sleep and youth and hope. And everything you had done or said during the day came back to me, and when I went to sleep it was only to feel you more. You see there was never any one else; I have never thought of any one in the dark but you."" She spoke pleadingly, and her voice had sunk so low that I could scarcely hear her. <br><br> ""And yet you will do nothing,"" I groaned. ""You will dare nothing. You will give me nothing."" <br><br> ""Don't say that. When I leave you day after tomorrow, I shall have given you all my life. I can't tell you how, but it is true. There is something in each of us that does not belong to the family or to society, not even to ourselves. Sometimes it is given in marriage, and sometimes it is given in love, but oftener it is never given at all. We have nothing to do with giving or withholding it. It is a wild thing that sings in us once and flies away and never comes back, and mine has flown to you. When one loves like that, it is enough, somehow. The other things can go if they must. That is why I can live without you, and die without you."" <br><br> I caught her hands and looked into her eyes that shone warm in the darkness. She shivered and whispered in a tone so different from any I ever heard from her before or afterward: ""Do you grudge it to me? You are so young and strong, and you have everything before you. I shall have only a little while to want you in -- and I could want you forever and not weary."" I kissed her hair, her cheeks, her lips, until her head fell forward on my shoulder and she put my face away with her soft, trembling fingers. She took my hand and held it close to her, in both her own. We sat silent, and the moments came and went, bringing us closer and closer, and the wind and water rushed by us, obliterating our tomorrows and all our yesterdays. <br><br> The next day Mrs. Ebbling kept her cabin, and I sat stupidly by her chair until dark, with the rugged little girl to keep me company, and an occasional nod from the engineer. <br><br> I saw Mrs. Ebbling again only for a few moments, when we were coming into the New York harbor. She wore a street dress and a hat, and these alone would have made her seem far away from me. She was very pale, and looked down when she spoke to me, as if she had been guilty of a wrong toward me. I have never been able to remember that interview without heartache and shame, but then I was too desperate to care about anything. I stood like a wooden post and let her approach me, let her speak to me, let her leave me. She came up to me as if it were a hard thing to do, and held out a little package, timidly, and her gloved hand shook as if she were afraid of me. <br><br> ""I want to give you something,"" she said. ""You will not want it now, so I shall ask you to keep it until you hear from me. You gave me your address a long time ago, when you were making that drawing. Some day I shall write to you and ask you to open this. You must not come to tell me goodbye this morning, but I shall be watching you when you go ashore. Please don't forget that."" <br><br> I took the little box mechanically and thanked her. I think my eyes must have filled, for she uttered an exclamation of pity, touched my sleeve quickly, and left me. It was one of those strange, low, musical exclamations which meant everything and nothing, like the one that had thrilled me that night at Naples, and it was the last sound I ever heard from her lips. <br><br> An hour later I went on shore, one of those who crowded over the gang-plank the moment it was lowered. But the next afternoon I wandered back to the docks and went on board the Germania. I asked for the engineer, and he came up in his shirt sleeves from the engine room. He was red and dishevelled, angry and voluble; his bright eye had a hard glint, and I did not once see his masterful smile. When he heard my inquiry he became profane. Mrs. Ebbling had sailed for Bremen on the Hobenstauffen that morning at eleven o'clock. She had decided to return by the northern route and pay a visit to her father in Finmark. She was in no condition to travel alone, he said. He evidently smarted under her extravagance. But who, he asked, with a blow of his fist on the rail, could stand between a woman and her whim? She had always been a wilful girl, and she had a doting father behind her. When she set her head with the wind, there was no holding her; she ought to have married the Arctic Ocean. I think Ebbling was still talking when I walked away. <br><br> I spent that winter in New York. My consular appointment hung fire (indeed, I did not pursue it with much enthusiasm), and I had a good many idle hours in which to think of Mrs. Ebbling. She had never mentioned the name of her father's village, and somehow I could never quite bring myself to go to the docks when Ebbling's boat was in and ask for news of her. More than once I made up my mind definitely to go to Finmark and take my chance at finding her; the shipping people would know where Ebbling came from. But I never went. I have often wondered why. When my resolve was made and my courage high, when I could almost feel myself approaching her, suddenly everything crumbled under me, and I fell back as I had done that night when I dropped her hands, after telling her, only a moment before, that I would never let them go. <br><br> In the twilight of a wet March day, when the gutters were running black outside and the Square was liquefying under crusts of dirty snow, the housekeeper brought me a damp letter which bore a blurred foreign postmark. It was from Niels Nannestad, who wrote that it was his sad duty to inform me that his daughter, Alexandra Ebbling, had died on the second day of February, in the twenty-sixth year of her age. Complying with her request, he inclosed a letter which she had written some days before her death. <br><br> I at last brought myself to break the seal of the second letter. It read thus: <br><br> ""My Friend: -- <br><br> You may open now the little package I gave you. May I ask you to keep it? I gave it to you because there is no one else who would care about it in just that way. Ever since I left you I have been thinking what it would be like to live a lifetime caring and being cared for like that. It was not the life I was meant to live, and yet, in a way, I have been living it ever since I first knew you. <br><br> ""Of course you understand now why I could not go with you. I would have spoiled your life for you. Besides that, I was ill -- and I was too proud to give you the shadow of myself. I had much to give you, if you had come earlier. As it was, I was ashamed. Vanity sometimes saves us when nothing else will, and mine saved you. Thank you for everything. I hold this to my heart, where I once held your hand. Alexandra."" <br><br> The dusk had thickened into night long before I got up from my chair and took the little box from its place in my desk drawer. I opened it and lifted out a thick coil, cut from where her hair grew thickest and brightest. It was tied firmly at one end, and when it fell over my arm it curled and clung about my sleeve like a living thing set free. How it gleamed, how it still gleams in the firelight! It was warm and softly scented under my lips, and stirred under my breath like seaweed in the tide. This, and a withered magnolia flower, and two pink sea shells; nothing more. And it was all twenty years ago! <br><br>"
24,The Lottery - By Shirley Jackson,"  Shirley Jackson's short story <strong>The Lottery</strong> was published in 1948 and is not in the public domain.    <br><br>  Accordingly, we are prohibited from presenting the full text here in our short story collection, but we can present summary of the story, along with by some study questions, commentary and explanations.  <br><br>  <small style=""font-size:90%;""><em>  It is important to have some historical context to understand this story and the negative reaction that it generated when it was published in the June 26, 1948 issue of <span class=""al-periodical"">The New Yorker</span>. The setting for the story, a gathering in a small rural village, wasn't a fictional creation in America this story was published in the summer of 1948. The setting was emblematic of ""small town America."" It was customary at that time, for rural community leaders to organize summertime gatherings to draw people together in town centers to socialize, and to frequent and support some of the town's business establishments. It was thought to be good for the businesses and good for the community. These gatherings were usually organized by the city council and featured lotteries with modest cash-prizes to help lure people into their vehicles for the long drive to town. So the scene was instantly recognizable to readers -- especially rural readers -- when the story was published, and they did not like the way that this particular story developed and concluded. Many interpreted the story to be an attack on the values of rural communities. As a result the story engendered a great deal of anger and criticism. Here is the summary, which will be followed by additional commentary.  </em></small>    <br><br>  On a warm summer day, villagers gather in a town square to participate in a lottery. The village is small with about 300 residents and they are in an excited but anxious mood. We learn that this is an annual event and that some surrounding towns are thinking about abandoning the lottery. Mrs. (Tess) Hutchinson makes an undramatic entrace and chats briefly with Mrs. Delacroix, her friend.  <br><br>  The night before Mr. Summers, a town leader who officiates the lottery, had made paper slips listing all the families with the help of Mr. Graves (subtle name choice?). The slips were stored overnight in a safe at the coal company.   <br><br>   The villagers start to gather at 10 a.m. so that they may finish in time for lunch. Children busy themselves collecting stones -- one of those odd details that will later emerge loaded with meaning -- until the proceedings get underway and they are called together by their parents.   <br><br>  Mr. Summers works down the list of families, summoning the head man of each household. A male sixteen years or older comes forward and draws a slip of paper. When every family has a slip of paper, Mr. Summers has everyone look at the slip and we discover that Bill Hutchinson has drawn the one slip with a black spot. It's his family that has been chosen. Mrs. Hutchinson begins to protest. With tension mounting it becomes clear that ""winning"" this lottery isn't going to be what we expected, and that the ""winner"" isn't going to walk away with a pile of cash.  <br><br>  Once a family is chosen, the second round begins. In this round, each family member, no matter how old or young, must draw a slip of paper. It is Tess Hutchinson who draws the slip with the black circle. While Mrs. Hutchinson protests the unfairness of the situation, each of the villagers picks up a stone --  ""And someone gave little Davy Hutchinson a few pebbles"" --  and closes in on her. The story ends with Mrs. Hutchinson being stoned to death while protesting, ""It isn't fair, it isn't right."" The story concludes with six of the most famous words in short story history, ""And then they were upon her.""    <small style=""font-size:90%;""><em>  When the story was released it engendered a very strong negative reaction and backlash that manifested itself in subscribtion cancellations for <span class=""al-periodical"">The New Yorker</span> and large amounts of what could be described as ""hate mail"" for both the magazine and the author. Shirley Jackson and the editors at <span class=""al-periodical"">The New Yorker</span> were both surprised by the reaction. Even Jackson's mother was critical of the work. Here is an excerpt from Jackson herself:  <p>  <blockquote>  'It had simply never occurred to me that these millions and millions of people might be so far from being uplifted that they would sit down and write me letters I was downright scared to open; of the three-hundred-odd letters that I received that summer I can count only thirteen that spoke kindly to me, and they were mostly from friends. Even my mother scolded me: ""Dad and I did not care at all for your story in The New Yorker,"" she wrote sternly; ""it does seem, dear, that this gloomy kind of story is what all you young people think about these days. Why don't you write something to cheer people up?""'  </blockquote>  <p>  One literary critic described the story as ""a chilling tale of conformity gone mad."" Yes, that's a nice sound-bite to release in a classroom discussion, a book club gathering or a short story seminar but I honestly doubt that the letters received by Jackson in 1948 cursed her for writing a tale of 'conformity gone mad.' I do suspect that some people picked up and reacted strongly to the idea that Jackson might be suggesting that underneath the idyllic image of rural communities peopled by wholesome citizens, that there might be a sinister force waiting to be unleashed. The people in those communities certainly didn't see themselves that way. I suspect that some folks made simpler inferences about the story that they still found offensive; that the stones represented harmful gossip and insults, that these gatherings were a place where unfounded rumors could be born by chance and inflict real damage on those targeted; as gathering by gathering, a new ""target"" might become subject to slander earned or unearned.<p>  Jackson kept her intended meaning to herself, believing that it would emerge more clearly with the passage of time. But considering that she was genuinely surprised by the reaction, it seems logical to conclude that she intended to make a commentary on general human nature rather than a specific criticism of rural American communities in the mid-20th century.   <p>  Personally, I think the questions of permission and participation make for a great discussion or essay about this particular short story.

So the blame belongs to you as well. That is part of the foundation for many of the ideas he advocates in <a href=""/author/henry-david-thoreau/essay/on-civil-disobedience"" title=""Essay: On Civil Disobedience"">On Civil Disobedience</a>.  <p>  In <span class=""al-title"">The Lottery</span>, I see questions regarding the use of force: would <b>you</b> voluntarily participate in an annual lottery like this?

25,"Thank You, M'am - By Langston Hughes","<span class=""al-title""><i>""Thank You, Ma'am""</i></span> is a American short story written by Langston Hughes.<br><br>The story was published in 1958 and is not in the public domain. That's particularly unfortunate because not only is it a great example of the short story form in general, it's also one of those important short stories that carries great social value and has the ability to teach and instruct its readers. While we cannot publish the full text, fair use policy allows me to provide a summary and overview of the story.<br><br>The story features two characters; Roger and Mrs. Luella Bates Washington Jones.<br><br>They meet when Roger attempts to steal her purse as she is walking home late at night. Roger loses his balance, and Mrs. Jones, who seems to be a substantial woman, first kicks him in the behind as he is sprawled on the sidewalk, and then hauls him up and shakes him.  She has the boy pick up her purse, and begins to dress him down. Then the story takes a turn, <br><br>""Um-hum! And your face is dirty. I got a great mind to wash your face for you. Ain't you got nobody home to tell you to wash your face?""<br><br>""No'm,"" said the boy.<br><br>""Then it will get washed this evening,"" said the large woman starting up the street, dragging the frightened boy behind her.<br><br>And with those simple lines, Hughes affects a magical transformation turning a tough old black woman into everyone's mother and a young hoodlum into everyone's friend, brother or son. By explaining the crime -- it's out of a child's impoverished necessity -- and humanizing the characters, he makes us understand that Roger is not a bad kid as much as he is a kid trapped in difficult circumstances. <br><br>After a bit more physical and verbal trouncing, Mrs. Jones' course of action is clear:<br><br>""But you put yourself in contact with me,"" said the woman. ""If you think that that contact is not going to last awhile, you got another thought coming. When I get through with you, sir, you are going to remember Mrs. Luella Bates Washington Jones.""<br><br>Sweat popped out on the boy's face and he began to struggle.<br><br>Mrs. Jones puts the boy in a half-nelson and drags him up the street and into her house where the ""tough love"" lightens up on the toughness and starts to load up a bit on the love. She feeds him, lectures him gently, and gives him the money he was attempting to steal so that he may buy the blue suede shoes that he needs.<br><br>Then the story concludes:<br><br>She led him down the hall to the front door and opened it. ""Goodnight! Behave yourself, boy!"" she said, looking out into the street.<br><br>The boy wanted to say something else other than, ""Thank you, ma'am"" to Mrs. Luella Bates Washington Jones, but although his lips moved, he couldn't even say that as he turned at the foot of the barren stoop and looked back at the large woman in the door. Then she shut the door.<br><br>Although some sources cite 1933 as the date of publication, I believe the correct date is 1958. To put things in historical context, Martin Luther King Jr. was leading the burgeoning Civil Rights Movement following the Montgomery Bus Boycott of 1955, which followed on the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education ruling making segregation illegal (in law if not yet in practice). While it was not universal, the fact remains that there was a racial divide in the country and some white folks did harbor racial animosity towards blacks. Although often cast as a regional bias of the southern United States, it was a problem that found its home in larger cities throughout the country as well.<br><br>This story has always been particularly powerful to me due to an experience I had at a weekend market in an eastern city. One of the vendors there sold old black and white photographs, including old crime scene photos. As I looked through them, I began to notice the callous and even careless attitude displayed by the white detectives captured in the background of the photos with black victims. They were often captured smiling, enjoying a cigar or cigarette, waiting for the photographer to finish his business and their attitudes contrasted sharply with the seriousness they portrayed when white victims were involved. Those images stuck in my head, and made think about what things were like during that time (the photos were probably from the 1920s and 1930s).<br><br>I believe that one of the (several) wonderful thing that Langston Hughes did with <span class=""al-title""><i>""Thank You, Ma'am""</i></span> was to strike a perfect balance with the racial and moral elements of the story. The characters are unmistakably African-American but it is not a story about African-Americans. Skin color is present and well represented in vernacular, but that is not the story's point. He draws our attention to poverty -- why is an older woman having to work a job that causes her to walk home late at night, why can't a young boy be properly clothed, fed, and cared for -- but the poverty is part of the story without ever becoming an excuse. And that sets the stage for the message of the story, that respect, decency and love transcend race and class, that they are wonderful things that can cure all sorts of difficulties and hardships.<br><br>Departing further from the literary analysis, I have some additional thoughts related to this story.<br><br>The question of race relations in America is still decades away from being an easy one. Even today the complexity and contradictions are clear; we have a twice-elected black president but we also have ""the knock-out game"" raging in the background (Fall/Winter of 2013/2014). But no matter how difficult and complex that question remains, it will always find some answers in this simple short story by Langston Hughes that helps us to see that we are all the same and that no matter how difficult any one personal situation may be, it's probably a situation that can changed and improved with acts of kindness.<br><br>It's noteworthy to point out that the story may have some autobiographical elements for the author. This is not to suggest Langston Hughes was out mugging old ladies, but that he himself had been separated from his parents as a young boy and was forced to live with his grandmother who raised him. I'd like to imagine that some of his Mrs. Luella Bates Washington Jones' kindness was also present in his grandmother and that the hardships of his youth led to the tremendous empathy he put into this story.<br><br>"
26,All Gold Canyon,"It was the green heart of the canyon, where the walls swerved back from the  rigid plan and relieved their harshness of line by making a little sheltered  nook and filling it to the brim with sweetness and roundness and softness.  Here all things rested. Even the narrow stream ceased its turbulent down-rush  long enough to form a quiet pool. Knee-deep in the water, with drooping head  and half-shut eyes, drowsed a red-coated, many-antlered buck.      <br><br>On one side, beginning at the very lip of the pool, was a tiny meadow, a cool,  resilient surface of green that extended to the base of the frowning wall.  Beyond the pool a gentle slope of earth ran up and up to meet the opposing  wall. Fine grass covered the slope--grass that was spangled with flowers, with  here and there patches of color, orange and purple and golden. Below, the  canyon was shut in. There was no view. The walls leaned together abruptly and  the canyon ended in a chaos of rocks, moss-covered and hidden by a green  screen of vines and creepers and boughs of trees. Up the canyon rose far hills  and peaks, the big foothills, pine-covered and remote. And far beyond, like  clouds upon the border of the slay, towered minarets of white, where the  Sierra's eternal snows flashed austerely the blazes of the sun.    <br><br>There was no dust in the canyon. The leaves and flowers were clean and  virginal. The grass was young velvet. Over the pool three cottonwoods sent  their scurvy fluffs fluttering down the quiet air. On the slope the blossoms  of the wine-wooded manzanita filled the air with springtime odors, while the  leaves, wise with experience, were already beginning their vertical twist  against the coming aridity of summer. In the open spaces on the slope, beyond  the farthest shadow-reach of the manzanita, poised the mariposa lilies, like  so many flights of jewelled moths suddenly arrested and on the verge of  trembling into flight again. Here and there that woods harlequin, the madrone,  permitting itself to be caught in the act of changing its pea-green trunk to  madder-red, breathed its fragrance into the air from great clusters of waxen  bells. Creamy white were these bells, shaped like lilies-of-the-valley, with  the sweetness of perfume that is of the springtime.      <br><br>There was not a sigh of wind. The air was drowsy with its weight of perfume.  It was a sweetness that would have been cloying had the air been heavy and  humid. But the air was sharp and thin. It was as starlight transmuted into  atmosphere, shot through and warmed by sunshine, and flower-drenched with  sweetness.    <br><br>An occasional butterfly drifted in and out through the patches of light and  shade. And from all about rose the low and sleepy hum of mountain  bees--feasting Sybarites that jostled one another good-naturedly at the board,  nor found time for rough discourtesy. So quietly did the little stream drip  and ripple its way through the canyon that it spoke only in faint and  occasional gurgles. The voice of the stream was as a drowsy whisper, ever  interrupted by dozings and silences, ever lifted again in the awakenings.      <br><br>The motion of all things was a drifting in the heart of the canyon. Sunshine  and butterflies drifted in and out among the trees. The hum of the bees and  the whisper of the stream were a drifting of sound. And the drifting sound and  drifting color seemed to weave together in the making of a delicate and  intangible fabric which was the spirit of the place. It was a spirit of peace  that was not of death, but of smooth-pulsing life, of quietude that was not  silence, of movement that was not action, of repose that was quick with  existence without being violent with struggle and travail. The spirit of the  place was the spirit of the peace of the living, somnolent with the easement  and content of prosperity, and undisturbed by rumors of far wars.    <br><br>The red-coated, many-antlered buck acknowledged the lordship of the spirit of  the place and dozed knee-deep in the cool, shaded pool. There seemed no flies  to vex him and he was languid with rest. Sometimes his ears moved when the  stream awoke and whispered; but they moved lazily, with, foreknowledge that it  was merely the stream grown garrulous at discovery that it had slept.      <br><br>But there came a time when the buck's ears lifted and tensed with swift  eagerness for sound. His head was turned down the canyon. His sensitive,  quivering nostrils scented the air. His eyes could not pierce the green screen  through which the stream rippled away, but to his ears came the voice of a  man. It was a steady, monotonous, singsong voice. Once the buck heard the  harsh clash of metal upon rock. At the sound he snorted with a sudden start  that jerked him through the air from water to meadow, and his feet sank into  the young velvet, while he pricked his ears and again scented the air. Then he  stole across the tiny meadow, pausing once and again to listen, and faded away  out of the canyon like a wraith, soft-footed and without sound.    <br><br>The clash of steel-shod soles against the rocks began to be heard, and the  man's voice grew louder. It was raised in a sort of chant and became distinct  with nearness, so that the words could be heard:      <br><br>""Turn around an' tu'n yo' face<br>  Untoe them sweet hills of grace<br>  (D' pow'rs of sin yo' am scornin'!).<br>  Look about an' look aroun',<br>  Fling yo' sin-pack on d' groun'<br>  (Yo' will meet wid d' Lord in d' mornin'!).""    <br><br>A sound of scrambling accompanied the song, and the spirit of the place fled  away on the heels of the red-coated buck. The green screen was burst asunder,  and a man peered out at the meadow and the pool and the sloping side-hill. He  was a deliberate sort of man. He took in the scene with one embracing glance,  then ran his eyes over the details to verify the general impression. Then, and  not until then, did he open his mouth in vivid and solemn approval:      <br><br>""Smoke of life an' snakes of purgatory! Will you just look at that! Wood an'  water an' grass an' a side-hill! A pocket-hunter's delight an' a cayuse's  paradise! Cool green for tired eyes! Pink pills for pale people ain't in it. A  secret pasture for prospectors and a resting-place for tired burros, by damn!""    <br><br>He was a sandy-complexioned man in whose face geniality and humor seemed the  salient characteristics. It was a mobile face, quick-changing to inward mood  and thought. Thinking was in him a visible process. Ideas chased across his  face like wind-flaws across the surface of a lake. His hair, sparse and  unkempt of growth, was as indeterminate and colorless as his complexion. It  would seem that all the color of his frame had gone into his eyes, for they  were startlingly blue. Also, they were laughing and merry eyes, within them  much of the naivete and wonder of the child; and yet, in an unassertive way.  they contained much of calm self-reliance and strength of purpose founded upon  self-experience and experience of the world.      <br><br>>From out the screen of vines and creepers he flung ahead of him a miner's  pick and shovel and gold-pan. Then he crawled out himself into the open. He  was clad in faded overalls and black cotton shirt, with hobnailed brogans on  his feet, and on his head a hat whose shapelessness and stains advertised the  rough usage of wind and rain and sun and camp-smoke. He stood erect, seeing  wide-eyed the secrecy of the scene and sensuously inhaling the warm, sweet  breath of the canyon-garden through nostrils that dilated and quivered with  delight. His eyes narrowed to laughing slits of blue, his face wreathed itself  in joy, and his mouth curled in a smile as he cried aloud:    <br><br>""Jumping dandelions and happy hollyhocks, but that smells good to me! Talk  about your attar o' roses an' cologne factories! They ain't in it!""      <br><br>He had the habit of soliloquy. His quick-changing facial expressions might  tell every thought and mood, but the tongue, perforce, ran hard after,  repeating, like a second Boswell.    <br><br>The man lay down on the lip of the pool and drank long and deep of its water.  ""Tastes good to me,"" he murmured, lifting his head and gazing across the pool  at the side-hill, while he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. The  side-hill attracted his attention. Still lying on his stomach, he studied the  hill formation long and carefully. It was a practised eye that travelled up  the slope to the crumbling canyon-wall and back and down again to the edge of  the pool. He scrambled to his feet and favored the side-hill with a second  survey.      <br><br>""Looks good to me,"" he concluded, picking up his pick and shovel and gold-pan.    <br><br>He crossed the stream below the pool, stepping agilely from stone to stone.  Where the sidehill touched the water he dug up a shovelful of dirt and put it  into the gold-pan. He squatted down, holding the pan in his two hands, and  partly immersing it in the stream. Then he imparted to the pan a deft circular  motion that sent the water sluicing in and out through the dirt and gravel.  The larger and the lighter particles worked to the surface, and these, by a  skilful dipping movement of the pan, he spilled out and over the edge.  Occasionally, to expedite matters, he rested the pan and with his fingers  raked out the large pebbles and pieces of rock.      <br><br>The contents of the pan diminished rapidly until only fine dirt and the  smallest bits of gravel remained. At this stage he began to work very  deliberately and carefully. It was fine washing, and he washed fine and finer,  with a keen scrutiny and delicate and fastidious touch. At last the pan seemed  empty of everything but water; but with a quick semicircular flirt that sent  the water flying over the shallow rim into the stream, he disclosed a layer of  black sand on the bottom of the pan. So thin was this layer that it was like a  streak of paint. He examined it closely. In the midst of it was a tiny golden  speck. He dribbled a little water in over the depressed edge of the pan. With  a quick flirt he sent the water sluicing across the bottom, turning the grains  of black sand over and over A second tiny golden speck rewarded his effort.    <br><br>The washing had now become very fine--fine beyond all need of ordinary  placer-mining. He worked the black sand, a small portion at a time, up the  shallow rim of the pan. Each small portion he examined sharply, so that his  eyes saw every grain of it before he allowed it to slide over the edge and  away. Jealously, bit by bit, he let the black sand slip away. A golden speck,  no larger than a pin-point, appeared on the rim, and by his manipulation of  the riveter it returned to the bottom of tile pan. And in such fashion another  speck was disclosed, and another. Great was his care of them. Like a shepherd  he herded his flock of golden specks so that not one should be lost. At last,  of the pan of dirt nothing remained but his golden herd. He counted it, and  then, after all his labor, sent it flying out of the pan with one final swirl  of water.      <br><br>But his blue eyes were shining with desire as he rose to his feet. ""Seven,"" he  muttered aloud, asserting the sum of the specks for which he had toiled so  hard and which he had so wantonly thrown away. ""Seven,"" he repeated, with the  emphasis of one trying to impress a number on his memory.    <br><br>He stood still a long while, surveying the hill-side. In his eyes was a  curiosity, new-aroused and burning. There was an exultance about his bearing  and a keenness like that of a hunting animal catching the fresh scent of game.      <br><br>He moved down the stream a few steps and took a second panful of dirt.    <br><br>Again came the careful washing, the jealous herding of the golden specks, and  the wantonness with which he sent them flying into the stream when he had  counted their number.      <br><br>""Five,"" he muttered, and repeated, ""five.""    <br><br>He could not forbear another survey of the hill before filling the pan farther  down the stream. His golden herds diminished. "" Four, three, two, two, one,""  were his memory-tabulations as he moved down the stream. When but one speck of  gold rewarded his washing, he stopped and built a fire of dry twigs. Into this  he thrust the gold-pan and burned it till it was blue-black. He held up the  pan and examined it critically. Then he nodded approbation. Against such a  color-background he could defy the tiniest yellow speck to elude him.      <br><br>Still moving down the stream, he panned again. A single speck was his reward.  A third pan contained no gold at all. Not satisfied with this, he panned three  times again, taking his shovels of dirt within a foot of one another. Each pan  proved empty of gold, and the fact, instead of discouraging him, seemed to  give him satisfaction. His elation increased with each barren washing, until  he arose, exclaiming jubilantly:    <br><br>""If it ain't the real thing, may God knock off my head with sour apples!""      <br><br>Returning to where he had started operations, he began to pan up the stream.  At first his golden herds increased--increased prodigiously. "" Fourteen,  eighteen, twenty-one, twenty-six,"" ran his memory tabulations. Just above the  pool he struck his richest pan--thirty-five colors.    <br><br>""Almost enough to save,"" he remarked regretfully as he allowed the water to  sweep them away.      <br><br>The sun climbed to the top of the sky. The man worked on. Pan by pan, he went  up the stream, the tally of results steadily decreasing.    <br><br>""It's just booful, the way it peters out,"" he exulted when a shovelful of dirt  contained no more than a single speck of gold.      <br><br>And when no specks at all were found in several pans, he straightened up and  favored the hillside with a confident glance.    <br><br>""Ah, ha! Mr. Pocket!"" he cried out, as though to an auditor hidden somewhere  above him beneath the surface of the slope. ""Ah, ha! Mr. Pocket! I'm a-comin',  I'm a-comin', an' I'm shorely gwine to get yer! You heah me, Mr. Pocket? I'm  gwine to get yer as shore as punkins ain't cauliflowers!""      <br><br>He turned and flung a measuring glance at the sun poised above him in the  azure of the cloudless sky. Then he went down the canyon, following the line  of shovel-holes he had made in filling the pans. He crossed the stream below  the pool and disappeared through the green screen. There was little  opportunity for the spirit of the place to return with its quietude and  repose, for the man's voice, raised in ragtime song, still dominated the  canyon with possession.    <br><br>After a time, with a greater clashing of steel-shod feet on rock, he returned.  The green screen was tremendously agitated. It surged back and forth in the  throes of a struggle. There was a loud grating and clanging of metal. The  man's voice leaped to a higher pitch and was sharp with imperativeness. A  large body plunged and panted. There was a snapping and ripping and rending,  and amid a shower of falling leaves a horse burst through the screen. On its  back was a pack, and from this trailed broken vines and torn creepers. The  animal gazed with astonished eyes at the scene into which it had been  precipitated, then dropped its head to the grass and began contentedly to  graze. A second horse scrambled into view, slipping once on the mossy rocks  and regaining equilibrium when its hoofs sank into the yielding surface of the  meadow. It was riderless, though on its back was a high-horned Mexican saddle,  scarred and discolored by long usage.      <br><br>The man brought up the rear. He threw off pack and saddle, with an eye to camp  location, and gave the animals their freedom to graze. He unpacked his food  and got out frying-pan and coffee-pot. He gathered an armful of dry wood, and  with a few stones made a place for his fire.    <br><br>""My!"" he said, ""but I've got an appetite. I could scoff iron-filings an'  horseshoe nails an' thank you kindly, ma'am, for a second helpin'.""      <br><br>He straightened up, and, while he reached for matches in the pocket of his  overalls, his eyes travelled across the pool to the side-hill. His fingers had  clutched the match-box, but they relaxed their hold and the hand came out  empty. The man wavered perceptibly. He looked at his preparations for cooking  and he looked at the hill.    <br><br>""Guess I'll take another whack at her,"" he concluded, starting to cross the  stream.      <br><br>""They ain't no sense in it, I know,"" he mumbled apologetically. ""But keepin'  grub back an hour ain't goin' to hurt none, I reckon.""    <br><br>A few feet back from his first line of test-pans he started a second line. The  sun dropped down the western sky, the shadows lengthened, but the man worked  on. He began a third line of test-pans. He was cross-cutting the hillside,  line by line, as he ascended. The centre of each line produced the richest  pans, while the ends came where no colors showed in the pan. And as he  ascended the hillside the lines grew perceptibly shorter. The regularity with  which their length diminished served to indicate that somewhere up the slope  the last line would be so short as to have scarcely length at all, and that  beyond could come only a point. The design was growing into an inverted ""V.""  The converging sides of this ""V"" marked the boundaries of the gold-bearing  dirt.      <br><br>The apex of the ""V"" was evidently the man's goal. Often he ran his eye along  the converging sides and on up the hill, trying to divine the apex, the point  where the gold-bearing dirt must cease. Here resided ""Mr. Pocket""--for so the  man familiarly addressed the imaginary point above him on the slope, crying  out:    <br><br>""Come down out o' that, Mr. Pocket! Be right smart an' agreeable, an' come  down!""      <br><br>""All right,"" he would add later, in a voice resigned to determination. ""All  right, Mr. Pocket. It's plain to me I got to come right up an' snatch you out  bald-headed. An' I'll do it! I'll do it!"" he would threaten still later.    <br><br>Each pan he carried down to the water to wash, and as he went higher up the  hill the pans grew richer, until he began to save the gold in an empty  baking-powder can which he carried carelessly in his hip-pocket. So engrossed  was he in his toil that he did not notice the long twilight of oncoming night.  It was not until he tried vainly to see the gold colors in the bottom of the  pan that he realized the passage of time. He straightened up abruptly. An  expression of whimsical wonderment and awe overspread his face as he drawled:      <br><br>""Gosh darn my buttons! if I didn't plumb forget dinner!""    <br><br>He stumbled across the stream in the darkness and lighted his long-delayed  fire. Flapjacks and bacon and warmed-over beans constituted his supper. Then  he smoked a pipe by the smouldering coals, listening to the night noises and  watching the moonlight stream through the canyon. After that he unrolled his  bed, took off his heavy shoes, and pulled the blankets up to his chin. His  face showed white in the moonlight, like the face of a corpse. But it was a  corpse that knew its resurrection, for the man rose suddenly on one elbow and  gazed across at his hillside.      <br><br>""Good night, Mr. Pocket,"" he called sleepily. ""Good night.""    <br><br>He slept through the early gray of morning until the direct rays of the sun  smote his closed eyelids, when he awoke with a start and looked about him  until he had established the continuity of his existence and identified his  present self with the days previously lived.      <br><br>To dress, he had merely to buckle on his shoes. He glanced at his fireplace  and at his hillside, wavered, but fought down the temptation and started the  fire.    <br><br>""Keep yer shirt on, Bill; keep yer shirt on,"" he admonished himself. ""What's  the good of rushin'? No use in gettin' all het up an' sweaty. Mr. Pocket'll  wait for you. He ain't a-runnin' away before you can get yer breakfast. Now,  what you want, Bill, is something fresh in yer bill o' fare. So it's up to you  to go an' get it.""      <br><br>He cut a short pole at the water's edge and drew from one of his pockets a bit  of line and a draggled fly that had once been a royal coachman.    <br><br>""Mebbe they'll bite in the early morning,"" he muttered, as he made his first  cast into the pool. And a moment later he was gleefully crying: ""What'd I tell  you, eh? What'd I tell you?""      <br><br>He had no reel, nor any inclination to waste time, and by main strength, and  swiftly, he drew out of the water a flashing ten-inch trout. Three more,  caught in rapid succession, furnished his breakfast. When he came to the  stepping-stones on his way to his hillside, he was struck by a sudden thought,  and paused.    <br><br>""I'd just better take a hike down-stream a ways,"" he said. ""There's no tellin'  what cuss may be snoopin' around.""      <br><br>But he crossed over on the stones, and with a ""I really oughter take that  hike,"" the need of the precaution passed out of his mind and he fell to work.  .    <br><br>At nightfall he straightened up. The small of his back was stiff from stooping  toil, and as he put his hand behind him to soothe the protesting muscles, he  said:      <br><br>""Now what d'ye think of that, by damn? I clean forgot my dinner again! If I  don't watch out, I'll sure be degeneratin' into a two-meal-a-day crank.""    <br><br>""Pockets is the damnedest things I ever see for makin' a man absent-minded,""  he communed that night, as he crawled into his blankets. Nor did he forget to  call up the hillside, ""Good night, Mr. Pocket! Good night!""      <br><br>Rising with the sun, and snatching a hasty breakfast, he was early at work. A  fever seemed to be growing in him, nor did the increasing richness of the  test-pans allay this fever. There was a flush in his cheek other than that  made by the heat of the sun, and he was oblivious to fatigue and the passage  of time. When he filled a pan with dirt, he ran down the hill to wash it; nor  could he forbear running up the hill again, panting and stumbling profanely,  to refill the pan.    <br><br>He was now a hundred yards from the water, and the inverted ""V"" was assuming  definite proportions. The width of the pay-dirt steadily decreased, and the  man extended in his mind's eye the sides of the ""V"" to their meeting-place far  up the hill. This was his goal, the apex of the ""V,"" and he panned many times  to locate it.      <br><br>""Just about two yards above that manzanita bush an' a yard to the right,"" he  finally concluded.    <br><br>Then the temptation seized him. "" s plain as the nose on your face,"" he said,  as he abandoned his laborious cross-cutting and climbed to the indicated apex.  He filled a pan and carried it down the hill to wash. It contained no trace of  gold. He dug deep, and he dug shallow, filling and washing a dozen pans, and  was unrewarded even by the tiniest golden speck. He was enraged at having  yielded to the temptation, and cursed himself blasphemously and pridelessly.  Then he went down the hill and took up the cross-cutting.      <br><br>""Slow an' certain, Bill; slow an' certain,"" he crooned. ""Short-cuts to fortune  ain't in your line, an' it's about time you know it. Get wise, Bill; get wise.  Slow an' certain's the only hand you can play; so go to it, an' keep to it,  too.""    <br><br>As the cross-cuts decreased, showing that the sides of the ""V"" were  converging, the depth of the "" V "" increased. The gold-trace was dipping into  the hill. It was only at thirty inches beneath the surface that he could get  colors in his pan. The dirt he found at twenty-five inches from the surface,  and at thirty-five inches, yielded barren pans. At the base of the ""V,"" by the  water's edge, he had found the gold colors at the grass roots. The higher he  went up the hill, the deeper the gold dipped.      <br><br>To dig a hole three feet deep in order to get one test-pan was a task of no  mean magnitude; while between the man and the apex intervened an untold number  of such holes to be. ""An' there's no tellin' how much deeper it'll pitch,"" he  sighed, in a moment's pause, while his fingers soothed his aching back.    <br><br>Feverish with desire, with aching back and stiffening muscles, with pick and  shovel gouging and mauling the soft brown earth, the man toiled up the hill.  Before him was the smooth slope, spangled with flowers and made sweet with  their breath. Behind him was devastation. It looked like some terrible  eruption breaking out on the smooth skin of the hill. His slow progress was  like that of a slug, befouling beauty with a monstrous trail.      <br><br>Though the dipping gold-trace increased the man's work, he found consolation  in the increasing richness of the pans. Twenty cents, thirty cents, fifty  cents, sixty cents, were the values of the gold found in the pans, and at  nightfall he washed his banner pan, which gave him a dollar's worth of  gold-dust from a shovelful of dirt.    <br><br>""I'll just bet it's my luck to have some inquisitive cuss come buttin' in here  on my pasture,"" he mumbled sleepily that night as he pulled the blankets up to  his chin.      <br><br>Suddenly he sat upright. ""Bill!"" he called sharply. ""Now, listen to me, Bill;  d'ye hear! It's up to you, to-morrow mornin', to mosey round an' see what you  can see. Understand? Tomorrow morning, an' don't you forget it!""    <br><br>He yawned and glanced across at his side-hill. ""Good night, Mr. Pocket,"" he  called.      <br><br>In the morning he stole a march on the sun, for he had finished breakfast when  its first rays caught him, and he was climbing the wall of the canyon where it  crumbled away and gave footing. From the outlook at the top he found himself  in the midst of loneliness. As far as he could see, chain after chain of  mountains heaved themselves into his vision. To the east his eyes, leaping the  miles between range and range and between many ranges, brought up at last  against the white-peaked Sierras--the main crest, where the backbone of the  Western world reared itself against the sky. To the north and south he could  see more distinctly the cross-systems that broke through the main trend of the  sea of mountains. To the west the ranges fell away, one behind the other,  diminishing and fading into the gentle foothills that, in turn, descended into  the great valley which he could not see.    <br><br>And in all that mighty sweep of earth he saw no sign of man nor of the  handiwork of man--save only the torn bosom of the hillside at his feet. The  man looked long and carefully. Once, far down his own canyon, he thought he  saw in the air a faint hint of smoke. He looked again and decided that it was  the purple haze of the hills made dark by a convolution of the canyon wall at  its back.      <br><br>""Hey, you, Mr. Pocket!"" he called down into the canyon. ""Stand out from under!  I'm a-comin', Mr. Pocket! I'm a-comin'!""    <br><br>The heavy brogans on the man's feet made him appear clumsy-footed, but he  swung down from the giddy height as lightly and airily as a mountain goat. A  rock, turning under his foot on the edge of the precipice, did not disconcert  him. He seemed to know the precise time required for the turn to culminate in  disaster, and in the meantime he utilized the false footing itself for the  momentary earth-contact necessary to carry him on into safety. Where the earth  sloped so steeply that it was impossible to stand for a second upright, the  man did not hesitate. His foot pressed the impossible surface for but a  fraction of the fatal second and gave him the bound that carried him onward.  Again, where even the fraction of a second's footing was out of the question,  he would swing his body past by a moment's hand-grip on a jutting knob of  rock, a crevice, or a precariously rooted shrub. At last, with a wild leap and  yell, he exchanged the face of the wall for an earth-slide and finished the  descent in the midst of several tons of sliding earth and gravel.      <br><br>His first pan of the morning washed out over two dollars in coarse gold. It  was from the centre of the ""V."" To either side the diminution in the values of  the pans was swift. His lines of crosscutting holes were growing very short.  The converging sides of the inverted ""V"" were only a few yards apart. Their  meeting-point was only a few yards above him. But the pay-streak was dipping  deeper and deeper into the earth. By early afternoon he was sinking the  test-holes five feet before the pans could show the gold-trace.    <br><br>For that matter, the gold-trace had become something more than a trace; it was  a placer mine in itself, and the man resolved to come back after he had found  the pocket and work over the ground. But the increasing richness of the pans  began to worry him. By late afternoon the worth of the pans had grown to three  and four dollars. The man scratched his head perplexedly and looked a few feet  up the hill at the manzanita bush that marked approximately the apex of the  ""V."" He nodded his head and said oracularly:      <br><br>""It's one o' two things, Bill; one o' two things.  Either Mr. Pocket's spilled  himself all out an' down the hill, or else Mr. Pocket's that damned rich you  maybe won't be able to carry him all away with you. And that'd be hell,  wouldn't it, now?"" He chuckled at contemplation of so pleasant a dilemma.    <br><br>Nightfall found him by the edge of the stream his eyes wrestling with the  gathering darkness over the washing of a five-dollar pan.      <br><br>""Wisht I had an electric light to go on working."" he said.    <br><br>He found sleep difficult that night. Many times he composed himself and closed  his eyes for slumber to overtake him; but his blood pounded with too strong  desire, and as many times his eyes opened and he murmured wearily, ""Wisht it  was sun-up."" Sleep came to him in the end, but his eyes were open with the  first paling or the stars, and the gray of dawn caught him with breakfast  finished and climbing the hillside in the direction of the secret  abiding-place of Mr. Pocket.      <br><br>The first cross-cut the man made, there was space for only three holes, so  narrow had become the pay-streak and so close was he to the fountainhead of  the golden stream he had been following for four days.    <br><br>""Be ca'm, Bill; be calm,"" he admonished himself, as he broke ground for the  final hole where the sides of the ""V"" had at last come together in a point.      <br><br>""I've got the almighty cinch on you, Mr. Pocket, an' you can't lose me,"" he  said many times as he sank the hole deeper and deeper.    <br><br>Four feet, five feet, six feet, he dug his way down into the earth. The  digging grew harder. His pick grated on broken rock. He examined the rock.  ""Rotten quartz,"" was his conclusion as, with the shovel, he cleared the bottom  of the hole of loose dirt. He attacked the crumbling quartz with the pick,  bursting the disintegrating rock asunder with every stroke.      <br><br>He thrust his shovel into the loose mass. His eye caught a gleam of yellow. He  dropped the shovel and squatted suddenly on his heels. As a farmer rubs the  clinging earth from fresh-dug potatoes, so the man, a piece of rotten quartz  held in both hands, rubbed the dirt away.    <br><br>""Sufferin' Sardanopolis!"" he cried. ""Lumps an' chunks of it! Lumps an' chunks  of it!""      <br><br>It was only half rock he held in his hand. The other half was virgin gold. He  dropped it into his pan and examined another piece. Little yellow was to be  seen, but with his strong fingers he crumbled the rotten quartz away till both  hands were filled with glowing yellow. He rubbed the dirt away from fragment  after fragment, tossing them into the gold-pan. It was a treasure-hole. So  much had the quartz rotted away that there was less of it than there was of  gold. Now and again he found a piece to which no rock clung--a piece that was  all gold. A chunk, where the pick had laid open the heart of the gold,  glittered like a handful of yellow jewels, and he cocked his head at it and  slowly turned it around and over to observe the rich play of the light upon  it.    <br><br>""Talk about yer Too Much Gold diggin's!"" the man snorted contemptuously. ""Why,  this diggin' 'd make it look like thirty cents. This diggin' is All Gold. An'  right here an' now I name this yere canyon 'All Gold Canyon,' b' gosh!""      <br><br>Still squatting on his heels, he continued examining the fragments and tossing  them into the pan. Suddenly there came to him a premonition of danger. It  seemed a shadow had fallen upon him. But there was no shadow. His heart had  given a great jump up into his throat and was choking him. Then his blood  slowly chilled and he felt the sweat of his shirt cold against his flesh.    <br><br>He did not spring up nor look around. He did not move. He was considering the  nature of the premonition he had received, trying to locate the source of the  mysterious force that had warned him, striving to sense the imperative  presence of the unseen thing that threatened him. There is an aura of things  hostile, made manifest by messengers refined for the senses to know; and this  aura he felt, but knew not how he felt it. His was the feeling as when a cloud  passes over the sun. It seemed that between him and life had passed something  dark and smothering and menacing; a gloom, as it were, that swallowed up life  and made for death--his death.      <br><br>Every force of his being impelled him to spring up and confront the unseen  danger, but his soul dominated the panic, and he remained squatting on his  heels, in his hands a chunk of gold. He did not dare to look around, but he  knew by now that there was something behind him and above him. He made believe  to be interested in the gold in his hand. He examined it critically, turned it  over and over, and rubbed the dirt from it. And all the time he knew that  something behind him was looking at the gold over his shoulder.    <br><br>Still feigning interest in the chunk of gold in his hand, he listened intently  and he heard the breathing of the thing behind him. His eyes searched the  ground in front of him for a weapon, but they saw only the uprooted gold,  worthless to him now in his extremity. There was his pick, a handy weapon on  occasion; but this was not such an occasion. The man realized his predicament.  He was in a narrow hole that was seven feet deep. His head did not come to the  surface of the ground. He was in a trap.      <br><br>He remained squatting on his heels. He was quite cool and collected; but his  mind, considering every factor, showed him only his helplessness. He continued  rubbing the dirt from the quartz fragments and throwing the gold into the pan.  There was nothing else for him to do. Yet he knew that he would have to rise  up, sooner or later, and face the danger that breathed at his back.    <br><br>The minutes passed, and with the passage of each minute he knew that by so  much he was nearer the time when he must stand up, or else--and his wet shirt  went cold against his flesh again at the thought--or else he might receive  death as he stooped there over his treasure.      <br><br>Still he squatted on his heels, rubbing dirt from gold and debating in just  what manner he should rise up. He might rise up with a rush and claw his way  out of the hole to meet whatever threatened on the even footing above ground.  Or he might rise up slowly and carelessly, and feign casually to discover the  thing that breathed at his back. His instinct and every fighting fibre of his  body favored the mad, clawing rush to the surface. His intellect, and the  craft thereof, favored the slow and cautious meeting with the thing that  menaced and which he could not see. And while he debated, a loud, crashing  noise burst on his ear. At the same instant he received a stunning blow on the  left side of the back, and from the point of impact felt a rush of flame  through his flesh. He sprang up in the air, but halfway to his feet collapsed.  His body crumpled in like a leaf withered in sudden heat, and he came down,  his chest across his pan of gold, his face in the dirt and rock, his legs  tangled and twisted because of the restricted space at the bottom of the hole.  His legs twitched convulsively several times. His body was shaken as with a  mighty ague. There was a slow expansion of the lungs, accompanied by a deep  sigh. Then the air was slowly, very slowly, exhaled, and his body as slowly  flattened itself down into inertness.    <br><br>Above, revolver in hand, a man was peering down over the edge of the hole. He  peered for a long time at the prone and motionless body beneath him. After a  while the stranger sat down on the edge of the hole so that he could see into  it, and rested the revolver on his knee. Reaching his hand into a pocket, he  drew out a wisp of brown paper. Into this he dropped a few crumbs of tobacco.  The combination became a cigarette, brown and squat, with the ends turned in.  Not once did he take his eyes from the body at the bottom of the hole. He  lighted the cigarette and drew its smoke into his lungs with a caressing  intake of the breath. He smoked slowly. Once the cigarette went out and he  relighted it. And all the while he studied the body beneath him.      <br><br>In the end he tossed the cigarette stub away and rose to his feet. He moved to  the edge of the hole. Spanning it, a hand resting on each edge, and with the  revolver still in the right hand, he muscled his body down into the hole.  While his feet were yet a yard from the bottom he released his hands and  dropped down.    <br><br>At the instant his feet struck bottom he saw the pocket-miner's arm leap out,  and his own legs knew a swift, jerking grip that overthrew him. In the nature  of the jump his revolver-hand was above his head. Swiftly as the grip had  flashed about his legs, just as swiftly he brought the revolver down. He was  still in the air, his fall in process of completion, when he pulled the  trigger. The explosion was deafening in the confined space. The smoke filled  the hole so that he could see nothing. He struck the bottom on his back, and  like a cat's the pocket-miner's body was on top of him. Even as the miner's  body passed on top, the stranger crooked in his right arm to fire; and even in  that instant the miner, with a quick trust of elbow, struck his wrist. The  muzzle was thrown up and the bullet thudded into the dirt of the side of the  hole.      <br><br>The next instant the stranger felt the miner's hand grip his wrist. The  struggle was now for the revolver. each man strove to turn it against the  other's body. The smoke in the hole was clearing. The stranger, lying on his  back, was beginning to see dimly. But suddenly he was blinded by a handful of  dirt deliberately flung into his eyes by his antagonist. In that moment of  shock his grip on the revolver was broken. In the next moment he felt a  smashing darkness descend upon his brain, and in the midst of the darkness  even the darkness ceased.    <br><br>But the pocket-miner fired again and again, until the revolver was empty. Then  he tossed it from him and, breathing heavily, sat down on the dead man's legs.      <br><br>The miner was sobbing and struggling for breath. ""Measly skunk!"" he panted;  ""a-campin' on my trail an' lettin' me do the work, an' then shootin' me in the  back!""    <br><br>He was half crying from anger and exhaustion, He peered at the face of the  dead man. It was sprinkled with loose dirt and gravel, and it was difficult to  distinguish the features.      <br><br>""Never laid eyes on him before,"" the miner concluded his scrutiny. ""Just a  common an' ordinary thief, damn him! An' he shot me in the back! He shot me in  the back!""    <br><br>He opened his shirt and felt himself, front and back, on his left side.      <br><br>""Went clean through, and no harm done!"" he cried jubilantly. ""I'll bet he  aimed right all right, but he drew the gun over when he pulled the  trigger--the cuss! But I fixed 'm! Oh, I fixed 'm!""    <br><br>His fingers were investigating the bullet-hole in his side, and a shade of  regret passed over his face. ""It's goin' to be stiffer'n hell,"" he said. ""An'  it's up to me to get mended an' get out o' here.""      <br><br>He crawled out of the hole and went down the hill to his camp. Half an hour  later he returned, leading his pack-horse. His open shirt disclosed the rude  bandages with which he had dressed his wound. He was slow and awkward with his  left-hand movements, but that did not prevent his using the arm.    <br><br>The bight of the pack-rope under the dead man's shoulders enabled him to heave  the body out of the hole. Then he set to work gathering up his gold. He worked  steadily for several hours, pausing often to rest his stiffening shoulder and  to exclaim:      <br><br>""He shot me in the back, the measly skunk! He shot me in the back!""    <br><br>When his treasure was guise cleaned up and wrapped securely into a number of  blanket-covered parcels, he made an estimate of its value.      <br><br>""Four hundred pounds, or I'm a Hottentot,"" he concluded. ""Say two hundred in  quartz an' dirt--that leaves two hundred pounds of gold. Bill! Wake up! Two  hundred pounds of gold! Forty thousand dollars! An' it's yourn--all yourn!""    <br><br>He scratched his head delightedly and his fingers blundered into an unfamiliar  groove. They quested along it for several inches. It was a crease through his  scalp where the second bullet had ploughed.      <br><br>He walked angrily over to the dead man.    <br><br>""You would, would you?"" he bullied. ""You would, eh? Well, I fixed you good an'  plenty, an' I'll give you decent burial, too. That's more'n you'd have done  for me.""      <br><br>He dragged the body to the edge of the hole and toppled it in. It struck the  bottom with a dull crash, on its side, the face twisted up to the light. The  miner peered down at it.    <br><br>""An' you shot me in the back!"" he said accusingly.      <br><br>With pick and shovel he filled the hole. Then he loaded the gold on his horse.  It was too great a load for the animal, and when he had gained his camp he  transferred part of it to his saddle-horse. Even so, he was compelled to  abandon a portion of his outfit--pick and shovel and gold-pan, extra food and  cooking utensils, and divers odds and ends.    <br><br>The sun was at the zenith when the man forced the horses at the screen of  vines and creepers. To climb the huge boulders the animals were compelled to  uprear and struggle blindly through the tangled mass of vegetation. Once the  saddle-horse fell heavily and the man removed the pack to get the animal on  its feet. After it started on its way again the man thrust his head out from  among the leaves and peered up at the hillside.      <br><br>""The measly skunk!"" he said, and disappeared.    <br><br>There was a ripping and tearing of vines and boughs. The trees surged back and  forth, marking the passage of the animals through the midst of them. There was  a clashing of steel-shod hoofs on stone, and now and again an oath or a sharp  cry of command. Then the voice of the man was raised in song:--      <br><br>""Tu'n around an' tu'n yo' face<br>  Untoe them sweet hills of grace<br>  (D' pow'rs of sin yo' am scornin'!).<br>  Look about an, look aroun',<br>  Fling yo' sin-pack on d' groun'<br>  (Yo' will meet wid d' Lord in d' mornin'!).""    <br><br>The song grew faint and fainter, and through the silence crept back the spirit  of the place. The stream once more drowsed and whispered; the hum of the  mountain bees rose sleepily. Down through the perfume-weighted air fluttered  the snowy fluffs of the cottonwoods. The butterflies drifted in and out among  the trees, and over all blazed the quiet sunshine. Only remained the  hoof-marks in the meadow and the torn hillside to mark the boisterous trail of  the life that had broken the peace of the place and passed on.                             <br><br>"
27,Aloha Oe,"Never are there such departures as from the dock at Honolulu.  The   great transport lay with steam up, ready to pull out.  A thousand   persons were on her decks; five thousand stood on the wharf.  Up and   down the long gangway passed native princes and princesses, sugar   kings and the high officials of the Territory.  Beyond, in long   lines, kept in order by the native police, were the carriages and   motor-cars of the Honolulu aristocracy.  On the wharf the Royal   Hawaiian Band played ""Aloha Oe,"" and when it finished, a stringed   orchestra of native musicians on board the transport took up the   same sobbing strains, the native woman singer's voice rising   birdlike above the instruments and the hubbub of departure.  It was   a silver reed, sounding its clear, unmistakable note in the great   diapason of farewell.      <br><br>Forward, on the lower deck, the rail was lined six deep with khaki-  clad young boys, whose bronzed faces told of three years'   campaigning under the sun.  But the farewell was not for them.  Nor   was it for the white-clad captain on the lofty bridge, remote as the   stars, gazing down upon the tumult beneath him.  Nor was the   farewell for the young officers farther aft, returning from the   Philippines, nor for the white-faced, climate-ravaged women by their   sides.  Just aft the gangway, on the promenade deck, stood a score   of United States Senators with their wives and daughters--the   Senatorial junketing party that for a month had been dined and   wined, surfeited with statistics and dragged up volcanic hill and   down lava dale to behold the glories and resources of Hawaii.  It   was for the junketing party that the transport had called in at   Honolulu, and it was to the junketing party that Honolulu was saying   good-bye.    <br><br>The Senators were garlanded and bedecked with flowers.  Senator   Jeremy Sambrooke's stout neck and portly bosom were burdened with a   dozen wreaths.  Out of this mass of bloom and blossom projected his   head and the greater portion of his freshly sunburned and perspiring   face.  He thought the flowers an abomination, and as he looked out   over the multitude on the wharf it was with a statistical eye that   saw none of the beauty, but that peered into the labour power, the   factories, the railroads, and the plantations that lay back of the   multitude and which the multitude expressed.  He saw resources and   thought development, and he was too busy with dreams of material   achievement and empire to notice his daughter at his side, talking   with a young fellow in a natty summer suit and straw hat, whose   eager eyes seemed only for her and never left her face.  Had Senator   Jeremy had eyes for his daughter, he would have seen that, in place   of the young girl of fifteen he had brought to Hawaii a short month   before, he was now taking away with him a woman.      <br><br>Hawaii has a ripening climate, and Dorothy Sambrooke had been   exposed to it under exceptionally ripening circumstances.  Slender,   pale, with blue eyes a trifle tired from poring over the pages of   books and trying to muddle into an understanding of life--such she   had been the month before.  But now the eyes were warm instead of   tired, the cheeks were touched with the sun, and the body gave the   first hint and promise of swelling lines.  During that month she had   left books alone, for she had found greater joy in reading from the   book of life.  She had ridden horses, climbed volcanoes, and learned   surf swimming.  The tropics had entered into her blood, and she was   aglow with the warmth and colour and sunshine.  And for a month she   had been in the company of a man--Stephen Knight, athlete, surf-  board rider, a bronzed god of the sea who bitted the crashing   breakers, leaped upon their backs, and rode them in to shore.    <br><br>Dorothy Sambrooke was unaware of the change.  Her consciousness was   still that of a young girl, and she was surprised and troubled by   Steve's conduct in this hour of saying good-bye.  She had looked   upon him as her playfellow, and for the month he had been her   playfellow; but now he was not parting like a playfellow.  He talked   excitedly and disconnectedly, or was silent, by fits and starts.    Sometimes he did not hear what she was saying, or if he did, failed   to respond in his wonted manner.  She was perturbed by the way he   looked at her.  She had not known before that he had such blazing   eyes.  There was something in his eyes that was terrifying.  She   could not face it, and her own eyes continually drooped before it.    Yet there was something alluring about it, as well, and she   continually returned to catch a glimpse of that blazing, imperious,   yearning something that she had never seen in human eyes before.    And she was herself strangely bewildered and excited.      <br><br>The transport's huge whistle blew a deafening blast, and the flower-  crowned multitude surged closer to the side of the dock.  Dorothy   Sambrooke's fingers were pressed to her ears; and as she made a moue   of distaste at the outrage of sound, she noticed again the   imperious, yearning blaze in Steve's eyes.  He was not looking at   her, but at her ears, delicately pink and transparent in the   slanting rays of the afternoon sun.  Curious and fascinated, she   gazed at that strange something in his eyes until he saw that he had   been caught.  She saw his cheeks flush darkly and heard him utter   inarticulately.  He was embarrassed, and she was aware of   embarrassment herself.  Stewards were going about nervously begging   shore-going persons to be gone.  Steve put out his hand.  When she   felt the grip of the fingers that had gripped hers a thousand times   on surf-boards and lava slopes, she heard the words of the song with   a new understanding as they sobbed in the Hawaiian woman's silver   throat:    <br><br>""Ka halia ko aloha kai hiki mai,<br>  Ke hone ae nei i ku'u manawa,<br>  O oe no kan aloha<br>  A loko e hana nei.""      <br><br>Steve had taught her air and words and meaning--so she had thought,   till this instant; and in this instant of the last finger clasp and   warm contact of palms she divined for the first time the real   meaning of the song.  She scarcely saw him go, nor could she note   him on the crowded gangway, for she was deep in a memory maze,   living over the four weeks just past, rereading events in the light   of revelation.    <br><br>When the Senatorial party had landed, Steve had been one of the   committee of entertainment.  It was he who had given them their   first exhibition of surf riding, out at Waikiki Beach, paddling his   narrow board seaward until he became a disappearing speck, and then,   suddenly reappearing, rising like a sea-god from out of the welter   of spume and churning white--rising swiftly higher and higher,   shoulders and chest and loins and limbs, until he stood poised on   the smoking crest of a mighty, mile-long billow, his feet buried in   the flying foam, hurling beach-ward with the speed of an express   train and stepping calmly ashore at their astounded feet.  That had   been her first glimpse of Steve.  He had been the youngest man on   the committee, a youth, himself, of twenty.  He had not entertained   by speechmaking, nor had he shone decoratively at receptions.  It   was in the breakers at Waikiki, in the wild cattle drive on Manna   Kea, and in the breaking yard of the Haleakala Ranch that he had   performed his share of the entertaining.      <br><br>She had not cared for the interminable statistics and eternal   speechmaking of the other members of the committee.  Neither had   Steve.  And it was with Steve that she had stolen away from the   open-air feast at Hamakua, and from Abe Louisson, the coffee   planter, who had talked coffee, coffee, nothing but coffee, for two   mortal hours.  It was then, as they rode among the tree ferns, that   Steve had taught her the words of ""Aloha Oe,"" the song that had been   sung to the visiting Senators at every village, ranch, and   plantation departure.    <br><br>Steve and she had been much together from the first.  He had been   her playfellow.  She had taken possession of him while her father   had been occupied in taking possession of the statistics of the   island territory.  She was too gentle to tyrannize over her   playfellow, yet she had ruled him abjectly, except when in canoe, or   on horse or surf-board, at which times he had taken charge and she   had rendered obedience.  And now, with this last singing of the   song, as the lines were cast off and the big transport began backing   slowly out from the dock, she knew that Steve was something more to   her than playfellow.      <br><br>Five thousand voices were singing ""Aloha Oe,""--""MY LOVE BE WITH YOU   TILL WE MEET AGAIN,""--and in that first moment of known love she   realized that she and Steve were being torn apart.  When would they   ever meet again?  He had taught her those words himself.  She   remembered listening as he sang them over and over under the hau   tree at Waikiki.  Had it been prophecy?  And she had admired his   singing, had told him that he sang with such expression.  She   laughed aloud, hysterically, at the recollection.  With such   expression!--when he had been pouring his heart out in his voice.    She knew now, and it was too late.  Why had he not spoken?  Then she   realized that girls of her age did not marry.  But girls of her age   did marry--in Hawaii--was her instant thought.  Hawaii had ripened   her--Hawaii, where flesh is golden and where all women are ripe and   sun-kissed.    <br><br>Vainly she scanned the packed multitude on the dock.  What had   become of him?  She felt she could pay any price for one more   glimpse of him, and she almost hoped that some mortal sickness would   strike the lonely captain on the bridge and delay departure.  For   the first time in her life she looked at her father with a   calculating eye, and as she did she noted with newborn fear the   lines of will and determination.  It would be terrible to oppose   him.  And what chance would she have in such a struggle?  But why   had Steve not spoken?  Now it was too late.  Why had he not spoken   under the hau tree at Waikiki?      <br><br>And then, with a great sinking of the heart, it came to her that she   knew why.  What was it she had heard one day?  Oh, yes, it was at   Mrs. Stanton's tea, that afternoon when the ladies of the   ""Missionary Crowd"" had entertained the ladies of the Senatorial   party.  It was Mrs. Hodgkins, the tall blonde woman, who had asked   the question.  The scene came back to her vividly--the broad lanai,   the tropic flowers, the noiseless Asiatic attendants, the hum of the   voices of the many women and the question Mrs. Hodgkins had asked in   the group next to her.  Mrs. Hodgkins had been away on the mainland   for years, and was evidently inquiring after old island friends of   her maiden days.  ""What has become of Susie Maydwell?"" was the   question she had asked.  ""Oh, we never see her any more; she married   Willie Kupele,"" another island woman answered.  And Senator   Behrend's wife laughed and wanted to know why matrimony had affected   Susie Maydwell's friendships.    <br><br>""Hapa-haole,"" was the answer; ""he was a half-caste, you know, and we   of the Islands have to think about our children.""      <br><br>Dorothy turned to her father, resolved to put it to the test.    <br><br>""Papa, if Steve ever comes to the United States, mayn't he come and   see us some time?""      <br><br>""Who?  Steve?""    <br><br>""Yes, Stephen Knight--you know him.  You said good-bye to him not   five minutes ago.  Mayn't he, if he happens to be in the United   States some time, come and see us?""      <br><br>""Certainly not,"" Jeremy Sambrooke answered shortly.  ""Stephen Knight   is a hapa-haole and you know what that means.""    <br><br>""Oh,"" Dorothy said faintly, while she felt a numb despair creep into   her heart.      <br><br>Steve was not a hapa-haole--she knew that; but she did not know that   a quarter-strain of tropic sunshine streamed in his veins, and she   knew that that was sufficient to put him outside the marriage pale.    It was a strange world.  There was the Honourable A. S. Cleghorn,   who had married a dusky princess of the Kamehameha blood, yet men   considered it an honour to know him, and the most exclusive women of   the ultra-exclusive ""Missionary Crowd"" were to be seen at his   afternoon teas.  And there was Steve.  No one had disapproved of his   teaching her to ride a surf-board, nor of his leading her by the   hand through the perilous places of the crater of Kilauea.  He could   have dinner with her and her father, dance with her, and be a member   of the entertainment committee; but because there was tropic   sunshine in his veins he could not marry her.    <br><br>And he didn't show it.  One had to be told to know.  And he was so   good-looking.  The picture of him limned itself on her inner vision,   and before she was aware she was pleasuring in the memory of the   grace of his magnificent body, of his splendid shoulders, of the   power in him that tossed her lightly on a horse, bore her safely   through the thundering breakers, or towed her at the end of an   alpenstock up the stern lava crest of the House of the Sun.  There   was something subtler and mysterious that she remembered, and that   she was even then just beginning to understand--the aura of the male   creature that is man, all man, masculine man.  She came to herself   with a shock of shame at the thoughts she had been thinking.  Her   cheeks were dyed with the hot blood which quickly receded and left   them pale at the thought that she would never see him again.  The   stem of the transport was already out in the stream, and the   promenade deck was passing abreast of the end of the dock.      <br><br>""There's Steve now,"" her father said.  ""Wave good-bye to him,   Dorothy.""    <br><br>Steve was looking up at her with eager eyes, and he saw in her face   what he had not seen before.  By the rush of gladness into his own   face she knew that he knew.  The air was throbbing with the song -      <br><br>My love to you.<br>  My love be with you till we meet again.    <br><br>There was no need for speech to tell their story.  About her,   passengers were flinging their garlands to their friends on the   dock.  Steve held up his hands and his eyes pleaded.  She slipped   her own garland over her head, but it had become entangled in the   string of Oriental pearls that Mervin, an elderly sugar king, had   placed around her neck when he drove her and her father down to the   steamer.      <br><br>She fought with the pearls that clung to the flowers.  The transport   was moving steadily on.  Steve was already beneath her.  This was   the moment.  The next moment and he would be past.  She sobbed, and   Jeremy Sambrooke glanced at her inquiringly.    <br><br>""Dorothy!"" he cried sharply.      <br><br>She deliberately snapped the string, and, amid a shower of pearls,   the flowers fell to the waiting lover.  She gazed at him until the   tears blinded her and she buried her face on the shoulder of Jeremy   Sambrooke, who forgot his beloved statistics in wonderment at girl   babies that insisted on growing up.  The crowd sang on, the song   growing fainter in the distance, but still melting with the sensuous   love-languor of Hawaii, the words biting into her heart like acid   because of their untruth.    <br><br>Aloha oe, Aloha oe, e ke onaona no ho ika lipo,<br>  A fond embrace, ahoi ae au, until we meet again.                             <br><br>"
28,A Nose for the King,"In the morning calm of Korea, when its peace and tranquillity truly merited  its ancient name, ""Cho-sen,"" there lived a politician by name Yi Chin Ho.  He was a man of parts, and--who shall say?--perhaps in no wise worse than  politicians the world over.  But, unlike his brethren in other lands, Yi  Chin Ho was in jail.  Not that he had inadvertently diverted to himself  public moneys, but that he had inadvertently diverted too much.  Excess is  to be deplored in all things, even in grafting, and Yi Chin Ho's excess had  brought him to most deplorable straits.<br><br>    Ten thousand strings of cash he owed the Government, and he lay in prison  under sentence of death.  There was one advantage to the situation--he had  plenty of time in which to think.  And he thought well.  Then called he the  jailer to him.<br><br>    ""Most worthy man, you see before you one most wretched,"" he began.  ""Yet  all will be well with me if you will but let me go free for one short hour  this night.  And all will be well with you, for I shall see to your  advancement through the years, and you shall come at length to the  directorship of all the prisons of Cho-sen.""<br><br>    ""How now?"" demanded the jailer.  ""What foolishness is this?  One short  hour, and you but waiting for your head to be chopped off!  And I, with an  aged and much-to-be-respected mother, not to say anything of a wife and  several children of tender years!  Out upon you for the scoundrel that you  are!""<br><br>    ""From the Sacred City to the ends of all the Eight Coasts there is no place  for me to hide,"" Yi Chin Ho made reply.  ""I am a man of wisdom, but of what  worth my wisdom here in prison?  Were I free, well I know I could seek out  and obtain the money wherewith to repay the Government.  I know of a nose  that will save me from all my difficulties.""<br><br>    ""A nose!"" cried the jailer.<br><br>    ""A nose,"" said Yi Chin Ho.  ""A remarkable nose, if I may say so, a most  remarkable nose.""<br><br>    The jailer threw up his hands despairingly.  ""Ah, what a wag you are, what  a wag,"" he laughed.  ""To think that that very admirable wit of yours must  go the way of the chopping-block!""<br><br>    And so saying, he turned and went away.  But in the end, being a man soft  of head and heart, when the night was well along he permitted Yi Chin Ho to  go.<br><br>    Straight he went to the Governor, catching him alone and arousing him from  his sleep.<br><br>    ""Yi Chin Ho, or I'm no Governor!"" cried the Governor.  ""What do you here  who should be in prison waiting on the chopping-block?""<br><br>    ""I pray Your Excellency to listen to me,"" said Yi Chin Ho, squatting on his  hams by the bedside and lighting his pipe from the fire-box.  ""A dead man  is without value.  It is true, I am as a dead man, without value to the  Government, to Your Excellency, or to myself.  But if, so to say, Your  Excellency were to give me my freedom--""<br><br>    ""Impossible!"" cried the Governor.  ""Beside, you are condemned to death.""<br><br>    ""Your Excellency well knows that if I can repay the ten thousand strings of  cash, the Government will pardon me,"" Yi Chin Ho went on.  ""So, as I say,  if Your Excellency were to give me my freedom for a few days, being a man  of understanding, I should then repay the Government and be in position to  be of service to Your Excellency.  I should be in position to be of very  great service to Your Excellency.""<br><br>    ""Have you a plan whereby you hope to obtain this money?"" asked the  Governor.<br><br>    ""I have,"" said Yi Chin Ho.<br><br>    ""Then come with it to me to-morrow night; I would now sleep,"" said the  Governor, taking up his snore where it had been interrupted.<br><br>    On the following night, having again obtained leave of absence from the  jailer, Yi Chin Ho presented himself at the Governor's bedside.<br><br>    ""Is it you, Yi Chin Ho?"" asked the Governor.  ""And have you the plan?""<br><br>    ""It is I, Your Excellency,"" answered Yi Chin Ho, ""and the plan is here.""<br><br>    ""Speak,"" commanded the Governor.<br><br>    ""The plan is here,"" repeated Yi Chin Ho, ""here in my hand.""<br><br>    The Governor sat up and opened his eyes.  Yi Chin Ho proffered in his hand  a sheet of paper.  The Governor held it to the light.<br><br>    ""Nothing but a nose,"" said he.<br><br>    ""A bit pinched, so, and so, Your Excellency,"" said Yi Chin Ho.<br><br>    ""Yes, a bit pinched here and there, as you say,"" said the Governor.<br><br>    ""Withal it is an exceeding corpulent nose, thus, and so, all in one place,  at the end,"" proceeded Yi Chin Ho.  ""Your Excellency would seek far and  wide and many a day for that nose and find it not!""<br><br>    ""An unusual nose,"" admitted the Governor.<br><br>    ""There is a wart upon it,"" said Yi Chin Ho.<br><br>    ""A most unusual nose,"" said the Governor.  ""Never have I seen the like.  But what do you with this nose, Yi Chin Ho?""<br><br>    ""I seek it whereby to repay the money to the Government,"" said Yi Chin Ho.  ""I seek it to be of service to Your Excellency, and I seek it to save my  own worthless head.  Further, I seek Your Excellency's seal upon this  picture of the nose.""<br><br>    And the Governor laughed and affixed the seal of State, and Yi Chin Ho  departed.  For a month and a day he travelled the King's Road which leads  to the shore of the Eastern Sea; and there, one night, at the gate of the  largest mansion of a wealthy city he knocked loudly for admittance.<br><br>    ""None other than the master of the house will I see,"" said he fiercely to  the frightened servants.  ""I travel upon the King's business.""<br><br>    Straightway was he led to an inner room, where the master of the house was  roused from his sleep and brought blinking before him.<br><br>    ""You are Pak Chung Chang, head man of this city,"" said Yi Chin Ho in tones  that were all-accusing.  ""I am upon the King's business.""<br><br>    Pak Chung Chang trembled.  Well he knew the King's business was ever a  terrible business.  His knees smote together, and he near fell to the  floor.<br><br>    ""The hour is late,"" he quavered.  ""Were it not well to--""<br><br>    ""The King's business never waits!"" thundered Yi Chin Ho.  ""Come apart with  me, and swiftly.  I have an affair of moment to discuss with you.<br><br>    ""It is the King's affair,"" he added with even greater fierceness; so that  Pak Chung Chang's silver pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers and  clattered on the floor.<br><br>    ""Know then,"" said Yi Chin Ho, when they had gone apart, ""that the King is  troubled with an affliction, a very terrible affliction.  In that he failed  to cure, the Court physician has had nothing else than his head chopped  off.  From all the Eight Provinces have the physicians come to wait upon  the King.  Wise consultation have they held, and they have decided that for  a remedy for the King's affliction nothing else is required than a nose, a  certain kind of nose, a very peculiar certain kind of nose.<br><br>    ""Then by none other was I summoned than His Excellency the Prime Minister  himself.  He put a paper into my hand.  Upon this paper was the very  peculiar kind of nose drawn by the physicians of the Eight Provinces, with  the seal of State upon it.<br><br>    ""'Go,' said His Excellency the Prime Minister.  'Seek out this nose, for  the King's affliction is sore.  And wheresoever you find this nose upon the  face of a man, strike it off forthright and bring it in all haste to the  Court, for the King must be cured.  Go, and come not back until your search  is rewarded.'<br><br>    ""And so I departed upon my quest,"" said Yi Chin Ho.  ""I have sought out the  remotest corners of the kingdom; I have travelled the Eight Highways,  searched the Eight Provinces, and sailed the seas of the Eight Coasts.  And  here I am.""<br><br>    With a great flourish he drew a paper from his girdle, unrolled it with  many snappings and cracklings, and thrust it before the face of Pak Chung  Chang.  Upon the paper was the picture of the nose.<br><br>    Pak Chung Chang stared upon it with bulging eyes.<br><br>    ""Never have I beheld such a nose,"" he began.<br><br>    ""There is a wart upon it,"" said Yi Chin Ho.<br><br>    ""Never have I beheld--"" Pak Chung Chang began again.<br><br>    ""Bring your father before me,"" Yi Chin Ho interrupted sternly.<br><br>    ""My ancient and very-much-to-be-respected ancestor sleeps,"" said Pak Chung  Chang.<br><br>    ""Why dissemble?"" demanded Yi Chin Ho.  ""You know it is your father's nose.  Bring him before me that I may strike it off and be gone.  Hurry, lest I  make bad report of you.""<br><br>    ""Mercy!"" cried Pak Chung Chang, falling on his knees.  ""It is impossible!  It is impossible!  You cannot strike off my father's nose.  He cannot go  down without his nose to the grave.  He will become a laughter and a  byword, and all my days and nights will be filled with woe.  O reflect!  Report that you have seen no such nose in your travels.  You, too, have a  father.""<br><br>    Pak Chung Chang clasped Yi Chin Ho's knees and fell to weeping on his  sandals.<br><br>    ""My heart softens strangely at your tears,"" said Yi Chin Ho.  ""I, too, know  filial piety and regard.  But--""  He hesitated, then added, as though  thinking aloud, ""It is as much as my head is worth.""<br><br>    ""How much is your head worth?"" asked Pak Chung Chang in a thin, small  voice.<br><br>    ""A not remarkable head,"" said Yi Chin Ho.  ""An absurdly unremarkable head;  but, such is my great foolishness, I value it at nothing less than one  hundred thousand strings of cash.""<br><br>    ""So be it,"" said Pak Chung Chang, rising to his feet.<br><br>    ""I shall need horses to carry the treasure,"" said Yi Chin Ho, ""and men to  guard it well as I journey through the mountains.  There are robbers abroad  in the land.""<br><br>    ""There are robbers abroad in the land,"" said Pak Chung Chang, sadly.  ""But  it shall be as you wish, so long as my ancient and very-much-to-be-  respected ancestor's nose abide in its appointed place.""<br><br>    ""Say nothing to any man of this occurrence,"" said Yi Chin Ho, ""else will  other and more loyal servants than I be sent to strike off your father's  nose.""<br><br>    And so Yi Chin Ho departed on his way through the mountains, blithe of  heart and gay of song as he listened to the jingling bells of his treasure-  laden ponies.<br><br>    There is little more to tell.  Yi Chin Ho prospered through the years.  By  his efforts the jailer attained at length to the directorship of all the  prisons of Cho-sen; the Governor ultimately betook himself to the Sacred  City to be Prime Minister to the King, while Yi Chin Ho became the King's  boon companion and sat at table with him to the end of a round, fat life.  But Pak Chung Chang fell into a melancholy, and ever after he shook his  head sadly, with tears in his eyes, whenever he regarded the expensive nose  of his ancient and very-much-to-be-respected ancestor.  						                                      <br><br>"
29,A Piece of Steak,"With the last morsel of bread Tom King wiped his plate clean of the last particle of flour gravy and chewed the resulting mouthful in a slow and meditative way. When he arose from the table, he was oppressed by the feeling that he was distinctly hungry. Yet he alone had eaten. The two children in the other room had been sent early to bed in order that in sleep they might forget they had gone supperless. His wife had touched nothing, and had sat silently and watched him with solicitous eyes. She was a thin, worn woman of the working-class, though signs of an earlier prettiness were not wanting in her face. The flour for the gravy she had borrowed from the neighbour across the hall The last two ha'pennies had gone to buy the bread.  <br><br>  He sat down by the window on a rickety chair that protested under his weight, and quite mechanically he put his pipe in his mouth and dipped into the side pocket of his coat. The absence of any tobacco made him aware of his action, and, with a scowl for his forgetfulness, he put the pipe away. His movements were slow, almost hulking, as though he were burdened by the heavy weight of his muscles. He was a solid-bodied, stolid-looking man, and his appearance did not suffer from being overprepossessing. His rough clothes were old and slouchy. The uppers of his shoes were too weak to carry the heavy re-soling that was itself of no recent date. And his cotton shirt, a cheap, two shilling affair, showed a frayed collar and ineradicable paint stains.  <br><br>  But it was Tom King's face that advertised him unmistakably for what he was. It was the face of a typical prize-fighter; of one who had put in long years of service in the squared ring and, by that means, developed and emphasized all the marks of the fighting beast. It was distinctly a lowering countenance, and, that no feature of it might escape notice, it was clean-shaven. The lips were shapeless and constituted a mouth harsh to excess, that was like a gash in his face. The jaw was aggressive, brutal, heavy. The eyes, slow of movement and heavy-lidded, were almost expressionless under the shaggy, indrawn brows. Sheer animal that he was, the eyes were the most animal-like feature about him. They were sleepy, lion-like--the eyes of a fighting animal. The forehead slanted quickly back to the hair, which, clipped close, showed every bump of a villainous- looking head. A nose twice broken and moulded variously by countless blows, and a cauliflower ear, permanently swollen and distorted to twice its size, completed his adornment, while the beard, fresh-shaven as it was, sprouted in the skin and gave the face a blue-black stain.  <br><br>  Altogether, it was the face of a man to be afraid of in a dark alley or lonely place. And yet Tom King was not a criminal, nor had he ever done anything criminal. Outside of brawls, common to his walk in life, he had harmed no one. Nor had he ever been known to pick a quarrel. He was a professional, and all the fighting brutishness of him was reserved for his professional appearances. Outside the ring he was slow-going, easy- natured, and, in his younger days, when money was flush, too open-handed for his own good. He bore no grudges and had few enemies. Fighting was a business with him. In the ring he struck to hurt, struck to maim, struck to destroy; but there was no animus in it. It was a plain business proposition. Audiences assembled and paid for the spectacle of men knocking each other out. The winner took the big end of the purse. When Tom King faced the Woolloomoolloo Gouger, twenty years before, he knew that the Gouger's jaw was only four months healed after having been broken in a Newcastle bout. And he had played for that jaw and broken it again in the ninth round, not because he bore the Gouger any ill-will, but because that was the surest way to put the Gouger out and win the big end of the purse. Nor had the Gouger borne him any ill-will for it. It was the game, and both knew the game and played it.  <br><br>  Tom King had never been a talker, and he sat by the window, morosely silent, staring at his hands. The veins stood out on the backs of the hands, large and swollen; and the knuckles, smashed and battered and malformed, testified to the use to which they had been put. He had never heard that a man's life was the life of his arteries, but well he knew the meaning of those big upstanding veins. His heart had pumped too much blood through them at top pressure. They no longer did the work. He had stretched the elasticity out of them, and with their distension had passed his endurance. He tired easily now. No longer could he do a fast twenty rounds, hammer and tongs, fight, fight, fight, from gong to gong, with fierce rally on top of fierce rally, beaten to the ropes and in turn beating his opponent to the ropes, and rallying fiercest and fastest of all in that last, twentieth round, with the house on its feet and yelling, himself rushing, striking, ducking, raining showers of blows upon showers of blows and receiving showers of blows in return, and all the time the heart faithfully pumping the surging blood through the adequate veins. The veins, swollen at the time, had always shrunk down again, though each time, imperceptibly at first, not quite--remaining just a trifle larger than before. He stared at them and at his battered knuckles, and, for the moment, caught a vision of the youthful excellence of those hands before the first knuckle had been smashed on the head of Benny Jones, otherwise known as the Welsh Terror.  <br><br>  The impression of his hunger came back on him.  <br><br>  ""Blimey, but couldn't I go a piece of steak!"" he muttered aloud, clenching his huge fists and spitting out a smothered oath.  <br><br>  ""I tried both Burke's an' Sawley's,"" his wife said half apologetically.  <br><br>  ""An' they wouldn't?"" he demanded.  <br><br>  ""Not a ha'penny. Burke said--"" She faltered.  <br><br>  ""G'wan! Wot'd he say?""  <br><br>  ""As how 'e was thinkin' Sandel ud do ye to-night, an' as how yer score was comfortable big as it was.""  <br><br>  Tom King grunted, but did not reply. He was busy thinking of the bull terrier he had kept in his younger days to which he had fed steaks without end. Burke would have given him credit for a thousand steaks--then. But times had changed. Tom King was getting old; and old men, fighting before second-rate clubs, couldn't expect to run bills of any size with the tradesmen.  <br><br>  He had got up in the morning with a longing for a piece of steak, and the longing had not abated. He had not had a fair training for this fight. It was a drought year in Australia, times were hard, and even the most irregular work was difficult to find. He had had no sparring partner, and his food had not been of the best nor always sufficient. He had done a few days' navvy work when he could get it, and he had run around the Domain in the early mornings to get his legs in shape. But it was hard, training without a partner and with a wife and two kiddies that must be fed. Credit with the tradesmen had undergone very slight expansion when he was matched with Sandel. The secretary of the Gayety Club had advanced him three pounds--the loser's end of the purse--and beyond that had refused to go. Now and again he had managed to borrow a few shillings from old pals, who would have lent more only that it was a drought year and they were hard put themselves. No--and there was no use in disguising the fact--his training had not been satisfactory. He should have had better food and no worries. Besides, when a man is forty, it is harder to get into condition than when he is twenty.  <br><br>  ""What time is it, Lizzie?"" he asked.  <br><br>  His wife went across the hall to inquire, and came back.  <br><br>  ""Quarter before eight.""  <br><br>  ""They'll be startin' the first bout in a few minutes,"" he said. ""Only a try-out. Then there's a four-round spar 'tween Dealer Wells an' Gridley, an' a ten-round go 'tween Starlight an' some sailor bloke. I don't come on for over an hour.""  <br><br>  At the end of another silent ten minutes, he rose to his feet.  <br><br>  ""Truth is, Lizzie, I ain't had proper trainin'.""  <br><br>  He reached for his hat and started for the door. He did not offer to kiss her--he never did on going out--but on this night she dared to kiss him, throwing her arms around him and compelling him to bend down to her face. She looked quite small against the massive bulk of the man.  <br><br>  ""Good luck, Tom,"" she said. ""You gotter do 'im.""  <br><br>  ""Ay, I gotter do 'im,"" he repeated. ""That's all there is to it. I jus' gotter do 'im.""  <br><br>  He laughed with an attempt at heartiness, while she pressed more closely against him. Across her shoulders he looked around the bare room. It was all he had in the world, with the rent overdue, and her and the kiddies. And he was leaving it to go out into the night to get meat for his mate and cubs--not like a modern working-man going to his machine grind, but in the old, primitive, royal, animal way, by fighting for it.  <br><br>  ""I gotter do 'im,"" he repeated, this time a hint of desperation in his voice. ""If it's a win, it's thirty quid--an' I can pay all that's owin', with a lump o' money left over. If it's a lose, I get naught--not even a penny for me to ride home on the tram. The secretary's give all that's comin' from a loser's end. Good-bye, old woman. I'll come straight home if it's a win.""  <br><br>  ""An' I'll be waitin' up,"" she called to him along the hall.  <br><br>  It was full two miles to the Gayety, and as he walked along he remembered how in his palmy days--he had once been the heavyweight champion of New South Wales--he would have ridden in a cab to the fight, and how, most likely, some heavy backer would have paid for the cab and ridden with him. There were Tommy Burns and that Yankee nigger, Jack Johnson--they rode about in motor-cars. And he walked! And, as any man knew, a hard two miles was not the best preliminary to a fight. He was an old un, and the world did not wag well with old uns. He was good for nothing now except navvy work, and his broken nose and swollen ear were against him even in that. He found himself wishing that he had learned a trade. It would have been better in the long run. But no one had told him, and he knew, deep down in his heart, that he would not have listened if they had. It had been so easy. Big money--sharp, glorious fights--periods of rest and loafing in between--a following of eager flatterers, the slaps on the back, the shakes of the hand, the toffs glad to buy him a drink for the privilege of five minutes' talk--and the glory of it, the yelling houses, the whirlwind finish, the referee's ""King wins!"" and his name in the sporting columns next day.  <br><br>  Those had been times! But he realized now, in his slow, ruminating way, that it was the old uns he had been putting away. He was Youth, rising; and they were Age, sinking. No wonder it had been easy--they with their swollen veins and battered knuckles and weary in the bones of them from the long battles they had already fought. He remembered the time he put out old Stowsher Bill, at Rush-Cutters Bay, in the eighteenth round, and how old Bill had cried afterward in the dressing-room like a baby. Perhaps old Bill's rent had been overdue. Perhaps he'd had at home a missus an' a couple of kiddies. And perhaps Bill, that very day of the fight, had had a hungering for a piece of steak. Bill had fought game and taken incredible punishment. He could see now, after he had gone through the mill himself, that Stowsher Bill had fought for a bigger stake, that night twenty years ago, than had young Tom King, who had fought for glory and easy money. No wonder Stowsher Bill had cried afterward in the dressing-room.  <br><br>  Well, a man had only so many fights in him, to begin with. It was the iron law of the game. One man might have a hundred hard fights in him, another man only twenty; each, according to the make of him and the quality of his fibre, had a definite number, and, when he had fought them, he was done. Yes, he had had more fights in him than most of them, and he had had far more than his share of the hard, gruelling fights--the kind that worked the heart and lungs to bursting, that took the elastic out of the arteries and made hard knots of muscle out of Youth's sleek suppleness, that wore out nerve and stamina and made brain and bones weary from excess of effort and endurance overwrought. Yes, he had done better than all of them. There were none of his old fighting partners left. He was the last of the old guard. He had seen them all finished, and he had had a hand in finishing some of them.  <br><br>  They had tried him out against the old uns, and one after another he had put them away--laughing when, like old Stowsher Bill, they cried in the dressing-room. And now he was an old un, and they tried out the youngsters on him. There was that bloke, Sandel. He had come over from New Zealand with a record behind him. But nobody in Australia knew anything about him, so they put him up against old Tom King. If Sandel made a showing, he would be given better men to fight, with bigger purses to win; so it was to be depended upon that he would put up a fierce battle. He had everything to win by it--money and glory and career; and Tom King was the grizzled old chopping-block that guarded the highway to fame and fortune. And he had nothing to win except thirty quid, to pay to the landlord and the tradesmen. And, as Tom King thus ruminated, there came to his stolid vision the form of Youth, glorious Youth, rising exultant and invincible, supple of muscle and silken of skin, with heart and lungs that had never been tired and torn and that laughed at limitation of effort. Yes, Youth was the Nemesis. It destroyed the old uns and recked not that, in so doing, it destroyed itself. It enlarged its arteries and smashed its knuckles, and was in turn destroyed by Youth. For Youth was ever youthful. It was only Age that grew old.  <br><br>  At Castlereagh Street he turned to the left, and three blocks along came to the Gayety. A crowd of young larrikins hanging outside the door made respectful way for him, and he heard one say to another: ""That's 'im! That's Tom King!""  <br><br>  Inside, on the way to his dressing-room, he encountered the secretary, a keen-eyed, shrewd-faced young man, who shook his hand.  <br><br>  ""How are you feelin', Tom?"" he asked.  <br><br>  ""Fit as a fiddle,"" King answered, though he knew that he lied, and that if he had a quid, he would give it right there for a good piece of steak.  <br><br>  When he emerged from the dressing-room, his seconds behind him, and came down the aisle to the squared ring in the centre of the hall, a burst of greeting and applause went up from the waiting crowd. He acknowledged salutations right and left, though few of the faces did he know. Most of them were the faces of kiddies unborn when he was winning his first laurels in the squared ring. He leaped lightly to the raised platform and ducked through the ropes to his corner, where he sat down on a folding stool. Jack Ball, the referee, came over and shook his hand. Ball was a broken- down pugilist who for over ten years had not entered the ring as a principal. King was glad that he had him for referee. They were both old uns. If he should rough it with Sandel a bit beyond the rules, he knew Ball could be depended upon to pass it by.  <br><br>  Aspiring young heavyweights, one after another, were climbing into the ring and being presented to the audience by the referee. Also, he issued their challenges for them.  <br><br>  ""Young Pronto,"" Bill announced, ""from North Sydney, challenges the winner for fifty pounds side bet.""  <br><br>  The audience applauded, and applauded again as Sandel himself sprang through the ropes and sat down in his corner. Tom King looked across the ring at him curiously, for in a few minutes they would be locked together in merciless combat, each trying with all the force of him to knock the other into unconsciousness. But little could he see, for Sandel, like himself, had trousers and sweater on over his ring costume. His face was strongly handsome, crowned with a curly mop of yellow hair, while his thick, muscular neck hinted at bodily magnificence.  <br><br>  Young Pronto went to one corner and then the other, shaking hands with the principals and dropping down out of the ring. The challenges went on. Ever Youth climbed through the ropes--Youth unknown, but insatiable--crying out to mankind that with strength and skill it would match issues with the winner. A few years before, in his own heyday of invincibleness, Tom King would have been amused and bored by these preliminaries. But now he sat fascinated, unable to shake the vision of Youth from his eyes. Always were these youngsters rising up in the boxing game, springing through the ropes and shouting their defiance; and always were the old uns going down before them. They climbed to success over the bodies of the old uns. And ever they came, more and more youngsters--Youth unquenchable and irresistible-- and ever they put the old uns away, themselves becoming old uns and travelling the same downward path, while behind them, ever pressing on them, was Youth eternal--the new babies, grown lusty and dragging their elders down, with behind them more babies to the end of time--Youth that must have its will and that will never die.  <br><br>  King glanced over to the press box and nodded to Morgan, of the Sportsman, and Corbett, of the Referee. Then he held out his hands, while Sid Sullivan and Charley Bates, his seconds, slipped on his gloves and laced them tight, closely watched by one of Sandel's seconds, who first examined critically the tapes on King's knuckles. A second of his own was in Sandel's corner, performing a like office. Sandel's trousers were pulled off, and, as he stood up, his sweater was skinned off over his head. And Tom King, looking, saw Youth incarnate, deep-chested, heavy-thewed, with muscles that slipped and slid like live things under the white satin skin. The whole body was a-crawl with life, and Tom King knew that it was a life that had never oozed its freshness out through the aching pores during the long fights wherein Youth paid its toll and departed not quite so young as when it entered.  <br><br>  The two men advanced to meet each other, and, as the gong sounded and the seconds clattered out of the ring with the folding stools, they shook hands and instantly took their fighting attitudes. And instantly, like a mechanism of steel and springs balanced on a hair trigger, Sandel was in and out and in again, landing a left to the eyes, a right to the ribs, ducking a counter, dancing lightly away and dancing menacingly back again. He was swift and clever. It was a dazzling exhibition. The house yelled its approbation. But King was not dazzled. He had fought too many fights and too many youngsters. He knew the blows for what they were--too quick and too deft to be dangerous. Evidently Sandel was going to rush things from the start. It was to be expected. It was the way of Youth, expending its splendour and excellence in wild insurgence and furious onslaught, overwhelming opposition with its own unlimited glory of strength and desire.  <br><br>  Sandel was in and out, here, there, and everywhere, light-footed and eager- hearted, a living wonder of white flesh and stinging muscle that wove itself into a dazzling fabric of attack, slipping and leaping like a flying shuttle from action to action through a thousand actions, all of them centred upon the destruction of Tom King, who stood between him and fortune. And Tom King patiently endured. He knew his business, and he knew Youth now that Youth was no longer his. There was nothing to do till the other lost some of his steam, was his thought, and he grinned to himself as he deliberately ducked so as to receive a heavy blow on the top of his head. It was a wicked thing to do, yet eminently fair according to the rules of the boxing game. A man was supposed to take care of his own knuckles, and, if he insisted on hitting an opponent on the top of the head, he did so at his own peril. King could have ducked lower and let the blow whiz harmlessly past, but he remembered his own early fights and how he smashed his first knuckle on the head of the Welsh Terror. He was but playing the game. That duck had accounted for one of Sandel's knuckles. Not that Sandel would mind it now. He would go on, superbly regardless, hitting as hard as ever throughout the fight. But later on, when the long ring battles had begun to tell, he would regret that knuckle and look back and remember how he smashed it on Tom King's head.  <br><br>  The first round was all Sandel's, and he had the house yelling with the rapidity of his whirlwind rushes. He overwhelmed King with avalanches of punches, and King did nothing. He never struck once, contenting himself with covering up, blocking and ducking and clinching to avoid punishment. He occasionally feinted, shook his head when the weight of a punch landed, and moved stolidly about, never leaping or springing or wasting an ounce of strength. Sandel must foam the froth of Youth away before discreet Age could dare to retaliate. All King's movements were slow and methodical, and his heavy-lidded, slow-moving eyes gave him the appearance of being half asleep or dazed. Yet they were eyes that saw everything, that had been trained to see everything through all his twenty years and odd in the ring. They were eyes that did not blink or waver before an impending blow, but that coolly saw and measured distance.  <br><br>  Seated in his corner for the minute's rest at the end of the round, he lay back with outstretched legs, his arms resting on the right angle of the ropes, his chest and abdomen heaving frankly and deeply as he gulped down the air driven by the towels of his seconds. He listened with closed eyes to the voices of the house, ""Why don't yeh fight, Tom?"" many were crying. ""Yeh ain't afraid of 'im, are yeh?""  <br><br>  ""Muscle-bound,"" he heard a man on a front seat comment. ""He can't move quicker. Two to one on Sandel, in quids.""  <br><br>  The gong struck and the two men advanced from their corners. Sandel came forward fully three-quarters of the distance, eager to begin again; but King was content to advance the shorter distance. It was in line with his policy of economy. He had not been well trained, and he had not had enough to eat, and every step counted. Besides, he had already walked two miles to the ringside. It was a repetition of the first round, with Sandel attacking like a whirlwind and with the audience indignantly demanding why King did not fight. Beyond feinting and several slowly delivered and ineffectual blows he did nothing save block and stall and clinch. Sandel wanted to make the pace fast, while King, out of his wisdom, refused to accommodate him. He grinned with a certain wistful pathos in his ring- battered countenance, and went on cherishing his strength with the jealousy of which only Age is capable. Sandel was Youth, and he threw his strength away with the munificent abandon of Youth. To King belonged the ring generalship, the wisdom bred of long, aching fights. He watched with cool eyes and head, moving slowly and waiting for Sandel's froth to foam away. To the majority of the onlookers it seemed as though King was hopelessly outclassed, and they voiced their opinion in offers of three to one on Sandel. But there were wise ones, a few, who knew King of old time, and who covered what they considered easy money.  <br><br>  The third round began as usual, one-sided, with Sandel doing all the leading, and delivering all the punishment. A half-minute had passed when Sandel, over-confident, left an opening. King's eyes and right arm flashed in the same instant. It was his first real blow--a hook, with the twisted arch of the arm to make it rigid, and with all the weight of the half- pivoted body behind it. It was like a sleepy-seeming lion suddenly thrusting out a lightning paw. Sandel, caught on the side of the jaw, was felled like a bullock. The audience gasped and murmured awe-stricken applause. The man was not muscle-bound, after all, and he could drive a blow like a trip-hammer.  <br><br>  Sandel was shaken. He rolled over and attempted to rise, but the sharp yells from his seconds to take the count restrained him. He knelt on one knee, ready to rise, and waited, while the referee stood over him, counting the seconds loudly in his ear. At the ninth he rose in fighting attitude, and Tom King, facing him, knew regret that the blow had not been an inch nearer the point of the jaw. That would have been a knock-out, and he could have carried the thirty quid home to the missus and the kiddies.  <br><br>  The round continued to the end of its three minutes, Sandel for the first time respectful of his opponent and King slow of movement and sleepy-eyed as ever. As the round neared its close, King, warned of the fact by sight of the seconds crouching outside ready for the spring in through the ropes, worked the fight around to his own corner. And when the gong struck, he sat down immediately on the waiting stool, while Sandel had to walk all the way across the diagonal of the square to his own corner. It was a little thing, but it was the sum of little things that counted. Sandel was compelled to walk that many more steps, to give up that much energy, and to lose a part of the precious minute of rest. At the beginning of every round King loafed slowly out from his corner, forcing his opponent to advance the greater distance. The end of every round found the fight manoeuvred by King into his own corner so that he could immediately sit down.  <br><br>  Two more rounds went by, in which King was parsimonious of effort and Sandel prodigal. The latter's attempt to force a fast pace made King uncomfortable, for a fair percentage of the multitudinous blows showered upon him went home. Yet King persisted in his dogged slowness, despite the crying of the young hot-heads for him to go in and fight. Again, in the sixth round, Sandel was careless, again Tom King's fearful right flashed out to the jaw, and again Sandel took the nine seconds count.  <br><br>  By the seventh round Sandel's pink of condition was gone, and he settled down to what he knew was to be the hardest fight in his experience. Tom King was an old un, but a better old un than he had ever encountered--an old un who never lost his head, who was remarkably able at defence, whose blows had the impact of a knotted club, and who had a knockout in either hand. Nevertheless, Tom King dared not hit often. He never forgot his battered knuckles, and knew that every hit must count if the knuckles were to last out the fight. As he sat in his corner, glancing across at his opponent, the thought came to him that the sum of his wisdom and Sandel's youth would constitute a world's champion heavyweight. But that was the trouble. Sandel would never become a world champion. He lacked the wisdom, and the only way for him to get it was to buy it with Youth; and when wisdom was his, Youth would have been spent in buying it.  <br><br>  King took every advantage he knew. He never missed an opportunity to clinch, and in effecting most of the clinches his shoulder drove stiffly into the other's ribs. In the philosophy of the ring a shoulder was as good as a punch so far as damage was concerned, and a great deal better so far as concerned expenditure of effort. Also, in the clinches King rested his weight on his opponent, and was loath to let go. This compelled the interference of the referee, who tore them apart, always assisted by Sandel, who had not yet learned to rest. He could not refrain from using those glorious flying arms and writhing muscles of his, and when the other rushed into a clinch, striking shoulder against ribs, and with head resting under Sandel's left arm, Sandel almost invariably swung his right behind his own back and into the projecting face. It was a clever stroke, much admired by the audience, but it was not dangerous, and was, therefore, just that much wasted strength. But Sandel was tireless and unaware of limitations, and King grinned and doggedly endured.  <br><br>  Sandel developed a fierce right to the body, which made it appear that King was taking an enormous amount of punishment, and it was only the old ringsters who appreciated the deft touch of King's left glove to the other's biceps just before the impact of the blow. It was true, the blow landed each time; but each time it was robbed of its power by that touch on the biceps. In the ninth round, three times inside a minute, King's right hooked its twisted arch to the jaw; and three times Sandel's body, heavy as it was, was levelled to the mat. Each time he took the nine seconds allowed him and rose to his feet, shaken and jarred, but still strong. He had lost much of his speed, and he wasted less effort. He was fighting grimly; but he continued to draw upon his chief asset, which was Youth. King's chief asset was experience. As his vitality had dimmed and his vigour abated, he had replaced them with cunning, with wisdom born of the long fights and with a careful shepherding of strength. Not alone had he learned never to make a superfluous movement, but he had learned how to seduce an opponent into throwing his strength away. Again and again, by feint of foot and hand and body he continued to inveigle Sandel into leaping back, ducking, or countering. King rested, but he never permitted Sandel to rest. It was the strategy of Age.  <br><br>  Early in the tenth round King began stopping the other's rushes with straight lefts to the face, and Sandel, grown wary, responded by drawing the left, then by ducking it and delivering his right in a swinging hook to the side of the head. It was too high up to be vitally effective; but when first it landed, King knew the old, familiar descent of the black veil of unconsciousness across his mind. For the instant, or for the slighest fraction of an instant, rather, he ceased. In the one moment he saw his opponent ducking out of his field of vision and the background of white, watching faces; in the next moment he again saw his opponent and the background of faces. It was as if he had slept for a time and just opened his eyes again, and yet the interval of unconsciousness was so microscopically short that there had been no time for him to fall. The audience saw him totter and his knees give, and then saw him recover and tuck his chin deeper into the shelter of his left shoulder.  <br><br>  Several times Sandel repeated the blow, keeping King partially dazed, and then the latter worked out his defence, which was also a counter. Feinting with his left he took a half-step backward, at the same time upper cutting with the whole strength of his right. So accurately was it timed that it landed squarely on Sandel's face in the full, downward sweep of the duck, and Sandel lifted in the air and curled backward, striking the mat on his head and shoulders. Twice King achieved this, then turned loose and hammered his opponent to the ropes. He gave Sandel no chance to rest or to set himself, but smashed blow in upon blow till the house rose to its feet and the air was filled with an unbroken roar of applause. But Sandel's strength and endurance were superb, and he continued to stay on his feet. A knock-out seemed certain, and a captain of police, appalled at the dreadful punishment, arose by the ringside to stop the fight. The gong struck for the end of the round and Sandel staggered to his corner, protesting to the captain that he was sound and strong. To prove it, he threw two back-air-springs, and the police captain gave in.  <br><br>  Tom King, leaning back in his corner and breathing hard, was disappointed. If the fight had been stopped, the referee, perforce, would have rendered him the decision and the purse would have been his. Unlike Sandel, he was not fighting for glory or career, but for thirty quid. And now Sandel would recuperate in the minute of rest.  <br><br>  Youth will be served--this saying flashed into King's mind, and he remembered the first time he had heard it, the night when he had put away Stowsher Bill. The toff who had bought him a drink after the fight and patted him on the shoulder had used those words. Youth will be served! The toff was right. And on that night in the long ago he had been Youth. To-night Youth sat in the opposite corner. As for himself, he had been fighting for half an hour now, and he was an old man. Had he fought like Sandel, he would not have lasted fifteen minutes. But the point was that he did not recuperate. Those upstanding arteries and that sorely tried heart would not enable him to gather strength in the intervals between the rounds. And he had not had sufficient strength in him to begin with. His legs were heavy under him and beginning to cramp. He should not have walked those two miles to the fight. And there was the steak which he had got up longing for that morning. A great and terrible hatred rose up in him for the butchers who had refused him credit. It was hard for an old man to go into a fight without enough to eat. And a piece of steak was such a little thing, a few pennies at best; yet it meant thirty quid to him.  <br><br>  With the gong that opened the eleventh round, Sandel rushed, making a show of freshness which he did not really possess. King knew it for what it was--a bluff as old as the game itself. He clinched to save himself, then, going free, allowed Sandel to get set. This was what King desired. He feinted with his left, drew the answering duck and swinging upward hook, then made the half-step backward, delivered the upper cut full to the face and crumpled Sandel over to the mat. After that he never let him rest, receiving punishment himself, but inflicting far more, smashing Sandel to the ropes, hooking and driving all manner of blows into him, tearing away from his clinches or punching him out of attempted clinches, and ever when Sandel would have fallen, catching him with one uplifting hand and with the other immediately smashing him into the ropes where he could not fall.  <br><br>  The house by this time had gone mad, and it was his house, nearly every voice yelling: ""Go it, Tom!"" ""Get 'im! Get 'im!"" ""You've got 'im, Tom! You've got 'im!"" It was to be a whirlwind finish, and that was what a ringside audience paid to see.  <br><br>  And Tom King, who for half an hour had conserved his strength, now expended it prodigally in the one great effort he knew he had in him. It was his one chance--now or not at all. His strength was waning fast, and his hope was that before the last of it ebbed out of him he would have beaten his opponent down for the count. And as he continued to strike and force, coolly estimating the weight of his blows and the quality of the damage wrought, he realized how hard a man Sandel was to knock out. Stamina and endurance were his to an extreme degree, and they were the virgin stamina and endurance of Youth. Sandel was certainly a coming man. He had it in him. Only out of such rugged fibre were successful fighters fashioned.  <br><br>  Sandel was reeling and staggering, but Tom King's legs were cramping and his knuckles going back on him. Yet he steeled himself to strike the fierce blows, every one of which brought anguish to his tortured hands. Though now he was receiving practically no punishment, he was weakening as rapidly as the other. His blows went home, but there was no longer the weight behind them, and each blow was the result of a severe effort of will. His legs were like lead, and they dragged visibly under him; while Sandel's backers, cheered by this symptom, began calling encouragement to their man.  <br><br>  King was spurred to a burst of effort. He delivered two blows in succession--a left, a trifle too high, to the solar plexus, and a right cross to the jaw. They were not heavy blows, yet so weak and dazed was Sandel that he went down and lay quivering. The referee stood over him, shouting the count of the fatal seconds in his ear. If before the tenth second was called, he did not rise, the fight was lost. The house stood in hushed silence. King rested on trembling legs. A mortal dizziness was upon him, and before his eyes the sea of faces sagged and swayed, while to his ears, as from a remote distance, came the count of the referee. Yet he looked upon the fight as his. It was impossible that a man so punished could rise.  <br><br>  Only Youth could rise, and Sandel rose. At the fourth second he rolled over on his face and groped blindly for the ropes. By the seventh second he had dragged himself to his knee, where he rested, his head rolling groggily on his shoulders. As the referee cried ""Nine!"" Sandel stood upright, in proper stalling position, his left arm wrapped about his face, his right wrapped about his stomach. Thus were his vital points guarded, while he lurched forward toward King in the hope of effecting a clinch and gaining more time.  <br><br>  At the instant Sandel arose, King was at him, but the two blows he delivered were muffled on the stalled arms. The next moment Sandel was in the clinch and holding on desperately while the referee strove to drag the two men apart. King helped to force himself free. He knew the rapidity with which Youth recovered, and he knew that Sandel was his if he could prevent that recovery. One stiff punch would do it. Sandel was his, indubitably his. He had out-generalled him, out-fought him, out-pointed him. Sandel reeled out of the clinch, balanced on the hair line between defeat or survival. One good blow would topple him over and down and out. And Tom King, in a flash of bitterness, remembered the piece of steak and wished that he had it then behind that necessary punch he must deliver. He nerved himself for the blow, but it was not heavy enough nor swift enough. Sandel swayed, but did not fall, staggering back to the ropes and holding on. King staggered after him, and, with a pang like that of dissolution, delivered another blow. But his body had deserted him. All that was left of him was a fighting intelligence that was dimmed and clouded from exhaustion. The blow that was aimed for the jaw struck no higher than the shoulder. He had willed the blow higher, but the tired muscles had not been able to obey. And, from the impact of the blow, Tom King himself reeled back and nearly fell. Once again he strove. This time his punch missed altogether, and, from absolute weakness, he fell against Sandel and clinched, holding on to him to save himself from sinking to the floor.  <br><br>  King did not attempt to free himself. He had shot his bolt. He was gone. And Youth had been served. Even in the clinch he could feel Sandel growing stronger against him. When the referee thrust them apart, there, before his eyes, he saw Youth recuperate. From instant to instant Sandel grew stronger. His punches, weak and futile at first, became stiff and accurate. Tom King's bleared eyes saw the gloved fist driving at his jaw, and he willed to guard it by interposing his arm. He saw the danger, willed the act; but the arm was too heavy. It seemed burdened with a hundredweight of lead. It would not lift itself, and he strove to lift it with his soul. Then the gloved fist landed home. He experienced a sharp snap that was like an electric spark, and, simultaneously, the veil of blackness enveloped him.  <br><br>  When he opened his eyes again he was in his corner, and he heard the yelling of the audience like the roar of the surf at Bondi Beach. A wet sponge was being pressed against the base of his brain, and Sid Sullivan was blowing cold water in a refreshing spray over his face and chest. His gloves had already been removed, and Sandel, bending over him, was shaking his hand. He bore no ill-will toward the man who had put him out and he returned the grip with a heartiness that made his battered knuckles protest. Then Sandel stepped to the centre of the ring and the audience hushed its pandemonium to hear him accept young Pronto's challenge and offer to increase the side bet to one hundred pounds. King looked on apathetically while his seconds mopped the streaming water from him, dried his face, and prepared him to leave the ring. He felt hungry. It was not the ordinary, gnawing kind, but a great faintness, a palpitation at the pit of the stomach that communicated itself to all his body. He remembered back into the fight to the moment when he had Sandel swaying and tottering on the hair-line balance of defeat. Ah, that piece of steak would have done it! He had lacked just that for the decisive blow, and he had lost. It was all because of the piece of steak.  <br><br>  His seconds were half-supporting him as they helped him through the ropes. He tore free from them, ducked through the ropes unaided, and leaped heavily to the floor, following on their heels as they forced a passage for him down the crowded centre aisle. Leaving the dressing-room for the street, in the entrance to the hall, some young fellow spoke to him.  <br><br>  ""W'y didn't yuh go in an' get 'im when yuh 'ad 'im?"" the young fellow asked.  <br><br>  ""Aw, go to hell!"" said Tom King, and passed down the steps to the sidewalk.  <br><br>  The doors of the public-house at the corner were swinging wide, and he saw the lights and the smiling barmaids, heard the many voices discussing the fight and the prosperous chink of money on the bar. Somebody called to him to have a drink. He hesitated perceptibly, then refused and went on his way.  <br><br>  He had not a copper in his pocket, and the two-mile walk home seemed very long. He was certainly getting old. Crossing the Domain, he sat down suddenly on a bench, unnerved by the thought of the missus sitting up for him, waiting to learn the outcome of the fight. That was harder than any knockout, and it seemed almost impossible to face.  <br><br>  He felt weak and sore, and the pain of his smashed knuckles warned him that, even if he could find a job at navvy work, it would be a week before he could grip a pick handle or a shovel. The hunger palpitation at the pit of the stomach was sickening. His wretchedness overwhelmed him, and into his eyes came an unwonted moisture. He covered his face with his hands, and, as he cried, he remembered Stowsher Bill and how he had served him that night in the long ago. Poor old Stowsher Bill! He could understand now why Bill had cried in the dressing-room.                               <br><br>"
30,A Wicked Woman,"It was because she had broken with Billy that Loretta had come visiting to Santa Clara. Billy could not understand. His sister had reported that he had walked the floor and cried all night. Loretta had not slept all night either, while she had wept most of the night. Daisy knew this, because it was in her arms that the weeping had been done. And Daisy's husband, Captain Kitt, knew, too. The tears of Loretta, and the comforting by Daisy, had lost him some sleep.<br><br>    Now Captain Kitt did not like to lose sleep. Neither did he want Loretta to marry Billy--nor anybody else. It was Captain Kitt's belief that Daisy needed the help of her younger sister in the household. But he did not say this aloud. Instead, he always insisted that Loretta was too young to think of marriage. So it was Captain Kitt's idea that Loretta should be packed off on a visit to Mrs. Hemingway. There wouldn't be any Billy there.<br><br>    Before Loretta had been at Santa Clara a week, she was convinced that Captain Kitt's idea was a good one. In the first place, though Billy wouldn't believe it, she did not want to marry Billy. And in the second place, though Captain Kitt wouldn't believe it, she did not want to leave Daisy. By the time Loretta had been at Santa Clara two weeks, she was absolutely certain that she did not want to marry Billy. But she was not so sure about not wanting to leave Daisy. Not that she loved Daisy less, but that she--had doubts.<br><br>    The day of Loretta's arrival, a nebulous plan began shaping itself in Mrs. Hemingway's brain. The second day she remarked to Jack Hemingway, her husband, that Loretta was so innocent a young thing that were it not for her sweet guilelessness she would be positively stupid. In proof of which, Mrs. Hemingway told her husband several things that made him chuckle. By the third day Mrs. Hemingway's plan had taken recognizable form. Then it was that she composed a letter. On the envelope she wrote: ""Mr. Edward Bashford, Athenian Club, San Francisco.""<br><br>    ""Dear Ned,"" the letter began. She had once been violently loved by him for three weeks in her pre-marital days. But she had covenanted herself to Jack Hemingway, who had prior claims, and her heart as well; and Ned Bashford had philosophically not broken his heart over it. He merely added the experience to a large fund of similarly collected data out of which he manufactured philosophy. Artistically and temperamentally he was a Greek-- a tired Greek. He was fond of quoting from Nietzsche, in token that he, too, had passed through the long sickness that follows upon the ardent search for truth; that he too had emerged, too experienced, too shrewd, too profound, ever again to be afflicted by the madness of youths in their love of truth. ""'To worship appearance,'"" he often quoted; ""'to believe in forms, in tones, in words, in the whole Olympus of appearance!'"" This particular excerpt he always concluded with, ""'Those Greeks were superficial--OUT OF PROFUNDITY!'""<br><br>    He was a fairly young Greek, jaded and worn. Women were faithless and unveracious, he held--at such times that he had relapses and descended to pessimism from his wonted high philosophical calm. He did not believe in the truth of women; but, faithful to his German master, he did not strip from them the airy gauzes that veiled their untruth. He was content to accept them as appearances and to make the best of it. He was superficial- -OUT OF PROFUNDITY.<br><br>    ""Jack says to be sure to say to you, 'good swimming,'"" Mrs. Hemingway wrote in her letter; ""and also 'to bring your fishing duds along.'"" Mrs. Hemingway wrote other things in the letter. She told him that at last she was prepared to exhibit to him an absolutely true, unsullied, and innocent woman. ""A more guileless, immaculate bud of womanhood never blushed on the planet,"" was one of the several ways in which she phrased the inducement. And to her husband she said triumphantly, ""If I don't marry Ned off this time--"" leaving unstated the terrible alternative that she lacked either vocabulary to express or imagination to conceive.<br><br>    Contrary to all her forebodings, Loretta found that she was not unhappy at Santa Clara. Truly, Billy wrote to her every day, but his letters were less distressing than his presence. Also, the ordeal of being away from Daisy was not so severe as she had expected. For the first time in her life she was not lost in eclipse in the blaze of Daisy's brilliant and mature personality. Under such favourable circumstances Loretta came rapidly to the front, while Mrs. Hemingway modestly and shamelessly retreated into the background.<br><br>    Loretta began to discover that she was not a pale orb shining by reflection. Quite unconsciously she became a small centre of things. When she was at the piano, there was some one to turn the pages for her and to express preferences for certain songs. When she dropped her handkerchief, there was some one to pick it up. And there was some one to accompany her in ramblings and flower gatherings. Also, she learned to cast flies in still pools and below savage riffles, and how not to entangle silk lines and gut-leaders with the shrubbery.<br><br>    Jack Hemingway did not care to teach beginners, and fished much by himself, or not at all, thus giving Ned Bashford ample time in which to consider Loretta as an appearance. As such, she was all that his philosophy demanded. Her blue eyes had the direct gaze of a boy, and out of his profundity he delighted in them and forbore to shudder at the duplicity his philosophy bade him to believe lurked in their depths. She had the grace of a slender flower, the fragility of colour and line of fine china, in all of which he pleasured greatly, without thought of the Life Force palpitating beneath and in spite of Bernard Shaw--in whom he believed.<br><br>    Loretta burgeoned. She swiftly developed personality. She discovered a will of her own and wishes of her own that were not everlastingly entwined with the will and the wishes of Daisy. She was petted by Jack Hemingway, spoiled by Alice Hemingway, and devotedly attended by Ned Bashford. They encouraged her whims and laughed at her follies, while she developed the pretty little tyrannies that are latent in all pretty and delicate women. Her environment acted as a soporific upon her ancient desire always to live with Daisy. This desire no longer prodded her as in the days of her companionship with Billy. The more she saw of Billy, the more certain she had been that she could not live away from Daisy. The more she saw of Ned Bashford, the more she forgot her pressing need of Daisy.<br><br>    Ned Bashford likewise did some forgetting. He confused superficiality with profundity, and entangled appearance with reality until he accounted them one. Loretta was different from other women. There was no masquerade about her. She was real. He said as much to Mrs. Hemingway, and more, who agreed with him and at the same time caught her husband's eyelid drooping down for the moment in an unmistakable wink.<br><br>    It was at this time that Loretta received a letter from Billy that was somewhat different from his others. In the main, like all his letters, it was pathological. It was a long recital of symptoms and sufferings, his nervousness, his sleeplessness, and the state of his heart. Then followed reproaches, such as he had never made before. They were sharp enough to make her weep, and true enough to put tragedy into her face. This tragedy she carried down to the breakfast table. It made Jack and Mrs. Hemingway speculative, and it worried Ned. They glanced to him for explanation, but he shook his head.<br><br>    ""I'll find out to-night,"" Mrs. Hemingway said to her husband.<br><br>    But Ned caught Loretta in the afternoon in the big living-room. She tried to turn away. He caught her hands, and she faced him with wet lashes and trembling lips. He looked at her, silently and kindly. The lashes grew wetter.<br><br>    ""There, there, don't cry, little one,"" he said soothingly.<br><br>    He put his arm protectingly around her shoulder. And to his shoulder, like a tired child, she turned her face. He thrilled in ways unusual for a Greek who has recovered from the long sickness.<br><br>    ""Oh, Ned,"" she sobbed on his shoulder, ""if you only knew how wicked I am!""<br><br>    He smiled indulgently, and breathed in a great breath freighted with the fragrance of her hair. He thought of his world-experience of women, and drew another long breath. There seemed to emanate from her the perfect sweetness of a child--""the aura of a white soul,"" was the way he phrased it to himself.<br><br>    Then he noticed that her sobs were increasing.<br><br>    ""What's the matter, little one?"" he asked pettingly and almost paternally. ""Has Jack been bullying you? Or has your dearly beloved sister failed to write?""<br><br>    She did not answer, and he felt that he really must kiss her hair, that he could not be responsible if the situation continued much longer.<br><br>    ""Tell me,"" he said gently, ""and we'll see what I can do.""<br><br>    ""I can't. You will despise me.--Oh, Ned, I am so ashamed!""<br><br>    He laughed incredulously, and lightly touched her hair with his lips--so lightly that she did not know.<br><br>    ""Dear little one, let us forget all about it, whatever it is. I want to tell you how I love--""<br><br>    She uttered a sharp cry that was all delight, and then moaned--<br><br>    ""Too late!""<br><br>    ""Too late?"" he echoed in surprise.<br><br>    ""Oh, why did I? Why did I?"" she was moaning.<br><br>    He was aware of a swift chill at his heart.<br><br>    ""What?"" he asked.<br><br>    ""Oh, I . . . he . . . Billy.<br><br>    ""I am such a wicked woman, Ned. I know you will never speak to me again.""<br><br>    ""This--er--this Billy,"" he began haltingly. ""He is your brother?""<br><br>    ""No . . . he . . . I didn't know. I was so young. I could not help it. Oh, I shall go mad! I shall go mad!""<br><br>    It was then that Loretta felt his shoulder and the encircling arm become limp. He drew away from her gently, and gently he deposited her in a big chair, where she buried her face and sobbed afresh. He twisted his moustache fiercely, then drew up another chair and sat down.<br><br>    ""I--I do not understand,"" he said.<br><br>    ""I am so unhappy,"" she wailed.<br><br>    ""Why unhappy?""<br><br>    ""Because . . . he . . . he wants me to marry him.""<br><br>    His face cleared on the instant, and he placed a hand soothingly on hers.<br><br>    ""That should not make any girl unhappy,"" he remarked sagely. ""Because you don't love him is no reason--of course, you don't love him?""<br><br>    Loretta shook her head and shoulders in a vigorous negative.<br><br>    ""What?""<br><br>    Bashford wanted to make sure.<br><br>    ""No,"" she asserted explosively. ""I don't love Billy! I don't want to love Billy!""<br><br>    ""Because you don't love him,"" Bashford resumed with confidence, ""is no reason that you should be unhappy just because he has proposed to you.""<br><br>    She sobbed again, and from the midst of her sobs she cried--<br><br>    ""That's the trouble. I wish I did love him. Oh, I wish I were dead!""<br><br>    ""Now, my dear child, you are worrying yourself over trifles."" His other hand crossed over after its mate and rested on hers. ""Women do it every day. Because you have changed your mind or did not know your mind, because you have--to use an unnecessarily harsh word--jilted a man--""<br><br>    ""Jilted!"" She had raised her head and was looking at him with tear-dimmed eyes. ""Oh, Ned, if that were all!""<br><br>    ""All?"" he asked in a hollow voice, while his hands slowly retreated from hers. He was about to speak further, then remained silent.<br><br>    ""But I don't want to marry him,"" Loretta broke forth protestingly.<br><br>    ""Then I shouldn't,"" he counselled.<br><br>    ""But I ought to marry him.""<br><br>    ""OUGHT to marry him?""<br><br>    She nodded.<br><br>    ""That is a strong word.""<br><br>    ""I know it is,"" she acquiesced, while she strove to control her trembling lips. Then she spoke more calmly. ""I am a wicked woman, a terribly wicked woman. No one knows how wicked I am--except Billy.""<br><br>    There was a pause. Ned Bashford's face was grave, and he looked queerly at Loretta.<br><br>    ""He--Billy knows?"" he asked finally.<br><br>    A reluctant nod and flaming cheeks was the reply.<br><br>    He debated with himself for a while, seeming, like a diver, to be preparing himself for the plunge.<br><br>    ""Tell me about it."" He spoke very firmly. ""You must tell me all of it.""<br><br>    ""And will you--ever--forgive me?"" she asked in a faint, small voice.<br><br>    He hesitated, drew a long breath, and made the plunge.<br><br>    ""Yes,"" he said desperately. ""I'll forgive you. Go ahead.""<br><br>    ""There was no one to tell me,"" she began. ""We were with each other so much. I did not know anything of the world--then.""<br><br>    She paused to meditate. Bashford was biting his lip impatiently.<br><br>    ""If I had only known--""<br><br>    She paused again.<br><br>    ""Yes, go on,"" he urged.<br><br>    ""We were together almost every evening.""<br><br>    ""Billy?"" he demanded, with a savageness that startled her.<br><br>    ""Yes, of course, Billy. We were with each other so much . . . If I had only known . . . There was no one to tell me . . . I was so young--""<br><br>    Her lips parted as though to speak further, and she regarded him anxiously.<br><br>    ""The scoundrel!""<br><br>    With the explosion Ned Bashford was on his feet, no longer a tired Greek, but a violently angry young man.<br><br>    ""Billy is not a scoundrel; he is a good man,"" Loretta defended, with a firmness that surprised Bashford.<br><br>    ""I suppose you'll be telling me next that it was all your fault,"" he said sarcastically.<br><br>    She nodded.<br><br>    ""What?"" he shouted.<br><br>    ""It was all my fault,"" she said steadily. ""I should never have let him. I was to blame.""<br><br>    Bashford ceased from his pacing up and down, and when he spoke, his voice was resigned.<br><br>    ""All right,"" he said. ""I don't blame you in the least, Loretta. And you have been very honest. But Billy is right, and you are wrong. You must get married.""<br><br>    ""To Billy?"" she asked, in a dim, far-away voice.<br><br>    ""Yes, to Billy. I'll see to it. Where does he live? I'll make him.""<br><br>    ""But I don't want to marry Billy!"" she cried out in alarm. ""Oh, Ned, you won't do that?""<br><br>    ""I shall,"" he answered sternly. ""You must. And Billy must. Do you understand?""<br><br>    Loretta buried her face in the cushioned chair back, and broke into a passionate storm of sobs.<br><br>    All that Bashford could make out at first, as he listened, was: ""But I don't want to leave Daisy! I don't want to leave Daisy!""<br><br>    He paced grimly back and forth, then stopped curiously to listen.<br><br>    ""How was I to know?--Boo--hoo,"" Loretta was crying. ""He didn't tell me. Nobody else ever kissed me. I never dreamed a kiss could be so terrible . . . until, boo-hoo . . . until he wrote to me. I only got the letter this morning.""<br><br>    His face brightened. It seemed as though light was dawning on him.<br><br>    ""Is that what you're crying about?""<br><br>    ""N--no.""<br><br>    His heart sank.<br><br>    ""Then what are you crying about?"" he asked in a hopeless voice.<br><br>    ""Because you said I had to marry Billy. And I don't want to marry Billy. I don't want to leave Daisy. I don't know what I want. I wish I were dead.""<br><br>    He nerved himself for another effort.<br><br>    ""Now look here, Loretta, be sensible. What is this about kisses. You haven't told me everything?""<br><br>    ""I--I don't want to tell you everything.""<br><br>    She looked at him beseechingly in the silence that fell.<br><br>    ""Must I?"" she quavered finally.<br><br>    ""You must,"" he said imperatively. ""You must tell me everything.""<br><br>    ""Well, then . . . must I?""<br><br>    ""You must.""<br><br>    ""He . . . I . . . we . . ."" she began flounderingly. Then blurted out, ""I let him, and he kissed me.""<br><br>    ""Go on,"" Bashford commanded desperately.<br><br>    ""That's all,"" she answered.<br><br>    ""All?"" There was a vast incredulity in his voice.<br><br>    ""All?"" In her voice was an interrogation no less vast.<br><br>    ""I mean--er--nothing worse?"" He was overwhelmingly aware of his own awkwardness.<br><br>    ""Worse?"" She was frankly puzzled. ""As though there could be! Billy said- -""<br><br>    ""When did he say it?"" Bashford demanded abruptly.<br><br>    ""In his letter I got this morning. Billy said that my . . . our . . . our kisses were terrible if we didn't get married.""<br><br>    Bashford's head was swimming.<br><br>    ""What else did Billy say?"" he asked.<br><br>    ""He said that when a woman allowed a man to kiss her, she always married him--that it was terrible if she didn't. It was the custom, he said; and I say it is a bad, wicked custom, and I don't like it. I know I'm terrible,"" she added defiantly, ""but I can't help it.""<br><br>    Bashford absent-mindedly brought out a cigarette.<br><br>    ""Do you mind if I smoke?"" he asked, as he struck a match.<br><br>    Then he came to himself.<br><br>    ""I beg your pardon,"" he cried, flinging away match and cigarette. ""I don't want to smoke. I didn't mean that at all. What I mean is--""<br><br>    He bent over Loretta, caught her hands in his, then sat on the arm of the chair and softly put one arm around her.<br><br>    ""Loretta, I am a fool. I mean it. And I mean something more. I want you to be my wife.""<br><br>    He waited anxiously in the pause that followed.<br><br>    ""You might answer me,"" he urged.<br><br>    ""I will . . . if--""<br><br>    ""Yes, go on. If what?""<br><br>    ""If I don't have to marry Billy.""<br><br>    ""You can't marry both of us,"" he almost shouted.<br><br>    ""And it isn't the custom . . . what. . . what Billy said?""<br><br>    ""No, it isn't the custom. Now, Loretta, will you marry me?""<br><br>    ""Don't be angry with me,"" she pouted demurely.<br><br>    He gathered her into his arms and kissed her.<br><br>    ""I wish it were the custom,"" she said in a faint voice, from the midst of the embrace, ""because then I'd have to marry you, Ned dear . . . wouldn't I?""                                    <br><br>"
31,Grit of Women,"A wolfish head, wistful-eyed and frost-rimed, thrust aside the tent-flaps.  <br><br>""Hi!  Chook!  Siwash!  Chook, you limb of Satan!"" chorused the protesting inmates.  Bettles rapped the dog sharply with a tin plate, and it withdrew hastily.  Louis Savoy refastened the flaps, kicked a frying-pan over against the bottom, and warmed his hands. It was very cold without.  Forty-eight hours gone, the spirit thermometer had burst at sixty-eight below, and since that time it had grown steadily and bitterly colder.  There was no telling when the snap would end.  And it is poor policy, unless the gods will it, to venture far from a stove at such times, or to increase the quantity of cold atmosphere one must breathe.  Men sometimes do it, and sometimes they chill their lungs.  This leads up to a dry, hacking cough, noticeably irritable when bacon is being fried. After that, somewhere along in the spring or summer, a hole is burned in the frozen muck.  Into this a man's carcass is dumped, covered over with moss, and left with the assurance that it will rise on the crack of Doom, wholly and frigidly intact.  For those of little faith, sceptical of material integration on that fateful day, no fitter country than the Klondike can be recommended to die in.  But it is not to be inferred from this that it is a fit country for living purposes.   <br><br>It was very cold without, but it was not over-warm within.  The only article which might be designated furniture was the stove, and for this the men were frank in displaying their preference. Upon half of the floor pine boughs had been cast; above this were spread the sleeping-furs, beneath lay the winter's snowfall.  The remainder of the floor was moccasin-packed snow, littered with pots and pans and the general impedimenta of an Arctic camp.  The stove was red and roaring hot, but only a bare three feet away lay a block of ice, as sharp-edged and dry as when first quarried from the creek bottom.  The pressure of the outside cold forced the inner heat upward.  Just above the stove, where the pipe penetrated the roof, was a tiny circle of dry canvas; next, with the pipe always as centre, a circle of steaming canvas; next a damp and moisture-exuding ring; and finally, the rest of the tent, sidewalls and top, coated with a half-inch of dry, white, crystal- encrusted frost.  <br><br>""Oh!  <i>Oh!  Oh!</i>""  A young fellow, lying asleep in the furs, bearded and wan and weary, raised a moan of pain, and without waking increased the pitch and intensity of his anguish.  His body half- lifted from the blankets, and quivered and shrank spasmodically, as though drawing away from a bed of nettles.   <br><br>""Roll'm over!"" ordered Bettles.  ""He's crampin'.""  <br><br>And thereat, with pitiless good-will, he was pitched upon and rolled and thumped and pounded by half-a-dozen willing comrades.   <br><br>""Damn the trail,"" he muttered softly, as he threw off the robes and sat up.  ""I've run across country, played quarter three seasons hand-running, and hardened myself in all manner of ways; and then I pilgrim it into this God-forsaken land and find myself an effeminate Athenian without the simplest rudiments of manhood!"" He hunched up to the fire and rolled a cigarette.  ""Oh, I'm not whining.  I can take my medicine all right, all right; but I'm just decently ashamed of myself, that's all.  Here I am, on top of a dirty thirty miles, as knocked up and stiff and sore as a pink- tea degenerate after a five-mile walk on a country turn-pike. Bah!  It makes me sick!  Got a match?""  ""Don't git the tantrums, youngster.""  Bettles passed over the required fire-stick and waxed patriarchal.  ""Ye've gotter 'low some for the breakin'-in. Sufferin' cracky! don't I recollect the first time I hit the trail!  Stiff?  I've seen the time it'd take me ten minutes to git my mouth from the waterhole an' come to my feet--every jint crackin' an' kickin' fit to kill.  Cramp?  In sech knots it'd take the camp half a day to untangle me.  You're all right, for a cub, any ye've the true sperrit.  Come this day year, you'll walk all us old bucks into the ground any time.  An' best in your favor, you hain't got that streak of fat in your make-up which has sent many a husky man to the bosom of Abraham afore his right and proper time.""  <br><br>""Streak of fat?""   <br><br>""Yep.  Comes along of bulk.  'T ain't the big men as is the best when it comes to the trail.""  <br><br>""Never heard of it.""   <br><br>""Never heered of it, eh?  Well, it's a dead straight, open-an'- shut fact, an' no gittin' round.  Bulk's all well enough for a mighty big effort, but 'thout stayin' powers it ain't worth a continental whoop; an' stayin' powers an' bulk ain't runnin' mates.  Takes the small, wiry fellows when it comes to gittin' right down an' hangin' on like a lean-jowled dog to a bone.  Why, hell's fire, the big men they ain't in it!""  <br><br>""By gar!"" broke in Louis Savoy, ""dat is no, vot you call, josh!  I know one mans, so vaire beeg like ze buffalo.  Wit him, on ze Sulphur Creek stampede, go one small mans, Lon McFane.  You know dat Lon McFane, dat leetle Irisher wit ze red hair and ze grin. An' dey walk an' walk an' walk, all ze day long an' ze night long. And beeg mans, him become vaire tired, an' lay down mooch in ze snow.  And leetle mans keek beeg mans, an' him cry like, vot you call--ah! vot you call ze kid.  And leetle mans keek an' keek an' keek, an' bime by, long time, long way, keek beeg mans into my cabin.  Tree days 'fore him crawl out my blankets.  Nevaire I see beeg squaw like him.  No nevaire.  Him haf vot you call ze streak of fat.  You bet.""   <br><br>""But there was Axel Gunderson,"" Prince spoke up.  The great Scandinavian, with the tragic events which shadowed his passing, had made a deep mark on the mining engineer.  ""He lies up there, somewhere.""  He swept his hand in the vague direction of the mysterious east.  <br><br>""Biggest man that ever turned his heels to Salt Water, or run a moose down with sheer grit,"" supplemented Bettles; ""but he's the prove-the-rule exception.  Look at his woman, Unga,--tip the scales at a hundred an' ten, clean meat an' nary ounce to spare. She'd bank grit 'gainst his for all there was in him, an' see him, an' go him better if it was possible.  Nothing over the earth, or in it, or under it, she wouldn't 'a' done.""   <br><br>""But she loved him,"" objected the engineer.  <br><br>""'T ain't that.  It--""   <br><br>""Look you, brothers,"" broke in Sitka Charley from his seat on the grub-box.  ""Ye have spoken of the streak of fat that runs in big men's muscles, of the grit of women and the love, and ye have spoken fair; but I have in mind things which happened when the land was young and the fires of men apart as the stars.  It was then I had concern with a big man, and a streak of fat, and a woman.  And the woman was small; but her heart was greater than the beef-heart of the man, and she had grit.  And we traveled a weary trail, even to the Salt Water, and the cold was bitter, the snow deep, the hunger great.  And the woman's love was a mighty love--no more can man say than this.""  <br><br>He paused, and with the hatchet broke pieces of ice from the large chunk beside him.  These he threw into the gold pan on the stove, where the drinking-water thawed.  The men drew up closer, and he of the cramps sought greater comfort vainly for his stiffened body.   <br><br>""Brothers, my blood is red with Siwash, but my heart is white.  To the faults of my fathers I owe the one, to the virtues of my friends the other.  A great truth came to me when I was yet a boy. I learned that to your kind and you was given the earth; that the Siwash could not withstand you, and like the caribou and the bear, must perish in the cold.  So I came into the warm and sat among you, by your fires, and behold, I became one of you, I have seen much in my time.  I have known strange things, and bucked big, on big trails, with men of many breeds.  And because of these things, I measure deeds after your manner, and judge men, and think thoughts.  Wherefore, when I speak harshly of one of your own kind, I know you will not take it amiss; and when I speak high of one of my father's people, you will not take it upon you to say, 'Sitka Charley is Siwash, and there is a crooked light in his eyes and small honor to his tongue.'  Is it not so?""  <br><br>Deep down in throat, the circle vouchsafed its assent.   <br><br>""The woman was Passuk.  I got her in fair trade from her people, who were of the Coast and whose Chilcat totem stood at the head of a salt arm of the sea.  My heart did not go out to the woman, nor did I take stock of her looks.  For she scarce took her eyes from the ground, and she was timid and afraid, as girls will be when cast into a stranger's arms whom they have never seen before.  As I say, there was no place in my heart for her to creep, for I had a great journey in mind, and stood in need of one to feed my dogs and to lift a paddle with me through the long river days.  One blanket would cover the twain; so I chose Passuk.  <br><br>""Have I not said I was a servant to the Government?  If not, it is well that ye know.  So I was taken on a warship, sleds and dogs and evaporated foods, and with me came Passuk.  And we went north, to the winter ice-rim of Bering Sea, where we were landed,-- myself, and Passuk, and the dogs.  I was also given moneys of the Government, for I was its servant, and charts of lands which the eyes of man had never dwelt upon, and messages.  These messages were sealed, and protected shrewdly from the weather, and I was to deliver them to the whale-ships of the Arctic, ice-bound by the great Mackenzie.  Never was there so great a river, forgetting only our own Yukon, the Mother of all Rivers.   <br><br>""All of which is neither here nor there, for my story deals not with the whale-ships, nor the berg-bound winter I spent by the Mackenzie.  Afterward, in the spring, when the days lengthened and there was a crust to the snow, we came south, Passuk and I, to the Country of the Yukon.  A weary journey, but the sun pointed out the way of our feet.  It was a naked land then, as I have said, and we worked up the current, with pole and paddle, till we came to Forty Mile.  Good it was to see white faces once again, so we put into the bank.  And that winter was a hard winter.  The darkness and the cold drew down upon us, and with them the famine. To each man the agent of the Company gave forty pounds of flour and twenty of bacon.  There were no beans.  And, the dogs howled always, and there were flat bellies and deep-lined faces, and strong men became weak, and weak men died.  There was also much scurvy.  <br><br>""Then came we together in the store one night, and the empty shelves made us feel our own emptiness the more.  We talked low, by the light of the fire, for the candles had been set aside for those who might yet gasp in the spring.  Discussion was held, and it was said that a man must go forth to the Salt Water and tell to the world our misery.  At this all eyes turned to me, for it was understood that I was a great traveler.  'It is seven hundred miles,' said I, 'to Haines Mission by the sea, and every inch of it snowshoe work.  Give me the pick of your dogs and the best of your grub, and I will go.  And with me shall go Passuk.'   <br><br>""To this they were agreed.  But there arose one, Long Jeff, a Yankee-man, big-boned and big-muscled.  Also his talk was big. He, too, was a mighty traveler, he said, born to the snowshoe and bred up on buffalo milk.  He would go with me, in case I fell by the trail, that he might carry the word on to the Mission.  I was young, and I knew not Yankee-men.  How was I to know that big talk betokened the streak of fat, or that Yankee-men who did great things kept their teeth together?  So we took the pick of the dogs and the best of the grub, and struck the trail, we three,--Passuk, Long Jeff, and I.  <br><br>""Well, ye have broken virgin snow, labored at the gee-pole, and are not unused to the packed river-jams; so I will talk little of the toil, save that on some days we made ten miles, and on others thirty, but more often ten.  And the best of the grub was not good, while we went on stint from the start.  Likewise the pick of the dogs was poor, and we were hard put to keep them on their legs.  At the White River our three sleds became two sleds, and we had only come two hundred miles.  But we lost nothing; the dogs that left the traces went into the bellies of those that remained.   <br><br>""Not a greeting, not a curl of smoke, till we made Pelly.  Here I had counted on grub; and here I had counted on leaving Long Jeff, who was whining and trail-sore.  But the factor's lungs were wheezing, his eyes bright, his cache nigh empty; and he showed us the empty cache of the missionary, also his grave with the rocks piled high to keep off the dogs.  There was a bunch of Indians there, but babies and old men there were none, and it was clear that few would see the spring.  <br><br>""So we pulled on, light-stomached and heavy-hearted, with half a thousand miles of snow and silence between us and Haines Mission by the sea.  The darkness was at its worst, and at midday the sun could not clear the sky-line to the south.  But the ice-jams were smaller, the going better; so I pushed the dogs hard and traveled late and early.  As I said at Forty Mile, every inch of it was snow-shoe work.  And the shoes made great sores on our feet, which cracked and scabbed but would not heal.  And every day these sores grew more grievous, till in the morning, when we girded on the shoes, Long Jeff cried like a child.  I put him at the fore of the light sled to break trail, but he slipped off the shoes for comfort.  Because of this the trail was not packed, his moccasins made great holes, and into these holes the dogs wallowed.  The bones of the dogs were ready to break through their hides, and this was not good for them.  So I spoke hard words to the man, and he promised, and broke his word.  Then I beat him with the dog- whip, and after that the dogs wallowed no more.  He was a child, what of the pain and the streak of fat.   <br><br>""But Passuk.  While the man lay by the fire and wept, she cooked, and in the morning helped lash the sleds, and in the evening to unlash them.  And she saved the dogs.  Ever was she to the fore, lifting the webbed shoes and making the way easy.  Passuk--how shall I say?--I took it for granted that she should do these things, and thought no more about it.  For my mind was busy with other matters, and besides, I was young in years and knew little of woman.  It was only on looking back that I came to understand.  <br><br>""And the man became worthless.  The dogs had little strength in them, but he stole rides on the sled when he lagged behind. Passuk said she would take the one sled, so the man had nothing to do.  In the morning I gave him his fair share of grub and started him on the trail alone.  Then the woman and I broke camp, packed the sleds, and harnessed the dogs.  By midday, when the sun mocked us, we would overtake the man, with the tears frozen on his cheeks, and pass him.  In the night we made camp, set aside his fair share of grub, and spread his furs.  Also we made a big fire, that he might see.  And hours afterward he would come limping in, and eat his grub with moans and groans, and sleep.  He was not sick, this man.  He was only trail-sore and tired, and weak with hunger.  But Passuk and I were trail-sore and tired, and weak with hunger; and we did all the work and he did none.  But he had the streak of fat of which our brother Bettles has spoken.  Further, we gave the man always his fair share of grub.   <br><br>""Then one day we met two ghosts journeying through the Silence. They were a man and a boy, and they were white.  The ice had opened on Lake Le Barge, and through it had gone their main outfit.  One blanket each carried about his shoulders.  At night they built a fire and crouched over it till morning.  They had a little flour.  This they stirred in warm water and drank.  The man showed me eight cups of flour--all they had, and Pelly, stricken with famine, two hundred miles away.  They said, also, that there was an Indian behind; that they had whacked fair, but that he could not keep up.  I did not believe they had whacked fair, else would the Indian have kept up.  But I could give them no grub. They strove to steal a dog--the fattest, which was very thin--but I shoved my pistol in their faces and told them begone.  And they went away, like drunken men, through the Silence toward Pelly.  <br><br>""I had three dogs now, and one sled, and the dogs were only bones and hair.  When there is little wood, the fire burns low and the cabin grows cold.  So with us.  With little grub the frost bites sharp, and our faces were black and frozen till our own mothers would not have known us.  And our feet were very sore.  In the morning, when I hit the trail, I sweated to keep down the cry when the pain of the snowshoes smote me.  Passuk never opened her lips, but stepped to the fore to break the way.  The man howled.   <br><br>""The Thirty Mile was swift, and the current ate away the ice from beneath, and there were many air-holes and cracks, and much open water.  One day we came upon the man, resting, for he had gone ahead, as was his wont, in the morning.  But between us was open water.  This he had passed around by taking to the rim-ice where it was too narrow for a sled.  So we found an ice-bridge.  Passuk weighed little, and went first, with a long pole crosswise in her hands in chance she broke through.  But she was light, and her shoes large, and she passed over.  Then she called the dogs.  But they had neither poles nor shoes, and they broke through and were swept under by the water.  I held tight to the sled from behind, till the traces broke and the dogs went on down under the ice. There was little meat to them, but I had counted on them for a week's grub, and they were gone.  <br><br>""The next morning I divided all the grub, which was little, into three portions.  And I told Long Jeff that he could keep up with us, or not, as he saw fit; for we were going to travel light and fast.  But he raised his voice and cried over his sore feet and his troubles, and said harsh things against comradeship.  Passuk's feet were sore, and my feet were sore--ay, sorer than his, for we had worked with the dogs; also, we looked to see.  Long Jeff swore he would die before he hit the trail again; so Passuk took a fur robe, and I a cooking pot and an axe, and we made ready to go. But she looked on the man's portion, and said, 'It is wrong to waste good food on a baby.  He is better dead.'  I shook my head and said no--that a comrade once was a comrade always.  Then she spoke of the men of Forty Mile; that they were many men and good; and that they looked to me for grub in the spring.  But when I still said no, she snatched the pistol from my belt, quick, and as our brother Bettles has spoken, Long Jeff went to the bosom of Abraham before his time.  I chided Passuk for this; but she showed no sorrow, nor was she sorrowful.  And in my heart I knew she was right.""   <br><br>Sitka Charley paused and threw pieces of ice into the gold pan on the stove.  The men were silent, and their backs chilled to the sobbing cries of the dogs as they gave tongue to their misery in the outer cold.  <br><br>""And day by day we passed in the snow the sleeping-places of the two ghosts--Passuk and I--and we knew we would be glad for such ere we made Salt Water.  Then we came to the Indian, like another ghost, with his face set toward Pelly.  They had not whacked up fair, the man and the boy, he said, and he had had no flour for three days.  Each night he boiled pieces of his moccasins in a cup, and ate them.  He did not have much moccasins left.  And he was a Coast Indian, and told us these things through Passuk, who talked his tongue.  He was a stranger in the Yukon, and he knew not the way, but his face was set to Pelly.  How far was it?  Two sleeps? ten? a hundred--he did not know, but he was going to Pelly.  It was too far to turn back; he could only keep on.   <br><br>""He did not ask for grub, for he could see we, too, were hard put. Passuk looked at the man, and at me, as though she were of two minds, like a mother partridge whose young are in trouble.  So I turned to her and said, 'This man has been dealt unfair.  Shall I give him of our grub a portion?'  I saw her eyes light, as with quick pleasure; but she looked long at the man and at me, and her mouth drew close and hard, and she said, 'No.  The Salt Water is afar off, and Death lies in wait.  Better it is that he take this stranger man and let my man Charley pass.'  So the man went away in the Silence toward Pelly.  That night she wept.  Never had I seen her weep before.  Nor was it the smoke of the fire, for the wood was dry wood.  So I marveled at her sorrow, and thought her woman's heart had grown soft at the darkness of the trail and the pain.  <br><br>""Life is a strange thing.  Much have I thought on it, and pondered long, yet daily the strangeness of it grows not less, but more. Why this longing for Life?  It is a game which no man wins.  To live is to toil hard, and to suffer sore, till Old Age creeps heavily upon us and we throw down our hands on the cold ashes of dead fires.  It is hard to live.  In pain the babe sucks his first breath, in pain the old man gasps his last, and all his days are full of trouble and sorrow; yet he goes down to the open arms of Death, stumbling, falling, with head turned backward, fighting to the last.  And Death is kind.  It is only Life, and the things of Life that hurt.  Yet we love Life, and we hate Death.  It is very strange.   <br><br>""We spoke little, Passuk and I, in the days which came.  In the night we lay in the snow like dead people, and in the morning we went on our way, walking like dead people.  And all things were dead.  There were no ptarmigan, no squirrels, no snowshoe rabbits,--nothing.  The river made no sound beneath its white robes.  The sap was frozen in the forest.  And it became cold, as now; and in the night the stars drew near and large, and leaped and danced; and in the day the sun-dogs mocked us till we saw many suns, and all the air flashed and sparkled, and the snow was diamond dust.  And there was no heat, no sound, only the bitter cold and the Silence.  As I say, we walked like dead people, as in a dream, and we kept no count of time.  Only our faces were set to Salt Water, our souls strained for Salt Water, and our feet carried us toward Salt Water.  We camped by the Tahkeena, and knew it not.  Our eyes looked upon the White Horse, but we saw it not. Our feet trod the portage of the Canyon, but they felt it not.  We felt nothing.  And we fell often by the way, but we fell, always, with our faces toward Salt Water.  <br><br>""Our last grub went, and we had shared fair, Passuk and I, but she fell more often, and at Caribou Crossing her strength left her. And in the morning we lay beneath the one robe and did not take the trail.  It was in my mind to stay there and meet Death hand- in-hand with Passuk; for I had grown old, and had learned the love of woman.  Also, it was eighty miles to Haines Mission, and the great Chilcoot, far above the timber-line, reared his storm-swept head between.  But Passuk spoke to me, low, with my ear against her lips that I might hear.  And now, because she need not fear my anger, she spoke her heart, and told me of her love, and of many things which I did not understand.   <br><br>""And she said:  'You are my man, Charley, and I have been a good woman to you.  And in all the days I have made your fire, and cooked your food, and fed your dogs, and lifted paddle or broken trail, I have not complained.  Nor did I say that there was more warmth in the lodge of my father, or that there was more grub on the Chilcat.  When you have spoken, I have listened.  When you have ordered, I have obeyed.  Is it not so, Charley?'  <br><br>""And I said:  'Ay, it is so.'   <br><br>""And she said:  'When first you came to the Chilcat, nor looked upon me, but bought me as a man buys a dog, and took me away, my heart was hard against you and filled with bitterness and fear. But that was long ago.  For you were kind to me, Charley, as a good man is kind to his dog.  Your heart was cold, and there was no room for me; yet you dealt me fair and your ways were just. And I was with you when you did bold deeds and led great ventures, and I measured you against the men of other breeds, and I saw you stood among them full of honor, and your word was wise, your tongue true.  And I grew proud of you, till it came that you filled all my heart, and all my thought was of you.  You were as the midsummer sun, when its golden trail runs in a circle and never leaves the sky.  And whatever way I cast my eyes I beheld the sun.  But your heart was ever cold, Charley, and there was no room.'  <br><br>""And I said:  'It is so.  It was cold, and there was no room.  But that is past.  Now my heart is like the snowfall in the spring, when the sun has come back.  There is a great thaw and a bending, a sound of running waters, and a budding and sprouting of green things.  And there is drumming of partridges, and songs of robins, and great music, for the winter is broken, Passuk, and I have learned the love of woman.'   <br><br>""She smiled and moved for me to draw her closer.  And she said, 'I am glad.'  After that she lay quiet for a long time, breathing softly, her head upon my breast.  Then she whispered:  'The trail ends here, and I am tired.  But first I would speak of other things.  In the long ago, when I was a girl on the Chilcat, I played alone among the skin bales of my father's lodge; for the men were away on the hunt, and the women and boys were dragging in the meat.  It was in the spring, and I was alone.  A great brown bear, just awake from his winter's sleep, hungry, his fur hanging to the bones in flaps of leanness, shoved his head within the lodge and said, ""Oof!""  My brother came running back with the first sled of meat.  And he fought the bear with burning sticks from the fire, and the dogs in their harnesses, with the sled behind them, fell upon the bear.  There was a great battle and much noise.  They rolled in the fire, the skin bales were scattered, the lodge overthrown.  But in the end the bear lay dead, with the fingers of my brother in his mouth and the marks of his claws upon my brother's face.  Did you mark the Indian by the Pelly trail, his mitten which had no thumb, his hand which he warmed by our fire?  He was my brother.  And I said he should have no grub.  And he went away in the Silence without grub.'  <br><br>""This, my brothers, was the love of Passuk, who died in the snow, by the Caribou Crossing.  It was a mighty love, for she denied her brother for the man who led her away on weary trails to a bitter end.  And, further, such was this woman's love, she denied herself.  Ere her eyes closed for the last time she took my hand and slipped it under her squirrel-skin parka to her waist.  I felt there a well-filled pouch, and learned the secret of her lost strength.  Day by day we had shared fair, to the last least bit; and day by day but half her share had she eaten.  The other half had gone into the well-filled pouch.   <br><br>""And she said:  'This is the end of the trail for Passuk; but your trail, Charley, leads on and on, over the great Chilcoot, down to Haines Mission and the sea.  And it leads on and on, by the light of many suns, over unknown lands and strange waters, and it is full of years and honors and great glories.  It leads you to the lodges of many women, and good women, but it will never lead you to a greater love than the love of Passuk.'  <br><br>""And I knew the woman spoke true.  But a madness came upon me, and I threw the well-filled pouch from me, and swore that my trail had reached an end, till her tired eyes grew soft with tears, and she said:  'Among men has Sitka Charley walked in honor, and ever has his word been true.  Does he forget that honor now, and talk vain words by the Caribou Crossing?  Does he remember no more the men of Forty Mile, who gave him of their grub the best, of their dogs the pick?  Ever has Passuk been proud of her man.  Let him lift himself up, gird on his snow-shoes, and begone, that she may still keep her pride.'   <br><br>""And when she grew cold in my arms I arose, and sought out the well-filled pouch, and girt on my snowshoes, and staggered along the trail; for there was a weakness in my knees, and my head was dizzy, and in my ears there was a roaring, and a flashing of fire upon my eyes.  The forgotten trails of boyhood came back to me.  I sat by the full pots of the potlach feast, and raised my voice in song, and danced to the chanting of the men and maidens and the booming of the walrus drums.  And Passuk held my hand and walked by my side.  When I laid down to sleep, she waked me.  When I stumbled and fell, she raised me.  When I wandered in the deep snow, she led me back to the trail.  And in this wise, like a man bereft of reason, who sees strange visions and whose thoughts are light with wine, I came to Haines Mission by the sea.""  <br><br>Sitka Charley threw back the tent-flaps.  It was midday.  To the south, just clearing the bleak Henderson Divide, poised the cold- disked sun.  On either hand the sun-dogs blazed.  The air was a gossamer of glittering frost.  In the foreground, beside the trail, a wolf-dog, bristling with frost, thrust a long snout heavenward and mourned.                                    <br><br>"
32,Holding Her Down,"Barring accidents, a good hobo, with youth and agility, can hold a train down despite all the efforts of the train-crew to ""ditch"" him--given, of course, night-time as an essential condition. When such a hobo, under such conditions, makes up his mind that he is going to hold her down, either he does hold her down, or chance trips him up. There is no legitimate way, short of murder, whereby the train-crew can ditch him. That train-crews have not stopped short of murder is a current belief in the tramp world. Not having had that particular experience in my tramp days I cannot vouch for it personally.<br><br>But this I have heard of the ""bad"" roads. When a tramp has ""gone underneath,"" on the rods, and the train is in motion, there is apparently no way of dislodging him until the train stops. The tramp, snugly ensconced inside the truck, with the four wheels and all the framework around him, has the ""cinch"" on the crew--or so he thinks, until some day he rides the rods on a bad road. A bad road is usually one on which a short time previously one or several trainmen have been killed by tramps. Heaven pity the tramp who is caught ""underneath"" on such a road--for caught he is, though the train be going sixty miles an hour.<br><br>The ""shack"" (brakeman) takes a coupling-pin and a length of bell-cord to the platform in front of the truck in which the tramp is riding. The shack fastens the coupling-pin to the bell-cord, drops the former down between the platforms, and pays out the latter. The coupling-pin strikes the ties between the rails, rebounds against the bottom of the car, and again strikes the ties. The shack plays it back and forth, now to this side, now to the other, lets it out a bit and hauls it in a bit, giving his weapon opportunity for every variety of impact and rebound. Every blow of that flying coupling-pin is freighted with death, and at sixty miles an hour it beats a veritable tattoo of death. The next day the remains of that tramp are gathered up along the right of way, and a line in the local paper mentions the unknown man, undoubtedly a tramp, assumably drunk, who had probably fallen asleep on the track.<br><br>As a characteristic illustration of how a capable hobo can hold her down, I am minded to give the following experience. I was in Ottawa, bound west over the Canadian Pacific. Three thousand miles of that road stretched before me; it was the fall of the year, and I had to cross Manitoba and the Rocky Mountains. I could expect ""crimpy"" weather, and every moment of delay increased the frigid hardships of the journey. Furthermore, I was disgusted. The distance between Montreal and Ottawa is one hundred and twenty miles. I ought to know, for I had just come over it and it had taken me six days. By mistake I had missed the main line and come over a small ""jerk"" with only two locals a day on it. And during these six days I had lived on dry crusts, and not enough of them, begged from the French peasants.<br><br>Furthermore, my disgust had been heightened by the one day I had spent in Ottawa trying to get an outfit of clothing for my long journey. Let me put it on record right here that Ottawa, with one exception, is the hardest town in the United States and Canada to beg clothes in; the one exception is Washington, D.C. The latter fair city is the limit. I spent two weeks there trying to beg a pair of shoes, and then had to go on to Jersey City before I got them.<br><br>But to return to Ottawa. At eight sharp in the morning I started out after clothes. I worked energetically all day. I swear I walked forty miles. I interviewed the housewives of a thousand homes. I did not even knock off work for dinner. And at six in the afternoon, after ten hours of unremitting and depressing toil, I was still shy one shirt, while the pair of trousers I had managed to acquire was tight and, moreover, was showing all the signs of an early disintegration.<br><br>At six I quit work and headed for the railroad yards, expecting to pick up something to eat on the way. But my hard luck was still with me. I was refused food at house after house. Then I got a ""hand-out."" My spirits soared, for it was the largest hand-out I had ever seen in a long and varied experience. It was a parcel wrapped in newspapers and as big as a mature suit-case. I hurried to a vacant lot and opened it. First, I saw cake, then more cake, all kinds and makes of cake, and then some. It was all cake. No bread and butter with thick firm slices of meat between--nothing but cake; and I who of all things abhorred cake most! In another age and clime they sat down by the waters of Babylon and wept. And in a vacant lot in Canada's proud capital, I, too, sat down and wept ... over a mountain of cake. As one looks upon the face of his dead son, so looked I upon that multitudinous pastry. I suppose I was an ungrateful tramp, for I refused to partake of the bounteousness of the house that had had a party the night before. Evidently the guests hadn't liked cake either.<br><br>That cake marked the crisis in my fortunes. Than it nothing could be worse; therefore things must begin to mend. And they did. At the very next house I was given a ""set-down."" Now a ""set-down"" is the height of bliss. One is taken inside, very often is given a chance to wash, and is then ""set-down"" at a table. Tramps love to throw their legs under a table. The house was large and comfortable, in the midst of spacious grounds and fine trees, and sat well back from the street. They had just finished eating, and I was taken right into the dining room--in itself a most unusual happening, for the tramp who is lucky enough to win a set-down usually receives it in the kitchen. A grizzled and gracious Englishman, his matronly wife, and a beautiful young Frenchwoman talked with me while I ate.<br><br>I wonder if that beautiful young Frenchwoman would remember, at this late day, the laugh I gave her when I uttered the barbaric phrase, ""two-bits."" You see, I was trying delicately to hit them for a ""light piece."" That was how the sum of money came to be mentioned. ""What?"" she said. ""Two-bits,"" said I. Her mouth was twitching as she again said, ""What?"" ""Two-bits,"" said I. Whereat she burst into laughter. ""Won't you repeat it?"" she said, when she had regained control of herself. ""Two-bits,"" said I. And once more she rippled into uncontrollable silvery laughter. ""I beg your pardon,"" said she; ""but what ... what was it you said?"" ""Two-bits,"" said I; ""is there anything wrong about it?"" ""Not that I know of,"" she gurgled between gasps; ""but what does it mean?"" I explained, but I do not remember now whether or not I got that two-bits out of her; but I have often wondered since as to which of us was the provincial.<br><br>When I arrived at the depot, I found, much to my disgust, a bunch of at least twenty tramps that were waiting to ride out the blind baggages of the overland. Now two or three tramps on the blind baggage are all right. They are inconspicuous. But a score! That meant trouble. No train-crew would ever let all of us ride.<br><br>I may as well explain here what a blind baggage is. Some mail-cars are built without doors in the ends; hence, such a car is ""blind."" The mail-cars that possess end doors, have those doors always locked. Suppose, after the train has started, that a tramp gets on to the platform of one of these blind cars. There is no door, or the door is locked. No conductor or brakeman can get to him to collect fare or throw him off. It is clear that the tramp is safe until the next time the train stops. Then he must get off, run ahead in the darkness, and when the train pulls by, jump on to the blind again. But there are ways and ways, as you shall see.<br><br>When the train pulled out, those twenty tramps swarmed upon the three blinds. Some climbed on before the train had run a car-length. They were awkward dubs, and I saw their speedy finish. Of course, the train-crew was ""on,"" and at the first stop the trouble began. I jumped off and ran forward along the track. I noticed that I was accompanied by a number of the tramps. They evidently knew their business. When one is beating an overland, he must always keep well ahead of the train at the stops. I ran ahead, and as I ran, one by one those that accompanied me dropped out. This dropping out was the measure of their skill and nerve in boarding a train.<br><br>For this is the way it works. When the train starts, the shack rides out the blind. There is no way for him to get back into the train proper except by jumping off the blind and catching a platform where the car-ends are not ""blind."" When the train is going as fast as the shack cares to risk, he therefore jumps off the blind, lets several cars go by, and gets on to the train. So it is up to the tramp to run so far ahead that before the blind is opposite him the shack will have already vacated it.<br><br>I dropped the last tramp by about fifty feet, and waited. The train started. I saw the lantern of the shack on the first blind. He was riding her out. And I saw the dubs stand forlornly by the track as the blind went by. They made no attempt to get on. They were beaten by their own inefficiency at the very start. After them, in the line-up, came the tramps that knew a little something about the game. They let the first blind, occupied by the shack, go by, and jumped on the second and third blinds. Of course, the shack jumped off the first and on to the second as it went by, and scrambled around there, throwing off the men who had boarded it. But the point is that I was so far ahead that when the first blind came opposite me, the shack had already left it and was tangled up with the tramps on the second blind. A half dozen of the more skilful tramps, who had run far enough ahead, made the first blind, too.<br><br>At the next stop, as we ran forward along the track, I counted but fifteen of us. Five had been ditched. The weeding-out process had begun nobly, and it continued station by station. Now we were fourteen, now twelve, now eleven, now nine, now eight. It reminded me of the ten little niggers of the nursery rhyme. I was resolved that I should be the last little nigger of all. And why not? Was I not blessed with strength, agility, and youth? (I was eighteen, and in perfect condition.) And didn't I have my ""nerve"" with me? And furthermore, was I not a tramp-royal? Were not these other tramps mere dubs and ""gay-cats"" and amateurs alongside of me? If I weren't the last little nigger, I might as well quit the game and get a job on an alfalfa farm somewhere.<br><br>By the time our number had been reduced to four, the whole train-crew had become interested. From then on it was a contest of skill and wits, with the odds in favor of the crew. One by one the three other survivors turned up missing, until I alone remained. My, but I was proud of myself! No Croesus was ever prouder of his first million. I was holding her down in spite of two brakemen, a conductor, a fireman, and an engineer.<br><br>And here are a few samples of the way I held her down. Out ahead, in the darkness,--so far ahead that the shack riding out the blind must perforce get off before it reaches me,--I get on. Very well. I am good for another station. When that station is reached, I dart ahead again to repeat the manoeuvre. The train pulls out. I watch her coming. There is no light of a lantern on the blind. Has the crew abandoned the fight? I do not know. One never knows, and one must be prepared every moment for anything. As the first blind comes opposite me, and I run to leap aboard, I strain my eyes to see if the shack is on the platform. For all I know he may be there, with his lantern doused, and even as I spring upon the steps that lantern may smash down upon my head. I ought to know. I have been hit by lanterns two or three times.<br><br>But no, the first blind is empty. The train is gathering speed. I am safe for another station. But am I? I feel the train slacken speed. On the instant I am alert. A manoeuvre is being executed against me, and I do not know what it is. I try to watch on both sides at once, not forgetting to keep track of the tender in front of me. From any one, or all, of these three directions, I may be assailed.<br><br>Ah, there it comes. The shack has ridden out the engine. My first warning is when his feet strike the steps of the right-hand side of the blind. Like a flash I am off the blind to the left and running ahead past the engine. I lose myself in the darkness. The situation is where it has been ever since the train left Ottawa. I am ahead, and the train must come past me if it is to proceed on its journey. I have as good a chance as ever for boarding her.<br><br>I watch carefully. I see a lantern come forward to the engine, and I do not see it go back from the engine. It must therefore be still on the engine, and it is a fair assumption that attached to the handle of that lantern is a shack. That shack was lazy, or else he would have put out his lantern instead of trying to shield it as he came forward. The train pulls out. The first blind is empty, and I gain it. As before the train slackens, the shack from the engine boards the blind from one side, and I go off the other side and run forward.<br><br>As I wait in the darkness I am conscious of a big thrill of pride. The overland has stopped twice for me--for me, a poor hobo on the bum. I alone have twice stopped the overland with its many passengers and coaches, its government mail, and its two thousand steam horses straining in the engine. And I weigh only one hundred and sixty pounds, and I haven't a five-cent piece in my pocket!<br><br>Again I see the lantern come forward to the engine. But this time it comes conspicuously. A bit too conspicuously to suit me, and I wonder what is up. At any rate I have something else to be afraid of than the shack on the engine. The train pulls by. Just in time, before I make my spring, I see the dark form of a shack, without a lantern, on the first blind. I let it go by, and prepare to board the second blind. But the shack on the first blind has jumped off and is at my heels. Also, I have a fleeting glimpse of the lantern of the shack who rode out the engine. He has jumped off, and now both shacks are on the ground on the same side with me. The next moment the second blind comes by and I am aboard it. But I do not linger. I have figured out my countermove. As I dash across the platform I hear the impact of the shack's feet against the steps as he boards. I jump off the other side and run forward with the train. My plan is to run forward and get on the first blind. It is nip and tuck, for the train is gathering speed. Also, the shack is behind me and running after me. I guess I am the better sprinter, for I make the first blind. I stand on the steps and watch my pursuer. He is only about ten feet back and running hard; but now the train has approximated his own speed, and, relative to me, he is standing still. I encourage him, hold out my hand to him; but he explodes in a mighty oath, gives up and makes the train several cars back.<br><br>The train is speeding along, and I am still chuckling to myself, when, without warning, a spray of water strikes me. The fireman is playing the hose on me from the engine. I step forward from the car-platform to the rear of the tender, where I am sheltered under the overhang. The water flies harmlessly over my head. My fingers itch to climb up on the tender and lam that fireman with a chunk of coal; but I know if I do that, I'll be massacred by him and the engineer, and I refrain.<br><br>At the next stop I am off and ahead in the darkness. This time, when the train pulls out, both shacks are on the first blind. I divine their game. They have blocked the repetition of my previous play. I cannot again take the second blind, cross over, and run forward to the first. As soon as the first blind passes and I do not get on, they swing off, one on each side of the train. I board the second blind, and as I do so I know that a moment later, simultaneously, those two shacks will arrive on both sides of me. It is like a trap. Both ways are blocked. Yet there is another way out, and that way is up.<br><br>So I do not wait for my pursuers to arrive. I climb upon the upright ironwork of the platform and stand upon the wheel of the hand-brake. This has taken up the moment of grace and I hear the shacks strike the steps on either side. I don't stop to look. I raise my arms overhead until my hands rest against the down-curving ends of the roofs of the two cars. One hand, of course, is on the curved roof of one car, the other hand on the curved roof of the other car. By this time both shacks are coming up the steps. I know it, though I am too busy to see them. All this is happening in the space of only several seconds. I make a spring with my legs and ""muscle"" myself up with my arms. As I draw up my legs, both shacks reach for me and clutch empty air. I know this, for I look down and see them. Also I hear them swear.<br><br>I am now in a precarious position, riding the ends of the down-curving roofs of two cars at the same time. With a quick, tense movement, I transfer both legs to the curve of one roof and both hands to the curve of the other roof. Then, gripping the edge of that curving roof, I climb over the curve to the level roof above, where I sit down to catch my breath, holding on the while to a ventilator that projects above the surface. I am on top of the train--on the ""decks,"" as the tramps call it, and this process I have described is by them called ""decking her."" And let me say right here that only a young and vigorous tramp is able to deck a passenger train, and also, that the young and vigorous tramp must have his nerve with him as well.<br><br>The train goes on gathering speed, and I know I am safe until the next stop--but only until the next stop. If I remain on the roof after the train stops, I know those shacks will fusillade me with rocks. A healthy shack can ""dewdrop"" a pretty heavy chunk of stone on top of a car--say anywhere from five to twenty pounds. On the other hand, the chances are large that at the next stop the shacks will be waiting for me to descend at the place I climbed up. It is up to me to climb down at some other platform.<br><br>Registering a fervent hope that there are no tunnels in the next half mile, I rise to my feet and walk down the train half a dozen cars. And let me say that one must leave timidity behind him on such a <i>passear</i>. The roofs of passenger coaches are not made for midnight promenades. And if any one thinks they are, let me advise him to try it. Just let him walk along the roof of a jolting, lurching car, with nothing to hold on to but the black and empty air, and when he comes to the down-curving end of the roof, all wet and slippery with dew, let him accelerate his speed so as to step across to the next roof, down-curving and wet and slippery. Believe me, he will learn whether his heart is weak or his head is giddy.<br><br>As the train slows down for a stop, half a dozen platforms from where I had decked her I come down. No one is on the platform. When the train comes to a standstill, I slip off to the ground. Ahead, and between me and the engine, are two moving lanterns. The shacks are looking for me on the roofs of the cars. I note that the car beside which I am standing is a ""four-wheeler""--by which is meant that it has only four wheels to each truck. (When you go underneath on the rods, be sure to avoid the ""six-wheelers,""--they lead to disasters.)<br><br>I duck under the train and make for the rods, and I can tell you I am mighty glad that the train is standing still. It is the first time I have ever gone underneath on the Canadian Pacific, and the internal arrangements are new to me. I try to crawl over the top of the truck, between the truck and the bottom of the car. But the space is not large enough for me to squeeze through. This is new to me. Down in the United States I am accustomed to going underneath on rapidly moving trains, seizing a gunnel and swinging my feet under to the brake-beam, and from there crawling over the top of the truck and down inside the truck to a seat on the cross-rod.<br><br>Feeling with my hands in the darkness, I learn that there is room between the brake-beam and the ground. It is a tight squeeze. I have to lie flat and worm my way through. Once inside the truck, I take my seat on the rod and wonder what the shacks are thinking has become of me. The train gets under way. They have given me up at last.<br><br>But have they? At the very next stop, I see a lantern thrust under the next truck to mine at the other end of the car. They are searching the rods for me. I must make my get-away pretty lively. I crawl on my stomach under the brake-beam. They see me and run for me, but I crawl on hands and knees across the rail on the opposite side and gain my feet. Then away I go for the head of the train. I run past the engine and hide in the sheltering darkness. It is the same old situation. I am ahead of the train, and the train must go past me.<br><br>The train pulls out. There is a lantern on the first blind. I lie low, and see the peering shack go by. But there is also a lantern on the second blind. That shack spots me and calls to the shack who has gone past on the first blind. Both jump off. Never mind, I'll take the third blind and deck her. But heavens, there is a lantern on the third blind, too. It is the conductor. I let it go by. At any rate I have now the full train-crew in front of me. I turn and run back in the opposite direction to what the train is going. I look over my shoulder. All three lanterns are on the ground and wobbling along in pursuit. I sprint. Half the train has gone by, and it is going quite fast, when I spring aboard. I know that the two shacks and the conductor will arrive like ravening wolves in about two seconds. I spring upon the wheel of the hand-brake, get my hands on the curved ends of the roofs, and muscle myself up to the decks; while my disappointed pursuers, clustering on the platform beneath like dogs that have treed a cat, howl curses up at me and say unsocial things about my ancestors.<br><br>But what does that matter? It is five to one, including the engineer and fireman, and the majesty of the law and the might of a great corporation are behind them, and I am beating them out. I am too far down the train, and I run ahead over the roofs of the coaches until I am over the fifth or sixth platform from the engine. I peer down cautiously. A shack is on that platform. That he has caught sight of me, I know from the way he makes a swift sneak inside the car; and I know, also, that he is waiting inside the door, all ready to pounce out on me when I climb down. But I make believe that I don't know, and I remain there to encourage him in his error. I do not see him, yet I know that he opens the door once and peeps up to assure himself that I am still there.<br><br>The train slows down for a station. I dangle my legs down in a tentative way. The train stops. My legs are still dangling. I hear the door unlatch softly. He is all ready for me. Suddenly I spring up and run forward over the roof. This is right over his head, where he lurks inside the door. The train is standing still; the night is quiet, and I take care to make plenty of noise on the metal roof with my feet. I don't know, but my assumption is that he is now running forward to catch me as I descend at the next platform. But I don't descend there. Halfway along the roof of the coach, I turn, retrace my way softly and quickly to the platform both the shack and I have just abandoned. The coast is clear. I descend to the ground on the off-side of the train and hide in the darkness. Not a soul has seen me.<br><br>I go over to the fence, at the edge of the right of way, and watch. Ah, ha! What's that? I see a lantern on top of the train, moving along from front to rear. They think I haven't come down, and they are searching the roofs for me. And better than that--on the ground on each side of the train, moving abreast with the lantern on top, are two other lanterns. It is a rabbit-drive, and I am the rabbit. When the shack on top flushes me, the ones on each side will nab me. I roll a cigarette and watch the procession go by. Once past me, I am safe to proceed to the front of the train. She pulls out, and I make the front blind without opposition. But before she is fully under way and just as I am lighting my cigarette, I am aware that the fireman has climbed over the coal to the back of the tender and is looking down at me. I am filled with apprehension. From his position he can mash me to a jelly with lumps of coal. Instead of which he addresses me, and I note with relief the admiration in his voice.<br><br>""You son-of-a-gun,"" is what he says.<br><br>It is a high compliment, and I thrill as a schoolboy thrills on receiving a reward of merit.<br><br>""Say,"" I call up to him, ""don't you play the hose on me any more.""<br><br>""All right,"" he answers, and goes back to his work.<br><br>I have made friends with the engine, but the shacks are still looking for me. At the next stop, the shacks ride out all three blinds, and as before, I let them go by and deck in the middle of the train. The crew is on its mettle by now, and the train stops. The shacks are going to ditch me or know the reason why. Three times the mighty overland stops for me at that station, and each time I elude the shacks and make the decks. But it is hopeless, for they have finally come to an understanding of the situation. I have taught them that they cannot guard the train from me. They must do something else.<br><br>And they do it. When the train stops that last time, they take after me hot-footed. Ah, I see their game. They are trying to run me down. At first they herd me back toward the rear of the train. I know my peril. Once to the rear of the train, it will pull out with me left behind. I double, and twist, and turn, dodge through my pursuers, and gain the front of the train. One shack still hangs on after me. All right, I'll give him the run of his life, for my wind is good. I run straight ahead along the track. It doesn't matter. If he chases me ten miles, he'll nevertheless have to catch the train, and I can board her at any speed that he can.<br><br>So I run on, keeping just comfortably ahead of him and straining my eyes in the gloom for cattle-guards and switches that may bring me to grief. Alas! I strain my eyes too far ahead, and trip over something just under my feet, I know not what, some little thing, and go down to earth in a long, stumbling fall. The next moment I am on my feet, but the shack has me by the collar. I do not struggle. I am busy with breathing deeply and with sizing him up. He is narrow-shouldered, and I have at least thirty pounds the better of him in weight. Besides, he is just as tired as I am, and if he tries to slug me, I'll teach him a few things.<br><br>But he doesn't try to slug me, and that problem is settled. Instead, he starts to lead me back toward the train, and another possible problem arises. I see the lanterns of the conductor and the other shack. We are approaching them. Not for nothing have I made the acquaintance of the New York police. Not for nothing, in box-cars, by water-tanks, and in prison-cells, have I listened to bloody tales of man-handling. What if these three men are about to man-handle me? Heaven knows I have given them provocation enough. I think quickly. We are drawing nearer and nearer to the other two trainmen. I line up the stomach and the jaw of my captor, and plan the right and left I'll give him at the first sign of trouble.<br><br>Pshaw! I know another trick I'd like to work on him, and I almost regret that I did not do it at the moment I was captured. I could make him sick, what of his clutch on my collar. His fingers, tight-gripping, are buried inside my collar. My coat is tightly buttoned. Did you ever see a tourniquet? Well, this is one. All I have to do is to duck my head under his arm and begin to twist. I must twist rapidly--very rapidly. I know how to do it; twisting in a violent, jerky way, ducking my head under his arm with each revolution. Before he knows it, those detaining fingers of his will be detained. He will be unable to withdraw them. It is a powerful leverage. Twenty seconds after I have started revolving, the blood will be bursting out of his finger-ends, the delicate tendons will be rupturing, and all the muscles and nerves will be mashing and crushing together in a shrieking mass. Try it sometime when somebody has you by the collar. But be quick--quick as lightning. Also, be sure to hug yourself while you are revolving--hug your face with your left arm and your abdomen with your right. You see, the other fellow might try to stop you with a punch from his free arm. It would be a good idea, too, to revolve away from that free arm rather than toward it. A punch going is never so bad as a punch coming.<br><br>That shack will never know how near he was to being made very, very sick. All that saves him is that it is not in their plan to man-handle me. When we draw near enough, he calls out that he has me, and they signal the train to come on. The engine passes us, and the three blinds. After that, the conductor and the other shack swing aboard. But still my captor holds on to me. I see the plan. He is going to hold me until the rear of the train goes by. Then he will hop on, and I shall be left behind--ditched.<br><br>But the train has pulled out fast, the engineer trying to make up for lost time. Also, it is a long train. It is going very lively, and I know the shack is measuring its speed with apprehension.<br><br>""Think you can make it?"" I query innocently.<br><br>He releases my collar, makes a quick run, and swings aboard. A number of coaches are yet to pass by. He knows it, and remains on the steps, his head poked out and watching me. In that moment my next move comes to me. I'll make the last platform. I know she's going fast and faster, but I'll only get a roll in the dirt if I fail, and the optimism of youth is mine. I do not give myself away. I stand with a dejected droop of shoulder, advertising that I have abandoned hope. But at the same time I am feeling with my feet the good gravel. It is perfect footing. Also I am watching the poked-out head of the shack. I see it withdrawn. He is confident that the train is going too fast for me ever to make it.<br><br>And the train <i>is</i> going fast--faster than any train I have ever tackled. As the last coach comes by I sprint in the same direction with it. It is a swift, short sprint. I cannot hope to equal the speed of the train, but I can reduce the difference of our speed to the minimum, and, hence, reduce the shock of impact, when I leap on board. In the fleeting instant of darkness I do not see the iron hand-rail of the last platform; nor is there time for me to locate it. I reach for where I think it ought to be, and at the same instant my feet leave the ground. It is all in the toss. The next moment I may be rolling in the gravel with broken ribs, or arms, or head. But my fingers grip the hand-hold, there is a jerk on my arms that slightly pivots my body, and my feet land on the steps with sharp violence.<br><br>I sit down, feeling very proud of myself. In all my hoboing it is the best bit of train-jumping I have done. I know that late at night one is always good for several stations on the last platform, but I do not care to trust myself at the rear of the train. At the first stop I run forward on the off-side of the train, pass the Pullmans, and duck under and take a rod under a day-coach. At the next stop I run forward again and take another rod.<br><br>I am now comparatively safe. The shacks think I am ditched. But the long day and the strenuous night are beginning to tell on me. Also, it is not so windy nor cold underneath, and I begin to doze. This will never do. Sleep on the rods spells death, so I crawl out at a station and go forward to the second blind. Here I can lie down and sleep; and here I do sleep--how long I do not know--for I am awakened by a lantern thrust into my face. The two shacks are staring at me. I scramble up on the defensive, wondering as to which one is going to make the first ""pass"" at me. But slugging is far from their minds.<br><br>""I thought you was ditched,"" says the shack who had held me by the collar.<br><br>""If you hadn't let go of me when you did, you'd have been ditched along with me,"" I answer.<br><br>""How's that?"" he asks.<br><br>""I'd have gone into a clinch with you, that's all,"" is my reply.<br><br>They hold a consultation, and their verdict is summed up in:--<br><br>""Well, I guess you can ride, Bo. There's no use trying to keep you off.""<br><br>And they go away and leave me in peace to the end of their division.<br><br>I have given the foregoing as a sample of what ""holding her down"" means. Of course, I have selected a fortunate night out of my experiences, and said nothing of the nights--and many of them--when I was tripped up by accident and ditched.<br><br>In conclusion, I want to tell of what happened when I reached the end of the division. On single-track, transcontinental lines, the freight trains wait at the divisions and follow out after the passenger trains. When the division was reached, I left my train, and looked for the freight that would pull out behind it. I found the freight, made up on a side-track and waiting. I climbed into a box-car half full of coal and lay down. In no time I was asleep.<br><br>I was awakened by the sliding open of the door. Day was just dawning, cold and gray, and the freight had not yet started. A ""con"" (conductor) was poking his head inside the door.<br><br>""Get out of that, you blankety-blank-blank!"" he roared at me.<br><br>I got, and outside I watched him go down the line inspecting every car in the train. When he got out of sight I thought to myself that he would never think I'd have the nerve to climb back into the very car out of which he had fired me. So back I climbed and lay down again.<br><br>Now that con's mental processes must have been paralleling, mine, for he reasoned that it was the very thing I would do. For back he came and fired me out.<br><br>Now, surely, I reasoned, he will never dream that I'd do it a third time. Back I went, into the very same car. But I decided to make sure. Only one side-door could be opened. The other side-door was nailed up. Beginning at the top of the coal, I dug a hole alongside of that door and lay down in it. I heard the other door open. The con climbed up and looked in over the top of the coal. He couldn't see me. He called to me to get out. I tried to fool him by remaining quiet. But when he began tossing chunks of coal into the hole on top of me, I gave up and for the third time was fired out. Also, he informed me in warm terms of what would happen to me if he caught me in there again.<br><br>I changed my tactics. When a man is paralleling your mental processes, ditch him. Abruptly break off your line of reasoning, and go off on a new line. This I did. I hid between some cars on an adjacent side-track, and watched. Sure enough, that con came back again to the car. He opened the door, he climbed up, he called, he threw coal into the hole I had made. He even crawled over the coal and looked into the hole. That satisfied him. Five minutes later the freight was pulling out, and he was not in sight. I ran alongside the car, pulled the door open, and climbed in. He never looked for me again, and I rode that coal-car precisely one thousand and twenty-two miles, sleeping most of the time and getting out at divisions (where the freights always stop for an hour or so) to beg my food. And at the end of the thousand and twenty-two miles I lost that car through a happy incident. I got a ""set-down,"" and the tramp doesn't live who won't miss a train for a set-down any time.<br><br>"
33,"Jack London, by Himself","I was born in San Francisco in 1876. At fifteen I was a man among men, and if I had a spare nickel I spent it on beer instead of candy, because I thought it was more manly to buy beer. Now, when my years are nearly doubled, I am out on a hunt for the boyhood which I never had, and I am less serious than at any other time of my life. Guess I'll find that boyhood! Almost the first things I realized were responsibilities. I have no recollection of being taught to read or write--I could do both at the age of five--but I know that my first school was in Alameda before I went out on a ranch with my folks and as a ranch boy worked hard from my eighth year.<br><br>The second school were I tried to pick up a little learning was an irregular hit or miss affair at San Mateo. Each class sat in a separate desk, but there were days when we did not sit at all, for the master used to get drunk very often, and then one of the elder boys would thrash him. To even things up, the master would then thrash the younger lads, so you can think what sort of school it was. There was no one belonging to me, or associated with me in any way, who had literary tastes or ideas, the nearest I can make to it is that my great-grandfather was a circuit writer, a Welshman, known as ""Priest"" Jones in the backwoods, where his enthusiasm led him to scatter the Gospel.<br><br>One of my earliest and strongest impressions was of the ignorance of other people. I had read and absorbed Washington Irving's ""Alhambra"" before I was nine, but could never understand how it was that the other ranchers knew nothing about it. Later I concluded that this ignorance was peculiar to the country, and felt that those who lived in cities would not be so dense. One day a man from the city came to the ranch. He wore shiny shoes and a cloth coat, and I felt that here was a good chance for me to exchange thoughts with an enlightened mind. From the bricks of an old fallen chimney I had built an Alhambra of my own; towers, terraces, and all were complete, and chalk inscriptions marked the different sections. Here I led the city man and questioned him about ""The Alhambra,"" but he was as ignorant as the man on the ranch, and then I consoled myself with the thought that there were only two clever people in the world--Washington Irving and myself.<br><br>My other reading-matter at that time consisted mainly of dime novels, borrowed from the hired men, and newspapers in which the servants gloated over the adventures of poor but virtuous shop-girls.<br><br>Through reading such stuff my mind was necessarily ridiculously conventional, but being very lonely I read everything that came my way, and was greatly impressed by Ouida's story ""Signa,"" which I devoured regularly for a couple of years. I never knew the finish until I grew up, for the closing chapters were missing from my copy, so I kept on dreaming with the hero, and, like him, unable to see Nemesis, at the end. My work on the ranch at one time was to watch the bees, and as I sat under a tree from sunrise till late in the afternoon, waiting for the swarming, I had plenty of time to read and dream. Livermore Valley was very flat, and even the hills around were then to me devoid of interest, and the only incident to break in on my visions was when I gave the alarm of swarming, and the ranch folks rushed out with pots, pans, and buckets of water. I think the opening line of ""Signa"" was ""It was only a little lad,"" yet he had dreams of becoming a great musician, and having all Europe at his feet. Well, I was only a little lad, too, but why could not I become what ""Signa"" dreamed of being?<br><br>Life on a Californian ranch was then to me the dullest possible existence, and every day I thought of going out beyond the sky-line to see the world. Even then there were whispers, promptings; my mind inclined to things beautiful, although my environment was unbeautiful. The hills and valleys around were eyesores and aching pits, and I never loved them till I left them.<br><br>&#160;* * * * *<br><br>Before I was eleven I left the ranch and came to Oakland, where I spent so much of my time in the Free Public Library, eagerly reading everything that came to hand, that I developed the first stages of St. Vitus' dance from lack of exercise. Disillusions quickly followed, as I learned more of the world. At this time I made my living as a newsboy, selling papers in the streets; and from then on until I was sixteen I had a thousand and one different occupations--work and school, school and work--and so it ran.<br><br>Then the adventure-lust was strong within me, and I left home. I didn't run, I just left--went out in the bay, and joined the oyster pirates. The days of the oyster pirates are now past, and if I had got my dues for piracy, I would have been given five hundred years in prison. Later, I shipped as a sailor on a schooner, and also took a turn at salmon fishing. Oddly enough, my next occupation was on a fish-patrol, where I was entrusted with the arrest of any violators of the fishing laws. Numbers of lawless Chinese, Greeks, and Italians were at that time engaged in illegal fishing, and many a patrolman paid his life for his interference. My only weapon on duty was a steel table-fork, but I felt fearless and a man when I climbed over the side of a boat to arrest some marauder.<br><br>Subsequently I shipped before the mast and sailed for the Japanese coast on a seal-hunting expedition, later going to Behring Sea. After sealing for seven months I came back to California and took odd jobs at coal shovelling and longshoring and also in a jute factory, where I worked from six in the morning until seven at night. I had planned to join the same lot for another sealing trip the following year, but somehow I missed them. They sailed away on the <i>Mary Thomas</i>, which was lost with all hands.<br><br>In my fitful school-days I had written the usual compositions, which had been praised in the usual way, and while working in the jute mills I still made an occasional try. The factory occupied thirteen hours of my day, and being young and husky, I wanted a little time for myself, so there was little left for composition. The San Francisco <i>Call</i> offered a prize for a descriptive article. My mother urged me to try for it, and I did, taking for my subject ""Typhoon off the Coast of Japan."" Very tired and sleepy, knowing I had to be up at half-past five, I began the article at midnight and worked straight on until I had written two thousand words, the limit of the article, but with my idea only half worked out. The next night, under the same conditions, I continued, adding another two thousand words before I finished, and then the third night I spent in cutting out the excess, so as to bring the article within the conditions of the contest. The first prize came to me, and the second and third went to students of the Stanford and Berkeley Universities.<br><br>My success in the San Francisco <i>Call</i> competition seriously turned my thoughts to writing, but my blood was still too hot for a settled routine, so I practically deferred literature, beyond writing a little gush for the <i>Call</i>, which that journal promptly rejected.<br><br>I tramped all through the United States, from California to Boston, and up and down, returning to the Pacific coast by way of Canada, where I got into jail and served a term for vagrancy, and the whole tramping experience made me become a Socialist. Previously I had been impressed by the dignity of labour, and, without having read Carlyle or Kipling, I had formulated a gospel of work which put theirs in the shade. Work was everything. It was sanctification and salvation. The pride I took in a hard day's work well done would be inconceivable to you. I was as faithful a wage-slave as ever a capitalist exploited. In short, my joyous individualism was dominated by the orthodox bourgeois ethics. I had fought my way from the open west, where men bucked big and the job hunted the man, to the congested labour centres of the eastern states, where men were small potatoes and hunted the job for all they were worth, and I found myself looking upon life from a new and totally different angle. I saw the workers in the shambles at the bottom of the Social Pit. I swore I would never again do a hard day's work with my body except where absolutely compelled to, and I have been busy ever since running away from hard bodily labour.<br><br>In my nineteenth year I returned to Oakland and started at the High School, which ran the usual school magazine. This publication was a weekly--no, I guess a monthly--one, and I wrote stories for it, very little imaginary, just recitals of my sea and tramping experiences. I remained there a year, doing janitor work as a means of livelihood, and leaving eventually because the strain was more than I could bear. At this time my socialistic utterances had attracted considerable attention, and I was known as the ""Boy Socialist,"" a distinction that brought about my arrest for street-talking. After leaving the High School, in three months cramming by myself, I took the three years' work for that time and entered the University of California. I hated to give up the hope of a University education and worked in a laundry and with my pen to help me keep on. This was the only time I worked because I loved it, but the task was too much, and when half-way through my Freshman year I had to quit.<br><br>I worked away ironing shirts and other things in the laundry, and wrote in all my spare time. I tried to keep on at both, but often fell asleep with the pen in my hand. Then I left the laundry and wrote all the time, and lived and dreamed again. After three months' trial I gave up writing, having decided that I was a failure, and left for the Klondike to prospect for gold. At the end of the year, owing to the outbreak of scurvy, I was compelled to come out, and on the homeward journey of 1,900 miles in an open boat made the only notes of the trip. It was in the Klondike I found myself. There nobody talks. Everybody thinks. You get your true perspective. I got mine.<br><br>While I was in the Klondike my father died, and the burden of the family fell on my shoulders. Times were bad in California, and I could get no work. While trying for it I wrote ""Down the River,"" which was rejected. During the wait for this rejection I wrote a twenty-thousand word serial for a news company, which was also rejected. Pending each rejection I still kept on writing fresh stuff. I did not know what an editor looked like. I did not know a soul who had ever published anything. Finally a story was accepted by a Californian magazine, for which I received five dollars. Soon afterwards ""The Black Cat"" offered me forty dollars for a story.<br><br>Then things took a turn, and I shall probably not have to shovel coal for a living for some time to come, although I have done it, and could do it again.<br><br>My first book was published in 1900. I could have made a good deal at newspaper work; but I had sufficient sense to refuse to be a slave to that man-killing machine, for such I held a newspaper to be to a young man in his forming period. Not until I was well on my feet as a magazine- writer did I do much work for newspapers. I am a believer in regular work, and never wait for an inspiration. Temperamentally I am not only careless and irregular, but melancholy; still I have fought both down. The discipline I had as a sailor had full effect on me. Perhaps my old sea days are also responsible for the regularity and limitations of my sleep. Five and a half hours is the precise average I allow myself, and no circumstance has yet arisen in my life that could keep me awake when the time comes to ""turn in.""<br><br>I am very fond of sport, and delight in boxing, fencing, swimming, riding, yachting, and even kite-flying. Although primarily of the city, I like to be near it rather than in it. The country, though, is the best, the only natural life. In my grown-up years the writers who have influenced me most are Karl Marx in a particular, and Spencer in a general, way. In the days of my barren boyhood, if I had had a chance, I would have gone in for music; now, in what are more genuinely the days of my youth, if I had a million or two I would devote myself to writing poetry and pamphlets. I think the best work I have done is in the ""League of the Old Men,"" and parts of ""The Kempton-Wace Letters."" Other people don't like the former. They prefer brighter and more cheerful things. Perhaps I shall feel like that, too, when the days of my youth are behind me.<br><br>"
34,Lost Face,"It was the end.  Subienkow had travelled a long trail of bitterness and horror, homing like a dove for the capitals of Europe, and here, farther away than ever, in Russian America, the trail ceased.  He sat in the snow, arms tied behind him, waiting the torture.  He stared curiously before him at a huge Cossack, prone in the snow, moaning in his pain.  The men had finished handling the giant and turned him over to the women.  That they exceeded the fiendishness of the men, the man's cries attested.   <br><br>Subienkow looked on, and shuddered.  He was not afraid to die.  He had carried his life too long in his hands, on that weary trail from Warsaw to Nulato, to shudder at mere dying.  But he objected to the torture.  It offended his soul.  And this offence, in turn, was not due to the mere pain he must endure, but to the sorry spectacle the pain would make of him.  He knew that he would pray, and beg, and entreat, even as Big Ivan and the others that had gone before.  This would not be nice.  To pass out bravely and cleanly, with a smile and a jest--ah! that would have been the way.  But to lose control, to have his soul upset by the pangs of the flesh, to screech and gibber like an ape, to become the veriest beast--ah, that was what was so terrible.  <br><br>There had been no chance to escape.  From the beginning, when he dreamed the fiery dream of Poland's independence, he had become a puppet in the hands of Fate.  From the beginning, at Warsaw, at St. Petersburg, in the Siberian mines, in Kamtchatka, on the crazy boats of the fur-thieves, Fate had been driving him to this end.  Without doubt, in the foundations of the world was graved this end for him-- for him, who was so fine and sensitive, whose nerves scarcely sheltered under his skin, who was a dreamer, and a poet, and an artist.  Before he was dreamed of, it had been determined that the quivering bundle of sensitiveness that constituted him should be doomed to live in raw and howling savagery, and to die in this far land of night, in this dark place beyond the last boundaries of the world.   <br><br>He sighed.  So that thing before him was Big Ivan--Big Ivan the giant, the man without nerves, the man of iron, the Cossack turned freebooter of the seas, who was as phlegmatic as an ox, with a nervous system so low that what was pain to ordinary men was scarcely a tickle to him.  Well, well, trust these Nulato Indians to find Big Ivan's nerves and trace them to the roots of his quivering soul. They were certainly doing it.  It was inconceivable that a man could suffer so much and yet live.  Big Ivan was paying for his low order of nerves.  Already he had lasted twice as long as any of the others.  <br><br>Subienkow felt that he could not stand the Cossack's sufferings much longer.  Why didn't Ivan die?  He would go mad if that screaming did not cease.  But when it did cease, his turn would come.  And there was Yakaga awaiting him, too, grinning at him even now in anticipation--Yakaga, whom only last week he had kicked out of the fort, and upon whose face he had laid the lash of his dog-whip. Yakaga would attend to him.  Doubtlessly Yakaga was saving for him more refined tortures, more exquisite nerve-racking.  Ah! that must have been a good one, from the way Ivan screamed.  The squaws bending over him stepped back with laughter and clapping of hands.  Subienkow saw the monstrous thing that had been perpetrated, and began to laugh hysterically.  The Indians looked at him in wonderment that he should laugh.  But Subienkow could not stop.   <br><br>This would never do.  He controlled himself, the spasmodic twitchings slowly dying away.  He strove to think of other things, and began reading back in his own life.  He remembered his mother and his father, and the little spotted pony, and the French tutor who had taught him dancing and sneaked him an old worn copy of Voltaire. Once more he saw Paris, and dreary London, and gay Vienna, and Rome. And once more he saw that wild group of youths who had dreamed, even as he, the dream of an independent Poland with a king of Poland on the throne at Warsaw.  Ah, there it was that the long trail began. Well, he had lasted longest.  One by one, beginning with the two executed at St. Petersburg, he took up the count of the passing of those brave spirits.  Here one had been beaten to death by a jailer, and there, on that bloodstained highway of the exiles, where they had marched for endless months, beaten and maltreated by their Cossack guards, another had dropped by the way.  Always it had been savagery- -brutal, bestial savagery.  They had died--of fever, in the mines, under the knout.  The last two had died after the escape, in the battle with the Cossacks, and he alone had won to Kamtchatka with the stolen papers and the money of a traveller he had left lying in the snow.  <br><br>It had been nothing but savagery.  All the years, with his heart in studios, and theatres, and courts, he had been hemmed in by savagery. He had purchased his life with blood.  Everybody had killed.  He had killed that traveller for his passports.  He had proved that he was a man of parts by duelling with two Russian officers on a single day. He had had to prove himself in order to win to a place among the fur- thieves.  He had had to win to that place.  Behind him lay the thousand-years-long road across all Siberia and Russia.  He could not escape that way.  The only way was ahead, across the dark and icy sea of Bering to Alaska.  The way had led from savagery to deeper savagery.  On the scurvy-rotten ships of the fur-thieves, out of food and out of water, buffeted by the interminable storms of that stormy sea, men had become animals.  Thrice he had sailed east from Kamtchatka.  And thrice, after all manner of hardship and suffering, the survivors had come back to Kamtchatka.  There had been no outlet for escape, and he could not go back the way he had come, for the mines and the knout awaited him.   <br><br>Again, the fourth and last time, he had sailed east.  He had been with those who first found the fabled Seal Islands; but he had not returned with them to share the wealth of furs in the mad orgies of Kamtchatka.  He had sworn never to go back.  He knew that to win to those dear capitals of Europe he must go on.  So he had changed ships and remained in the dark new land.  His comrades were Slavonian hunters and Russian adventurers, Mongols and Tartars and Siberian aborigines; and through the savages of the new world they had cut a path of blood.  They had massacred whole villages that refused to furnish the fur-tribute; and they, in turn, had been massacred by ships' companies.  He, with one Finn, had been the sole survivor of such a company.  They had spent a winter of solitude and starvation on a lonely Aleutian isle, and their rescue in the spring by another fur-ship had been one chance in a thousand.  <br><br>But always the terrible savagery had hemmed him in.  Passing from ship to ship, and ever refusing to return, he had come to the ship that explored south.  All down the Alaska coast they had encountered nothing but hosts of savages.  Every anchorage among the beetling islands or under the frowning cliffs of the mainland had meant a battle or a storm.  Either the gales blew, threatening destruction, or the war canoes came off, manned by howling natives with the war- paint on their faces, who came to learn the bloody virtues of the sea-rovers' gunpowder.  South, south they had coasted, clear to the myth-land of California.  Here, it was said, were Spanish adventurers who had fought their way up from Mexico.  He had had hopes of those Spanish adventurers.  Escaping to them, the rest would have been easy--a year or two, what did it matter more or less--and he would win to Mexico, then a ship, and Europe would be his.  But they had met no Spaniards.  Only had they encountered the same impregnable wall of savagery.  The denizens of the confines of the world, painted for war, had driven them back from the shores.  At last, when one boat was cut off and every man killed, the commander had abandoned the quest and sailed back to the north.   <br><br>The years had passed.  He had served under Tebenkoff when Michaelovski Redoubt was built.  He had spent two years in the Kuskokwim country.  Two summers, in the month of June, he had managed to be at the head of Kotzebue Sound.  Here, at this time, the tribes assembled for barter; here were to be found spotted deerskins from Siberia, ivory from the Diomedes, walrus skins from the shores of the Arctic, strange stone lamps, passing in trade from tribe to tribe, no one knew whence, and, once, a hunting-knife of English make; and here, Subienkow knew, was the school in which to learn geography. For he met Eskimos from Norton Sound, from King Island and St. Lawrence Island, from Cape Prince of Wales, and Point Barrow.  Such places had other names, and their distances were measured in days.  <br><br>It was a vast region these trading savages came from, and a vaster region from which, by repeated trade, their stone lamps and that steel knife had come.  Subienkow bullied, and cajoled, and bribed. Every far-journeyer or strange tribesman was brought before him. Perils unaccountable and unthinkable were mentioned, as well as wild beasts, hostile tribes, impenetrable forests, and mighty mountain ranges; but always from beyond came the rumour and the tale of white- skinned men, blue of eye and fair of hair, who fought like devils and who sought always for furs.  They were to the east--far, far to the east.  No one had seen them.  It was the word that had been passed along.   <br><br>It was a hard school.  One could not learn geography very well through the medium of strange dialects, from dark minds that mingled fact and fable and that measured distances by ""sleeps"" that varied according to the difficulty of the going.  But at last came the whisper that gave Subienkow courage.  In the east lay a great river where were these blue-eyed men.  The river was called the Yukon. South of Michaelovski Redoubt emptied another great river which the Russians knew as the Kwikpak.  These two rivers were one, ran the whisper.  <br><br>Subienkow returned to Michaelovski.  For a year he urged an expedition up the Kwikpak.  Then arose Malakoff, the Russian half- breed, to lead the wildest and most ferocious of the hell's broth of mongrel adventurers who had crossed from Kamtchatka.  Subienkow was his lieutenant.  They threaded the mazes of the great delta of the Kwikpak, picked up the first low hills on the northern bank, and for half a thousand miles, in skin canoes loaded to the gunwales with trade-goods and ammunition, fought their way against the five-knot current of a river that ran from two to ten miles wide in a channel many fathoms deep.  Malakoff decided to build the fort at Nulato. Subienkow urged to go farther.  But he quickly reconciled himself to Nulato.  The long winter was coming on.  It would be better to wait. Early the following summer, when the ice was gone, he would disappear up the Kwikpak and work his way to the Hudson Bay Company's posts. Malakoff had never heard the whisper that the Kwikpak was the Yukon, and Subienkow did not tell him.   <br><br>Came the building of the fort.  It was enforced labour.  The tiered walls of logs arose to the sighs and groans of the Nulato Indians. The lash was laid upon their backs, and it was the iron hand of the freebooters of the sea that laid on the lash.  There were Indians that ran away, and when they were caught they were brought back and spread-eagled before the fort, where they and their tribe learned the efficacy of the knout.  Two died under it; others were injured for life; and the rest took the lesson to heart and ran away no more. The snow was flying ere the fort was finished, and then it was the time for furs.  A heavy tribute was laid upon the tribe.  Blows and lashings continued, and that the tribute should be paid, the women and children were held as hostages and treated with the barbarity that only the fur-thieves knew.  <br><br>Well, it had been a sowing of blood, and now was come the harvest. The fort was gone.  In the light of its burning, half the fur-thieves had been cut down.  The other half had passed under the torture. Only Subienkow remained, or Subienkow and Big Ivan, if that whimpering, moaning thing in the snow could be called Big Ivan. Subienkow caught Yakaga grinning at him.  There was no gainsaying Yakaga.  The mark of the lash was still on his face.  After all, Subienkow could not blame him, but he disliked the thought of what Yakaga would do to him.  He thought of appealing to Makamuk, the head-chief; but his judgment told him that such appeal was useless. Then, too, he thought of bursting his bonds and dying fighting.  Such an end would be quick.  But he could not break his bonds.  Caribou thongs were stronger than he.  Still devising, another thought came to him.  He signed for Makamuk, and that an interpreter who knew the coast dialect should be brought.   <br><br>""Oh, Makamuk,"" he said, ""I am not minded to die.  I am a great man, and it were foolishness for me to die.  In truth, I shall not die.  I am not like these other carrion.""  <br><br>He looked at the moaning thing that had once been Big Ivan, and stirred it contemptuously with his toe.   <br><br>""I am too wise to die.  Behold, I have a great medicine.  I alone know this medicine.  Since I am not going to die, I shall exchange this medicine with you.""  <br><br>""What is this medicine?"" Makamuk demanded.   <br><br>""It is a strange medicine.""  <br><br>Subienkow debated with himself for a moment, as if loth to part with the secret.   <br><br>""I will tell you.  A little bit of this medicine rubbed on the skin makes the skin hard like a rock, hard like iron, so that no cutting weapon can cut it.  The strongest blow of a cutting weapon is a vain thing against it.  A bone knife becomes like a piece of mud; and it will turn the edge of the iron knives we have brought among you. What will you give me for the secret of the medicine?""  <br><br>""I will give you your life,"" Makamuk made answer through the interpreter.   <br><br>Subienkow laughed scornfully.  <br><br>""And you shall be a slave in my house until you die.""   <br><br>The Pole laughed more scornfully.  <br><br>""Untie my hands and feet and let us talk,"" he said.   <br><br>The chief made the sign; and when he was loosed Subienkow rolled a cigarette and lighted it.  <br><br>""This is foolish talk,"" said Makamuk.  ""There is no such medicine. It cannot be.  A cutting edge is stronger than any medicine.""   <br><br>The chief was incredulous, and yet he wavered.  He had seen too many deviltries of fur-thieves that worked.  He could not wholly doubt.  <br><br>""I will give you your life; but you shall not be a slave,"" he announced.   <br><br>""More than that.""  <br><br>Subienkow played his game as coolly as if he were bartering for a foxskin.   <br><br>""It is a very great medicine.  It has saved my life many times.  I want a sled and dogs, and six of your hunters to travel with me down the river and give me safety to one day's sleep from Michaelovski Redoubt.""  <br><br>""You must live here, and teach us all of your deviltries,"" was the reply.   <br><br>Subienkow shrugged his shoulders and remained silent.  He blew cigarette smoke out on the icy air, and curiously regarded what remained of the big Cossack.  <br><br>""That scar!"" Makamuk said suddenly, pointing to the Pole's neck, where a livid mark advertised the slash of a knife in a Kamtchatkan brawl.  ""The medicine is not good.  The cutting edge was stronger than the medicine.""   <br><br>""It was a strong man that drove the stroke.""  (Subienkow considered.) ""Stronger than you, stronger than your strongest hunter, stronger than he.""  <br><br>Again, with the toe of his moccasin, he touched the Cossack--a grisly spectacle, no longer conscious--yet in whose dismembered body the pain-racked life clung and was loth to go.   <br><br>""Also, the medicine was weak.  For at that place there were no berries of a certain kind, of which I see you have plenty in this country.  The medicine here will be strong.""  <br><br>""I will let you go down river,"" said Makamuk; ""and the sled and the dogs and the six hunters to give you safety shall be yours.""   <br><br>""You are slow,"" was the cool rejoinder.  ""You have committed an offence against my medicine in that you did not at once accept my terms.  Behold, I now demand more.  I want one hundred beaver skins."" (Makamuk sneered.)  <br><br>""I want one hundred pounds of dried fish.""  (Makamuk nodded, for fish were plentiful and cheap.)  ""I want two sleds--one for me and one for my furs and fish.  And my rifle must be returned to me.  If you do not like the price, in a little while the price will grow.""   <br><br>Yakaga whispered to the chief.  <br><br>""But how can I know your medicine is true medicine?"" Makamuk asked.   <br><br>""It is very easy.  First, I shall go into the woods--""  <br><br>Again Yakaga whispered to Makamuk, who made a suspicious dissent.   <br><br>""You can send twenty hunters with me,"" Subienkow went on.  ""You see, I must get the berries and the roots with which to make the medicine. Then, when you have brought the two sleds and loaded on them the fish and the beaver skins and the rifle, and when you have told off the six hunters who will go with me--then, when all is ready, I will rub the medicine on my neck, so, and lay my neck there on that log.  Then can your strongest hunter take the axe and strike three times on my neck.  You yourself can strike the three times.""  <br><br>Makamuk stood with gaping mouth, drinking in this latest and most wonderful magic of the fur-thieves.   <br><br>""But first,"" the Pole added hastily, ""between each blow I must put on fresh medicine.  The axe is heavy and sharp, and I want no mistakes.""  <br><br>""All that you have asked shall be yours,"" Makamuk cried in a rush of acceptance.  ""Proceed to make your medicine.""   <br><br>Subienkow concealed his elation.  He was playing a desperate game, and there must be no slips.  He spoke arrogantly.  <br><br>""You have been slow.  My medicine is offended.  To make the offence clean you must give me your daughter.""   <br><br>He pointed to the girl, an unwholesome creature, with a cast in one eye and a bristling wolf-tooth.  Makamuk was angry, but the Pole remained imperturbable, rolling and lighting another cigarette.  <br><br>""Make haste,"" he threatened.  ""If you are not quick, I shall demand yet more.""   <br><br>In the silence that followed, the dreary northland scene faded before him, and he saw once more his native land, and France, and, once, as he glanced at the wolf-toothed girl, he remembered another girl, a singer and a dancer, whom he had known when first as a youth he came to Paris.  <br><br>""What do you want with the girl?"" Makamuk asked.   <br><br>""To go down the river with me.""  Subienkow glanced over her critically.  ""She will make a good wife, and it is an honour worthy of my medicine to be married to your blood.""  <br><br>Again he remembered the singer and dancer and hummed aloud a song she had taught him.  He lived the old life over, but in a detached, impersonal sort of way, looking at the memory-pictures of his own life as if they were pictures in a book of anybody's life.  The chief's voice, abruptly breaking the silence, startled him   <br><br>""It shall be done,"" said Makamuk.  ""The girl shall go down the river with you.  But be it understood that I myself strike the three blows with the axe on your neck.""  <br><br>""But each time I shall put on the medicine,"" Subienkow answered, with a show of ill-concealed anxiety.   <br><br>""You shall put the medicine on between each blow.  Here are the hunters who shall see you do not escape.  Go into the forest and gather your medicine.""  <br><br>Makamuk had been convinced of the worth of the medicine by the Pole's rapacity.  Surely nothing less than the greatest of medicines could enable a man in the shadow of death to stand up and drive an old- woman's bargain.   <br><br>""Besides,"" whispered Yakaga, when the Pole, with his guard, had disappeared among the spruce trees, ""when you have learned the medicine you can easily destroy him.""  <br><br>""But how can I destroy him?"" Makamuk argued.  ""His medicine will not let me destroy him.""   <br><br>""There will be some part where he has not rubbed the medicine,"" was Yakaga's reply.  ""We will destroy him through that part.  It may be his ears.  Very well; we will thrust a spear in one ear and out the other.  Or it may be his eyes.  Surely the medicine will be much too strong to rub on his eyes.""  <br><br>The chief nodded.  ""You are wise, Yakaga.  If he possesses no other devil-things, we will then destroy him.""   <br><br>Subienkow did not waste time in gathering the ingredients for his medicine, he selected whatsoever came to hand such as spruce needles, the inner bark of the willow, a strip of birch bark, and a quantity of moss-berries, which he made the hunters dig up for him from beneath the snow.  A few frozen roots completed his supply, and he led the way back to camp.  <br><br>Makamuk and Yakaga crouched beside him, noting the quantities and kinds of the ingredients he dropped into the pot of boiling water.   <br><br>""You must be careful that the moss-berries go in first,"" he explained.  <br><br>""And--oh, yes, one other thing--the finger of a man.  Here, Yakaga, let me cut off your finger.""   <br><br>But Yakaga put his hands behind him and scowled.  <br><br>""Just a small finger,"" Subienkow pleaded.   <br><br>""Yakaga, give him your finger,"" Makamuk commanded.  <br><br>""There be plenty of fingers lying around,"" Yakaga grunted, indicating the human wreckage in the snow of the score of persons who had been tortured to death.   <br><br>""It must be the finger of a live man,"" the Pole objected.  <br><br>""Then shall you have the finger of a live man.""  Yakaga strode over to the Cossack and sliced off a finger.   <br><br>""He is not yet dead,"" he announced, flinging the bloody trophy in the snow at the Pole's feet.  ""Also, it is a good finger, because it is large.""  <br><br>Subienkow dropped it into the fire under the pot and began to sing. It was a French love-song that with great solemnity he sang into the brew.   <br><br>""Without these words I utter into it, the medicine is worthless,"" he explained.  ""The words are the chiefest strength of it.  Behold, it is ready.""  <br><br>""Name the words slowly, that I may know them,"" Makamuk commanded.   <br><br>""Not until after the test.  When the axe flies back three times from my neck, then will I give you the secret of the words.""  <br><br>""But if the medicine is not good medicine?"" Makamuk queried anxiously.   <br><br>Subienkow turned upon him wrathfully.  <br><br>""My medicine is always good.  However, if it is not good, then do by me as you have done to the others.  Cut me up a bit at a time, even as you have cut him up.""  He pointed to the Cossack.  ""The medicine is now cool.  Thus, I rub it on my neck, saying this further medicine.""   <br><br>With great gravity he slowly intoned a line of the ""Marseillaise,"" at the same time rubbing the villainous brew thoroughly into his neck.  <br><br>An outcry interrupted his play-acting.  The giant Cossack, with a last resurgence of his tremendous vitality, had arisen to his knees. Laughter and cries of surprise and applause arose from the Nulatos, as Big Ivan began flinging himself about in the snow with mighty spasms.   <br><br>Subienkow was made sick by the sight, but he mastered his qualms and made believe to be angry.  <br><br>""This will not do,"" he said.  ""Finish him, and then we will make the test.  Here, you, Yakaga, see that his noise ceases.""   <br><br>While this was being done, Subienkow turned to Makamuk.  <br><br>""And remember, you are to strike hard.  This is not baby-work.  Here, take the axe and strike the log, so that I can see you strike like a man.""   <br><br>Makamuk obeyed, striking twice, precisely and with vigour, cutting out a large chip.  <br><br>""It is well.""  Subienkow looked about him at the circle of savage faces that somehow seemed to symbolize the wall of savagery that had hemmed him about ever since the Czar's police had first arrested him in Warsaw.  ""Take your axe, Makamuk, and stand so.  I shall lie down. When I raise my hand, strike, and strike with all your might.  And be careful that no one stands behind you.  The medicine is good, and the axe may bounce from off my neck and right out of your hands.""   <br><br>He looked at the two sleds, with the dogs in harness, loaded with furs and fish.  His rifle lay on top of the beaver skins.  The six hunters who were to act as his guard stood by the sleds.""  <br><br>""Where is the girl?"" the Pole demanded.  ""Bring her up to the sleds before the test goes on.""   <br><br>When this had been carried out, Subienkow lay down in the snow, resting his head on the log like a tired child about to sleep.  He had lived so many dreary years that he was indeed tired.  <br><br>""I laugh at you and your strength, O Makamuk,"" he said.  ""Strike, and strike hard.""   <br><br>He lifted his hand.  Makamuk swung the axe, a broadaxe for the squaring of logs.  The bright steel flashed through the frosty air, poised for a perceptible instant above Makamuk's head, then descended upon Subienkow's bare neck.  Clear through flesh and bone it cut its way, biting deeply into the log beneath.  The amazed savages saw the head bounce a yard away from the blood-spouting trunk.  <br><br>There was a great bewilderment and silence, while slowly it began to dawn in their minds that there had been no medicine.  The fur-thief had outwitted them.  Alone, of all their prisoners, he had escaped the torture.  That had been the stake for which he played.  A great roar of laughter went up.  Makamuk bowed his head in shame.  The fur- thief had fooled him.  He had lost face before all his people.  Still they continued to roar out their laughter.  Makamuk turned, and with bowed head stalked away.  He knew that thenceforth he would be no longer known as Makamuk.  He would be Lost Face; the record of his shame would be with him until he died; and whenever the tribes gathered in the spring for the salmon, or in the summer for the trading, the story would pass back and forth across the camp-fires of how the fur-thief died peaceably, at a single stroke, by the hand of Lost Face.   <br><br>""Who was Lost Face?"" he could hear, in anticipation, some insolent young buck demand, ""Oh, Lost Face,"" would be the answer, ""he who once was Makamuk in the days before he cut off the fur-thief's head.""                                    <br><br>"
35,Love of Life,"<pre>  ""This out of all will remain -  They have lived and have tossed:  So much of the game will be gain,  Though the gold of the dice has been lost.""</pre>      <br><br>THEY limped painfully down the bank, and once the foremost of the   two men staggered among the rough-strewn rocks.  They were tired   and weak, and their faces had the drawn expression of patience   which comes of hardship long endured.  They were heavily burdened   with blanket packs which were strapped to their shoulders.  Head-  straps, passing across the forehead, helped support these packs.    Each man carried a rifle.  They walked in a stooped posture, the   shoulders well forward, the head still farther forward, the eyes   bent upon the ground.    <br><br>""I wish we had just about two of them cartridges that's layin' in   that cache of ourn,"" said the second man.      <br><br>His voice was utterly and drearily expressionless.  He spoke   without enthusiasm; and the first man, limping into the milky   stream that foamed over the rocks, vouchsafed no reply.    <br><br>The other man followed at his heels.  They did not remove their   foot-gear, though the water was icy cold - so cold that their   ankles ached and their feet went numb.  In places the water dashed   against their knees, and both men staggered for footing.      <br><br>The man who followed slipped on a smooth boulder, nearly fell, but   recovered himself with a violent effort, at the same time uttering   a sharp exclamation of pain.  He seemed faint and dizzy and put out   his free hand while he reeled, as though seeking support against   the air.  When he had steadied himself he stepped forward, but   reeled again and nearly fell.  Then he stood still and looked at   the other man, who had never turned his head.    <br><br>The man stood still for fully a minute, as though debating with   himself.  Then he called out:      <br><br>""I say, Bill, I've sprained my ankle.""    <br><br>Bill staggered on through the milky water.  He did not look around.    The man watched him go, and though his face was expressionless as   ever, his eyes were like the eyes of a wounded deer.      <br><br>The other man limped up the farther bank and continued straight on   without looking back.  The man in the stream watched him.  His lips   trembled a little, so that the rough thatch of brown hair which   covered them was visibly agitated.  His tongue even strayed out to   moisten them.    <br><br>""Bill!"" he cried out.      <br><br>It was the pleading cry of a strong man in distress, but Bill's   head did not turn.  The man watched him go, limping grotesquely and   lurching forward with stammering gait up the slow slope toward the   soft sky-line of the low-lying hill.  He watched him go till he   passed over the crest and disappeared.  Then he turned his gaze and   slowly took in the circle of the world that remained to him now   that Bill was gone.    <br><br>Near the horizon the sun was smouldering dimly, almost obscured by   formless mists and vapors, which gave an impression of mass and   density without outline or tangibility.  The man pulled out his   watch, the while resting his weight on one leg.  It was four   o'clock, and as the season was near the last of July or first of   August, - he did not know the precise date within a week or two, -   he knew that the sun roughly marked the northwest.  He looked to   the south and knew that somewhere beyond those bleak hills lay the   Great Bear Lake; also, he knew that in that direction the Arctic   Circle cut its forbidding way across the Canadian Barrens.  This   stream in which he stood was a feeder to the Coppermine River,   which in turn flowed north and emptied into Coronation Gulf and the   Arctic Ocean.  He had never been there, but he had seen it, once,   on a Hudson Bay Company chart.      <br><br>Again his gaze completed the circle of the world about him.  It was   not a heartening spectacle.  Everywhere was soft sky-line.  The   hills were all low-lying.  There were no trees, no shrubs, no   grasses - naught but a tremendous and terrible desolation that sent   fear swiftly dawning into his eyes.    <br><br>""Bill!"" he whispered, once and twice; ""Bill!""      <br><br>He cowered in the midst of the milky water, as though the vastness   were pressing in upon him with overwhelming force, brutally   crushing him with its complacent awfulness.  He began to shake as   with an ague-fit, till the gun fell from his hand with a splash.    This served to rouse him.  He fought with his fear and pulled   himself together, groping in the water and recovering the weapon.    He hitched his pack farther over on his left shoulder, so as to   take a portion of its weight from off the injured ankle.  Then he   proceeded, slowly and carefully, wincing with pain, to the bank.    <br><br>He did not stop.  With a desperation that was madness, unmindful of   the pain, he hurried up the slope to the crest of the hill over   which his comrade had disappeared - more grotesque and comical by   far than that limping, jerking comrade.  But at the crest he saw a   shallow valley, empty of life.  He fought with his fear again,   overcame it, hitched the pack still farther over on his left   shoulder, and lurched on down the slope.      <br><br>The bottom of the valley was soggy with water, which the thick moss   held, spongelike, close to the surface.  This water squirted out   from under his feet at every step, and each time he lifted a foot   the action culminated in a sucking sound as the wet moss   reluctantly released its grip.  He picked his way from muskeg to   muskeg, and followed the other man's footsteps along and across the   rocky ledges which thrust like islets through the sea of moss.    <br><br>Though alone, he was not lost.  Farther on he knew he would come to   where dead spruce and fir, very small and weazened, bordered the   shore of a little lake, the TITCHIN-NICHILIE, in the tongue of the   country, the ""land of little sticks.""  And into that lake flowed a   small stream, the water of which was not milky.  There was rush-  grass on that stream - this he remembered well - but no timber, and   he would follow it till its first trickle ceased at a divide.  He   would cross this divide to the first trickle of another stream,   flowing to the west, which he would follow until it emptied into   the river Dease, and here he would find a cache under an upturned   canoe and piled over with many rocks.  And in this cache would be   ammunition for his empty gun, fish-hooks and lines, a small net -   all the utilities for the killing and snaring of food.  Also, he   would find flour, - not much, - a piece of bacon, and some beans.      <br><br>Bill would be waiting for him there, and they would paddle away   south down the Dease to the Great Bear Lake.  And south across the   lake they would go, ever south, till they gained the Mackenzie.    And south, still south, they would go, while the winter raced   vainly after them, and the ice formed in the eddies, and the days   grew chill and crisp, south to some warm Hudson Bay Company post,   where timber grew tall and generous and there was grub without end.    <br><br>These were the thoughts of the man as he strove onward.  But hard   as he strove with his body, he strove equally hard with his mind,   trying to think that Bill had not deserted him, that Bill would   surely wait for him at the cache.  He was compelled to think this   thought, or else there would not be any use to strive, and he would   have lain down and died.  And as the dim ball of the sun sank   slowly into the northwest he covered every inch - and many times -   of his and Bill's flight south before the downcoming winter.  And   he conned the grub of the cache and the grub of the Hudson Bay   Company post over and over again.  He had not eaten for two days;   for a far longer time he had not had all he wanted to eat.  Often   he stooped and picked pale muskeg berries, put them into his mouth,   and chewed and swallowed them.  A muskeg berry is a bit of seed   enclosed in a bit of water.  In the mouth the water melts away and   the seed chews sharp and bitter.  The man knew there was no   nourishment in the berries, but he chewed them patiently with a   hope greater than knowledge and defying experience.      <br><br>At nine o'clock he stubbed his toe on a rocky ledge, and from sheer   weariness and weakness staggered and fell.  He lay for some time,   without movement, on his side.  Then he slipped out of the pack-  straps and clumsily dragged himself into a sitting posture.  It was   not yet dark, and in the lingering twilight he groped about among   the rocks for shreds of dry moss.  When he had gathered a heap he   built a fire, - a smouldering, smudgy fire, - and put a tin pot of   water on to boil.    <br><br>He unwrapped his pack and the first thing he did was to count his   matches.  There were sixty-seven.  He counted them three times to   make sure.  He divided them into several portions, wrapping them in   oil paper, disposing of one bunch in his empty tobacco pouch, of   another bunch in the inside band of his battered hat, of a third   bunch under his shirt on the chest.  This accomplished, a panic   came upon him, and he unwrapped them all and counted them again.    There were still sixty-seven.      <br><br>He dried his wet foot-gear by the fire.  The moccasins were in   soggy shreds.  The blanket socks were worn through in places, and   his feet were raw and bleeding.  His ankle was throbbing, and he   gave it an examination.  It had swollen to the size of his knee.    He tore a long strip from one of his two blankets and bound the   ankle tightly.  He tore other strips and bound them about his feet   to serve for both moccasins and socks.  Then he drank the pot of   water, steaming hot, wound his watch, and crawled between his   blankets.    <br><br>He slept like a dead man.  The brief darkness around midnight came   and went.  The sun arose in the northeast - at least the day dawned   in that quarter, for the sun was hidden by gray clouds.      <br><br>At six o'clock he awoke, quietly lying on his back.  He gazed   straight up into the gray sky and knew that he was hungry.  As he   rolled over on his elbow he was startled by a loud snort, and saw a   bull caribou regarding him with alert curiosity.  The animal was   not mere than fifty feet away, and instantly into the man's mind   leaped the vision and the savor of a caribou steak sizzling and   frying over a fire.  Mechanically he reached for the empty gun,   drew a bead, and pulled the trigger.  The bull snorted and leaped   away, his hoofs rattling and clattering as he fled across the   ledges.    <br><br>The man cursed and flung the empty gun from him.  He groaned aloud   as he started to drag himself to his feet.  It was a slow and   arduous task.      <br><br>His joints were like rusty hinges.  They worked harshly in their   sockets, with much friction, and each bending or unbending was   accomplished only through a sheer exertion of will.  When he   finally gained his feet, another minute or so was consumed in   straightening up, so that he could stand erect as a man should   stand.    <br><br>He crawled up a small knoll and surveyed the prospect.  There were   no trees, no bushes, nothing but a gray sea of moss scarcely   diversified by gray rocks, gray lakelets, and gray streamlets.  The   sky was gray.  There was no sun nor hint of sun.  He had no idea of   north, and he had forgotten the way he had come to this spot the   night before.  But he was not lost.  He knew that.  Soon he would   come to the land of the little sticks.  He felt that it lay off to   the left somewhere, not far - possibly just over the next low hill.      <br><br>He went back to put his pack into shape for travelling.  He assured   himself of the existence of his three separate parcels of matches,   though he did not stop to count them.  But he did linger, debating,   over a squat moose-hide sack.  It was not large.  He could hide it   under his two hands.  He knew that it weighed fifteen pounds, - as   much as all the rest of the pack, - and it worried him.  He finally   set it to one side and proceeded to roll the pack.  He paused to   gaze at the squat moose-hide sack.  He picked it up hastily with a   defiant glance about him, as though the desolation were trying to   rob him of it; and when he rose to his feet to stagger on into the   day, it was included in the pack on his back.    <br><br>He bore away to the left, stopping now and again to eat muskeg   berries.  His ankle had stiffened, his limp was more pronounced,   but the pain of it was as nothing compared with the pain of his   stomach.  The hunger pangs were sharp.  They gnawed and gnawed   until he could not keep his mind steady on the course he must   pursue to gain the land of little sticks.  The muskeg berries did   not allay this gnawing, while they made his tongue and the roof of   his mouth sore with their irritating bite.      <br><br>He came upon a valley where rock ptarmigan rose on whirring wings   from the ledges and muskegs.  Ker - ker - ker was the cry they   made.  He threw stones at them, but could not hit them.  He placed   his pack on the ground and stalked them as a cat stalks a sparrow.    The sharp rocks cut through his pants' legs till his knees left a   trail of blood; but the hurt was lost in the hurt of his hunger.    He squirmed over the wet moss, saturating his clothes and chilling   his body; but he was not aware of it, so great was his fever for   food.  And always the ptarmigan rose, whirring, before him, till   their ker - ker - ker became a mock to him, and he cursed them and   cried aloud at them with their own cry.    <br><br>Once he crawled upon one that must have been asleep.  He did not   see it till it shot up in his face from its rocky nook.  He made a   clutch as startled as was the rise of the ptarmigan, and there   remained in his hand three tail-feathers.  As he watched its flight   he hated it, as though it had done him some terrible wrong.  Then   he returned and shouldered his pack.      <br><br>As the day wore along he came into valleys or swales where game was   more plentiful.  A band of caribou passed by, twenty and odd   animals, tantalizingly within rifle range.  He felt a wild desire   to run after them, a certitude that he could run them down.  A   black fox came toward him, carrying a ptarmigan in his mouth.  The   man shouted.  It was a fearful cry, but the fox, leaping away in   fright, did not drop the ptarmigan.    <br><br>Late in the afternoon he followed a stream, milky with lime, which   ran through sparse patches of rush-grass.  Grasping these rushes   firmly near the root, he pulled up what resembled a young onion-  sprout no larger than a shingle-nail.  It was tender, and his teeth   sank into it with a crunch that promised deliciously of food.  But   its fibers were tough.  It was composed of stringy filaments   saturated with water, like the berries, and devoid of nourishment.    He threw off his pack and went into the rush-grass on hands and   knees, crunching and munching, like some bovine creature.      <br><br>He was very weary and often wished to rest - to lie down and sleep;   but he was continually driven on - not so much by his desire to   gain the land of little sticks as by his hunger.  He searched   little ponds for frogs and dug up the earth with his nails for   worms, though he knew in spite that neither frogs nor worms existed   so far north.    <br><br>He looked into every pool of water vainly, until, as the long   twilight came on, he discovered a solitary fish, the size of a   minnow, in such a pool.  He plunged his arm in up to the shoulder,   but it eluded him.  He reached for it with both hands and stirred   up the milky mud at the bottom.  In his excitement he fell in,   wetting himself to the waist.  Then the water was too muddy to   admit of his seeing the fish, and he was compelled to wait until   the sediment had settled.      <br><br>The pursuit was renewed, till the water was again muddied.  But he   could not wait.  He unstrapped the tin bucket and began to bale the   pool.  He baled wildly at first, splashing himself and flinging the   water so short a distance that it ran back into the pool.  He   worked more carefully, striving to be cool, though his heart was   pounding against his chest and his hands were trembling.  At the   end of half an hour the pool was nearly dry.  Not a cupful of water   remained.  And there was no fish.  He found a hidden crevice among   the stones through which it had escaped to the adjoining and larger   pool - a pool which he could not empty in a night and a day.  Had   he known of the crevice, he could have closed it with a rock at the   beginning and the fish would have been his.    <br><br>Thus he thought, and crumpled up and sank down upon the wet earth.    At first he cried softly to himself, then he cried loudly to the   pitiless desolation that ringed him around; and for a long time   after he was shaken by great dry sobs.      <br><br>He built a fire and warmed himself by drinking quarts of hot water,   and made camp on a rocky ledge in the same fashion he had the night   before.  The last thing he did was to see that his matches were dry   and to wind his watch.  The blankets were wet and clammy.  His   ankle pulsed with pain.  But he knew only that he was hungry, and   through his restless sleep he dreamed of feasts and banquets and of   food served and spread in all imaginable ways.    <br><br>He awoke chilled and sick.  There was no sun.  The gray of earth   and sky had become deeper, more profound.  A raw wind was blowing,   and the first flurries of snow were whitening the hilltops.  The   air about him thickened and grew white while he made a fire and   boiled more water.  It was wet snow, half rain, and the flakes were   large and soggy.  At first they melted as soon as they came in   contact with the earth, but ever more fell, covering the ground,   putting out the fire, spoiling his supply of moss-fuel.      <br><br>This was a signal for him to strap on his pack and stumble onward,   he knew not where.  He was not concerned with the land of little   sticks, nor with Bill and the cache under the upturned canoe by the   river Dease.  He was mastered by the verb ""to eat.""  He was hunger-  mad.  He took no heed of the course he pursued, so long as that   course led him through the swale bottoms.  He felt his way through   the wet snow to the watery muskeg berries, and went by feel as he   pulled up the rush-grass by the roots.  But it was tasteless stuff   and did not satisfy.  He found a weed that tasted sour and he ate   all he could find of it, which was not much, for it was a creeping   growth, easily hidden under the several inches of snow.    <br><br>He had no fire that night, nor hot water, and crawled under his   blanket to sleep the broken hunger-sleep.  The snow turned into a   cold rain.  He awakened many times to feel it falling on his   upturned face.  Day came - a gray day and no sun.  It had ceased   raining.  The keenness of his hunger had departed.  Sensibility, as   far as concerned the yearning for food, had been exhausted.  There   was a dull, heavy ache in his stomach, but it did not bother him so   much.  He was more rational, and once more he was chiefly   interested in the land of little sticks and the cache by the river   Dease.      <br><br>He ripped the remnant of one of his blankets into strips and bound   his bleeding feet.  Also, he recinched the injured ankle and   prepared himself for a day of travel.  When he came to his pack, he   paused long over the squat moose-hide sack, but in the end it went   with him.    <br><br>The snow had melted under the rain, and only the hilltops showed   white.  The sun came out, and he succeeded in locating the points   of the compass, though he knew now that he was lost.  Perhaps, in   his previous days' wanderings, he had edged away too far to the   left.  He now bore off to the right to counteract the possible   deviation from his true course.      <br><br>Though the hunger pangs were no longer so exquisite, he realized   that he was weak.  He was compelled to pause for frequent rests,   when he attacked the muskeg berries and rush-grass patches.  His   tongue felt dry and large, as though covered with a fine hairy   growth, and it tasted bitter in his mouth.  His heart gave him a   great deal of trouble.  When he had travelled a few minutes it   would begin a remorseless thump, thump, thump, and then leap up and   away in a painful flutter of beats that choked him and made him go   faint and dizzy.    <br><br>In the middle of the day he found two minnows in a large pool.  It   was impossible to bale it, but he was calmer now and managed to   catch them in his tin bucket.  They were no longer than his little   finger, but he was not particularly hungry.  The dull ache in his   stomach had been growing duller and fainter.  It seemed almost that   his stomach was dozing.  He ate the fish raw, masticating with   painstaking care, for the eating was an act of pure reason.  While   he had no desire to eat, he knew that he must eat to live.      <br><br>In the evening he caught three more minnows, eating two and saving   the third for breakfast.  The sun had dried stray shreds of moss,   and he was able to warm himself with hot water.  He had not covered   more than ten miles that day; and the next day, travelling whenever   his heart permitted him, he covered no more than five miles.  But   his stomach did not give him the slightest uneasiness.  It had gone   to sleep.  He was in a strange country, too, and the caribou were   growing more plentiful, also the wolves.  Often their yelps drifted   across the desolation, and once he saw three of them slinking away   before his path.    <br><br>Another night; and in the morning, being more rational, he untied   the leather string that fastened the squat moose-hide sack.  From   its open mouth poured a yellow stream of coarse gold-dust and   nuggets.  He roughly divided the gold in halves, caching one half   on a prominent ledge, wrapped in a piece of blanket, and returning   the other half to the sack.  He also began to use strips of the one   remaining blanket for his feet.  He still clung to his gun, for   there were cartridges in that cache by the river Dease.      <br><br>This was a day of fog, and this day hunger awoke in him again.  He   was very weak and was afflicted with a giddiness which at times   blinded him.  It was no uncommon thing now for him to stumble and   fall; and stumbling once, he fell squarely into a ptarmigan nest.    There were four newly hatched chicks, a day old - little specks of   pulsating life no more than a mouthful; and he ate them ravenously,   thrusting them alive into his mouth and crunching them like egg-  shells between his teeth.  The mother ptarmigan beat about him with   great outcry.  He used his gun as a club with which to knock her   over, but she dodged out of reach.  He threw stones at her and with   one chance shot broke a wing.  Then she fluttered away, running,   trailing the broken wing, with him in pursuit.    <br><br>The little chicks had no more than whetted his appetite.  He hopped   and bobbed clumsily along on his injured ankle, throwing stones and   screaming hoarsely at times; at other times hopping and bobbing   silently along, picking himself up grimly and patiently when he   fell, or rubbing his eyes with his hand when the giddiness   threatened to overpower him.      <br><br>The chase led him across swampy ground in the bottom of the valley,   and he came upon footprints in the soggy moss.  They were not his   own - he could see that.  They must be Bill's.  But he could not   stop, for the mother ptarmigan was running on.  He would catch her   first, then he would return and investigate.    <br><br>He exhausted the mother ptarmigan; but he exhausted himself.  She   lay panting on her side.  He lay panting on his side, a dozen feet   away, unable to crawl to her.  And as he recovered she recovered,   fluttering out of reach as his hungry hand went out to her.  The   chase was resumed.  Night settled down and she escaped.  He   stumbled from weakness and pitched head foremost on his face,   cutting his cheek, his pack upon his back.  He did not move for a   long while; then he rolled over on his side, wound his watch, and   lay there until morning.      <br><br>Another day of fog.  Half of his last blanket had gone into foot-  wrappings.  He failed to pick up Bill's trail.  It did not matter.    His hunger was driving him too compellingly - only - only he   wondered if Bill, too, were lost.  By midday the irk of his pack   became too oppressive.  Again he divided the gold, this time merely   spilling half of it on the ground.  In the afternoon he threw the   rest of it away, there remaining to him only the half-blanket, the   tin bucket, and the rifle.    <br><br>An hallucination began to trouble him.  He felt confident that one   cartridge remained to him.  It was in the chamber of the rifle and   he had overlooked it.  On the other hand, he knew all the time that   the chamber was empty.  But the hallucination persisted.  He fought   it off for hours, then threw his rifle open and was confronted with   emptiness.  The disappointment was as bitter as though he had   really expected to find the cartridge.      <br><br>He plodded on for half an hour, when the hallucination arose again.    Again he fought it, and still it persisted, till for very relief he   opened his rifle to unconvince himself.  At times his mind wandered   farther afield, and he plodded on, a mere automaton, strange   conceits and whimsicalities gnawing at his brain like worms.  But   these excursions out of the real were of brief duration, for ever   the pangs of the hunger-bite called him back.  He was jerked back   abruptly once from such an excursion by a sight that caused him   nearly to faint.  He reeled and swayed, doddering like a drunken   man to keep from falling.  Before him stood a horse.  A horse!  He   could not believe his eyes.  A thick mist was in them, intershot   with sparkling points of light.  He rubbed his eyes savagely to   clear his vision, and beheld, not a horse, but a great brown bear.    The animal was studying him with bellicose curiosity.    <br><br>The man had brought his gun halfway to his shoulder before he   realized.  He lowered it and drew his hunting-knife from its beaded   sheath at his hip.  Before him was meat and life.  He ran his thumb   along the edge of his knife.  It was sharp.  The point was sharp.    He would fling himself upon the bear and kill it.  But his heart   began its warning thump, thump, thump.  Then followed the wild   upward leap and tattoo of flutters, the pressing as of an iron band   about his forehead, the creeping of the dizziness into his brain.      <br><br>His desperate courage was evicted by a great surge of fear.  In his   weakness, what if the animal attacked him?  He drew himself up to   his most imposing stature, gripping the knife and staring hard at   the bear.  The bear advanced clumsily a couple of steps, reared up,   and gave vent to a tentative growl.  If the man ran, he would run   after him; but the man did not run.  He was animated now with the   courage of fear.  He, too, growled, savagely, terribly, voicing the   fear that is to life germane and that lies twisted about life's   deepest roots.    <br><br>The bear edged away to one side, growling menacingly, himself   appalled by this mysterious creature that appeared upright and   unafraid.  But the man did not move.  He stood like a statue till   the danger was past, when he yielded to a fit of trembling and sank   down into the wet moss.      <br><br>He pulled himself together and went on, afraid now in a new way.    It was not the fear that he should die passively from lack of food,   but that he should be destroyed violently before starvation had   exhausted the last particle of the endeavor in him that made toward   surviving.  There were the wolves.  Back and forth across the   desolation drifted their howls, weaving the very air into a fabric   of menace that was so tangible that he found himself, arms in the   air, pressing it back from him as it might be the walls of a wind-  blown tent.    <br><br>Now and again the wolves, in packs of two and three, crossed his   path.  But they sheered clear of him.  They were not in sufficient   numbers, and besides they were hunting the caribou, which did not   battle, while this strange creature that walked erect might scratch   and bite.      <br><br>In the late afternoon he came upon scattered bones where the wolves   had made a kill.  The debris had been a caribou calf an hour   before, squawking and running and very much alive.  He contemplated   the bones, clean-picked and polished, pink with the cell-life in   them which had not yet died.  Could it possibly be that he might be   that ere the day was done!  Such was life, eh?  A vain and fleeting   thing.  It was only life that pained.  There was no hurt in death.    To die was to sleep.  It meant cessation, rest.  Then why was he   not content to die?    <br><br>But he did not moralize long.  He was squatting in the moss, a bone   in his mouth, sucking at the shreds of life that still dyed it   faintly pink.  The sweet meaty taste, thin and elusive almost as a   memory, maddened him.  He closed his jaws on the bones and   crunched.  Sometimes it was the bone that broke, sometimes his   teeth.  Then he crushed the bones between rocks, pounded them to a   pulp, and swallowed them.  He pounded his fingers, too, in his   haste, and yet found a moment in which to feel surprise at the fact   that his fingers did not hurt much when caught under the descending   rock.      <br><br>Came frightful days of snow and rain.  He did not know when he made   camp, when he broke camp.  He travelled in the night as much as in   the day.  He rested wherever he fell, crawled on whenever the dying   life in him flickered up and burned less dimly.  He, as a man, no   longer strove.  It was the life in him, unwilling to die, that   drove him on.  He did not suffer.  His nerves had become blunted,   numb, while his mind was filled with weird visions and delicious   dreams.    <br><br>But ever he sucked and chewed on the crushed bones of the caribou   calf, the least remnants of which he had gathered up and carried   with him.  He crossed no more hills or divides, but automatically   followed a large stream which flowed through a wide and shallow   valley.  He did not see this stream nor this valley.  He saw   nothing save visions.  Soul and body walked or crawled side by   side, yet apart, so slender was the thread that bound them.      <br><br>He awoke in his right mind, lying on his back on a rocky ledge.    The sun was shining bright and warm.  Afar off he heard the   squawking of caribou calves.  He was aware of vague memories of   rain and wind and snow, but whether he had been beaten by the storm   for two days or two weeks he did not know.    <br><br>For some time he lay without movement, the genial sunshine pouring   upon him and saturating his miserable body with its warmth.  A fine   day, he thought.  Perhaps he could manage to locate himself.  By a   painful effort he rolled over on his side.  Below him flowed a wide   and sluggish river.  Its unfamiliarity puzzled him.  Slowly he   followed it with his eyes, winding in wide sweeps among the bleak,   bare hills, bleaker and barer and lower-lying than any hills he had   yet encountered.  Slowly, deliberately, without excitement or more   than the most casual interest, he followed the course of the   strange stream toward the sky-line and saw it emptying into a   bright and shining sea.  He was still unexcited.  Most unusual, he   thought, a vision or a mirage - more likely a vision, a trick of   his disordered mind.  He was confirmed in this by sight of a ship   lying at anchor in the midst of the shining sea.  He closed his   eyes for a while, then opened them.  Strange how the vision   persisted!  Yet not strange.  He knew there were no seas or ships   in the heart of the barren lands, just as he had known there was no   cartridge in the empty rifle.      <br><br>He heard a snuffle behind him - a half-choking gasp or cough.  Very   slowly, because of his exceeding weakness and stiffness, he rolled   over on his other side.  He could see nothing near at hand, but he   waited patiently.  Again came the snuffle and cough, and outlined   between two jagged rocks not a score of feet away he made out the   gray head of a wolf.  The sharp ears were not pricked so sharply as   he had seen them on other wolves; the eyes were bleared and   bloodshot, the head seemed to droop limply and forlornly.  The   animal blinked continually in the sunshine.  It seemed sick.  As he   looked it snuffled and coughed again.    <br><br>This, at least, was real, he thought, and turned on the other side   so that he might see the reality of the world which had been veiled   from him before by the vision.  But the sea still shone in the   distance and the ship was plainly discernible.  Was it reality,   after all?  He closed his eyes for a long while and thought, and   then it came to him.  He had been making north by east, away from   the Dease Divide and into the Coppermine Valley.  This wide and   sluggish river was the Coppermine.  That shining sea was the Arctic   Ocean.  That ship was a whaler, strayed east, far east, from the   mouth of the Mackenzie, and it was lying at anchor in Coronation   Gulf.  He remembered the Hudson Bay Company chart he had seen long   ago, and it was all clear and reasonable to him.      <br><br>He sat up and turned his attention to immediate affairs.  He had   worn through the blanket-wrappings, and his feet were shapeless   lumps of raw meat.  His last blanket was gone.  Rifle and knife   were both missing.  He had lost his hat somewhere, with the bunch   of matches in the band, but the matches against his chest were safe   and dry inside the tobacco pouch and oil paper.  He looked at his   watch.  It marked eleven o'clock and was still running.  Evidently   he had kept it wound.    <br><br>He was calm and collected.  Though extremely weak, he had no   sensation of pain.  He was not hungry.  The thought of food was not   even pleasant to him, and whatever he did was done by his reason   alone.  He ripped off his pants' legs to the knees and bound them   about his feet.  Somehow he had succeeded in retaining the tin   bucket.  He would have some hot water before he began what he   foresaw was to be a terrible journey to the ship.      <br><br>His movements were slow.  He shook as with a palsy.  When he   started to collect dry moss, he found he could not rise to his   feet.  He tried again and again, then contented himself with   crawling about on hands and knees.  Once he crawled near to the   sick wolf.  The animal dragged itself reluctantly out of his way,   licking its chops with a tongue which seemed hardly to have the   strength to curl.  The man noticed that the tongue was not the   customary healthy red.  It was a yellowish brown and seemed coated   with a rough and half-dry mucus.    <br><br>After he had drunk a quart of hot water the man found he was able   to stand, and even to walk as well as a dying man might be supposed   to walk.  Every minute or so he was compelled to rest.  His steps   were feeble and uncertain, just as the wolf's that trailed him were   feeble and uncertain; and that night, when the shining sea was   blotted out by blackness, he knew he was nearer to it by no more   than four miles.      <br><br>Throughout the night he heard the cough of the sick wolf, and now   and then the squawking of the caribou calves.  There was life all   around him, but it was strong life, very much alive and well, and   he knew the sick wolf clung to the sick man's trail in the hope   that the man would die first.  In the morning, on opening his eyes,   he beheld it regarding him with a wistful and hungry stare.  It   stood crouched, with tail between its legs, like a miserable and   woe-begone dog.  It shivered in the chill morning wind, and grinned   dispiritedly when the man spoke to it in a voice that achieved no   more than a hoarse whisper.    <br><br>The sun rose brightly, and all morning the man tottered and fell   toward the ship on the shining sea.  The weather was perfect.  It   was the brief Indian Summer of the high latitudes.  It might last a   week.  To-morrow or next day it might he gone.      <br><br>In the afternoon the man came upon a trail.  It was of another man,   who did not walk, but who dragged himself on all fours.  The man   thought it might be Bill, but he thought in a dull, uninterested   way.  He had no curiosity.  In fact, sensation and emotion had left   him.  He was no longer susceptible to pain.  Stomach and nerves had   gone to sleep.  Yet the life that was in him drove him on.  He was   very weary, but it refused to die.  It was because it refused to   die that he still ate muskeg berries and minnows, drank his hot   water, and kept a wary eye on the sick wolf.    <br><br>He followed the trail of the other man who dragged himself along,   and soon came to the end of it - a few fresh-picked bones where the   soggy moss was marked by the foot-pads of many wolves.  He saw a   squat moose-hide sack, mate to his own, which had been torn by   sharp teeth.  He picked it up, though its weight was almost too   much for his feeble fingers.  Bill had carried it to the last.  Ha!   ha!  He would have the laugh on Bill.  He would survive and carry   it to the ship in the shining sea.  His mirth was hoarse and   ghastly, like a raven's croak, and the sick wolf joined him,   howling lugubriously.  The man ceased suddenly.  How could he have   the laugh on Bill if that were Bill; if those bones, so pinky-white   and clean, were Bill?      <br><br>He turned away.  Well, Bill had deserted him; but he would not take   the gold, nor would he suck Bill's bones.  Bill would have, though,   had it been the other way around, he mused as he staggered on.    <br><br>He came to a pool of water.  Stooping over in quest of minnows, he   jerked his head back as though he had been stung.  He had caught   sight of his reflected face.  So horrible was it that sensibility   awoke long enough to be shocked.  There were three minnows in the   pool, which was too large to drain; and after several ineffectual   attempts to catch them in the tin bucket he forbore.  He was   afraid, because of his great weakness, that he might fall in and   drown.  It was for this reason that he did not trust himself to the   river astride one of the many drift-logs which lined its sand-  spits.      <br><br>That day he decreased the distance between him and the ship by   three miles; the next day by two - for he was crawling now as Bill   had crawled; and the end of the fifth day found the ship still   seven miles away and him unable to make even a mile a day.  Still   the Indian Summer held on, and he continued to crawl and faint,   turn and turn about; and ever the sick wolf coughed and wheezed at   his heels.  His knees had become raw meat like his feet, and though   he padded them with the shirt from his back it was a red track he   left behind him on the moss and stones.  Once, glancing back, he   saw the wolf licking hungrily his bleeding trail, and he saw   sharply what his own end might be - unless - unless he could get   the wolf.  Then began as grim a tragedy of existence as was ever   played - a sick man that crawled, a sick wolf that limped, two   creatures dragging their dying carcasses across the desolation and   hunting each other's lives.    <br><br>Had it been a well wolf, it would not have mattered so much to the   man; but the thought of going to feed the maw of that loathsome and   all but dead thing was repugnant to him.  He was finicky.  His mind   had begun to wander again, and to be perplexed by hallucinations,   while his lucid intervals grew rarer and shorter.      <br><br>He was awakened once from a faint by a wheeze close in his ear.    The wolf leaped lamely back, losing its footing and falling in its   weakness.  It was ludicrous, but he was not amused.  Nor was he   even afraid.  He was too far gone for that.  But his mind was for   the moment clear, and he lay and considered.  The ship was no more   than four miles away.  He could see it quite distinctly when he   rubbed the mists out of his eyes, and he could see the white sail   of a small boat cutting the water of the shining sea.  But he could   never crawl those four miles.  He knew that, and was very calm in   the knowledge.  He knew that he could not crawl half a mile.  And   yet he wanted to live.  It was unreasonable that he should die   after all he had undergone.  Fate asked too much of him.  And,   dying, he declined to die.  It was stark madness, perhaps, but in   the very grip of Death he defied Death and refused to die.    <br><br>He closed his eyes and composed himself with infinite precaution.    He steeled himself to keep above the suffocating languor that   lapped like a rising tide through all the wells of his being.  It   was very like a sea, this deadly languor, that rose and rose and   drowned his consciousness bit by bit.  Sometimes he was all but   submerged, swimming through oblivion with a faltering stroke; and   again, by some strange alchemy of soul, he would find another shred   of will and strike out more strongly.      <br><br>Without movement he lay on his back, and he could hear, slowly   drawing near and nearer, the wheezing intake and output of the sick   wolf's breath.  It drew closer, ever closer, through an infinitude   of time, and he did not move.  It was at his ear.  The harsh dry   tongue grated like sandpaper against his cheek.  His hands shot out   - or at least he willed them to shoot out.  The fingers were curved   like talons, but they closed on empty air.  Swiftness and certitude   require strength, and the man had not this strength.    <br><br>The patience of the wolf was terrible.  The man's patience was no   less terrible.  For half a day he lay motionless, fighting off   unconsciousness and waiting for the thing that was to feed upon him   and upon which he wished to feed.  Sometimes the languid sea rose   over him and he dreamed long dreams; but ever through it all,   waking and dreaming, he waited for the wheezing breath and the   harsh caress of the tongue.      <br><br>He did not hear the breath, and he slipped slowly from some dream   to the feel of the tongue along his hand.  He waited.  The fangs   pressed softly; the pressure increased; the wolf was exerting its   last strength in an effort to sink teeth in the food for which it   had waited so long.  But the man had waited long, and the lacerated   hand closed on the jaw.  Slowly, while the wolf struggled feebly   and the hand clutched feebly, the other hand crept across to a   grip.  Five minutes later the whole weight of the man's body was on   top of the wolf.  The hands had not sufficient strength to choke   the wolf, but the face of the man was pressed close to the throat   of the wolf and the mouth of the man was full of hair.  At the end   of half an hour the man was aware of a warm trickle in his throat.    It was not pleasant.  It was like molten lead being forced into his   stomach, and it was forced by his will alone.  Later the man rolled   over on his back and slept.    <br><br>There were some members of a scientific expedition on the whale-  ship <i>Bedford</i>.  From the deck they remarked a strange object on the   shore.  It was moving down the beach toward the water.  They were   unable to classify it, and, being scientific men, they climbed into   the whale-boat alongside and went ashore to see.  And they saw   something that was alive but which could hardly be called a man.    It was blind, unconscious.  It squirmed along the ground like some   monstrous worm.  Most of its efforts were ineffectual, but it was   persistent, and it writhed and twisted and went ahead perhaps a   score of feet an hour.      <br><br>Three weeks afterward the man lay in a bunk on the whale-ship   <i>Bedford</i>, and with tears streaming down his wasted cheeks told who   he was and what he had undergone.  He also babbled incoherently of   his mother, of sunny Southern California, and a home among the   orange groves and flowers.    <br><br>The days were not many after that when he sat at table with the   scientific men and ship's officers.  He gloated over the spectacle   of so much food, watching it anxiously as it went into the mouths   of others.  With the disappearance of each mouthful an expression   of deep regret came into his eyes.  He was quite sane, yet he hated   those men at mealtime.  He was haunted by a fear that the food   would not last.  He inquired of the cook, the cabin-boy, the   captain, concerning the food stores.  They reassured him countless   times; but he could not believe them, and pried cunningly about the   lazarette to see with his own eyes.      <br><br> It was noticed that the man was getting fat.  He grew stouter with   each day.  The scientific men shook their heads and theorized.    They limited the man at his meals, but still his girth increased   and he swelled prodigiously under his shirt.    <br><br>The sailors grinned.  They knew.  And when the scientific men set a   watch on the man, they knew too.  They saw him slouch for'ard after   breakfast, and, like a mendicant, with outstretched palm, accost a   sailor.  The sailor grinned and passed him a fragment of sea   biscuit.  He clutched it avariciously, looked at it as a miser   looks at gold, and thrust it into his shirt bosom.  Similar were   the donations from other grinning sailors.      <br><br>The scientific men were discreet.  They let him alone.  But they   privily examined his bunk.  It was lined with hardtack; the   mattress was stuffed with hardtack; every nook and cranny was   filled with hardtack.  Yet he was sane.  He was taking precautions   against another possible famine - that was all.  He would recover   from it, the scientific men said; and he did, ere the <i>Bedford's</i>   anchor rumbled down in San Francisco Bay.                                    <br><br>"
36,Nothing that Ever Came to Anything,"It was at Quito, the mountain capital of Ecuador, that the following passage at correspondence took place. Having occasion to buy a pair of shoes in a shop six feet by eight in size and with walls three feet thick, I noticed a mangy leopard skin on the floor. I had no Spanish. The shop-keeper had no English. But I was an adept at sign language. I wanted to know where I should go to buy leopard skins. On my scribble- pad I drew the interesting streets of a city. Then I drew a small shop, which, after much effort, I persuaded the proprietor into recognising as his shop. Next, I indicated in my drawing that on the many streets there were many shops. And, finally, I made myself into a living interrogation mark, pointing all the while from the mangy leopard skin to the many shops I had sketched.<br><br>But the proprietor failed to follow me. So did his assistant. The street came in to help--that is, as many as could crowd into the six-by- eight shop; while those that could not force their way in held an overflow meeting on the sidewalk. The proprietor and the rest took turns at talking to me in rapid-fire Spanish, and, from the expressions on their faces, all concluded that I was remarkably stupid. Again I went through my programme, pointing on the sketch from the one shop to the many shops, pointing out that in this particular shop was one leopard skin, and then questing interrogatively with my pencil among all the shops. All regarded me in blank silence, until I saw comprehension suddenly dawn on the face of a small boy.<br><br>""Tigres montanya!"" he cried.<br><br>This appealed to me as mountain tigers, namely, leopards; and in token that he understood, the boy made signs for me to follow him, which I obeyed. He led me for a quarter of a mile, and paused before the doorway of a large building where soldiers slouched on sentry duty and in and out of which went other soldiers. Motioning for me to remain, he ran inside.<br><br>Fifteen minutes later he was out again, without leopard skins, but full of information. By means of my card, of my hotel card, of my watch, and of the boy's fingers, I learned the following: that at six o'clock that evening he would arrive at my hotel with ten leopard skins for my inspection. Further, I learned that the skins were the property of one Captain Ernesto Becucci. Also, I learned that the boy's name was Eliceo.<br><br>The boy was prompt. At six o'clock he was at my room. In his hand was a small roll addressed to me. On opening it I found it to be manuscript piano music, the <i>Hora Tranquila Valse</i>, or ""Tranquil Hour Waltz,"" by Ernesto Becucci. I came for leopard skins, thought I, and the owner sends me sheet music instead. But the boy assured me that he would have the skins at the hotel at nine next morning, and I entrusted to him the following letter of acknowledgment:<br><br>&#160;&#160;&#160;""DEAR CAPTAIN BECUCCI:<br/>  <br/>  &#160;&#160;&#160;""A thousand thanks for your kind presentation of <i>Hora Tranquila<br/>  &#160;&#160;&#160;Valse</i>. Mrs. London will play it for me this evening.<br/>  <br/>  &#160;&#160;&#160;""Sincerely yours,<br/>  <br/>  &#160;&#160;&#160;""Jack London.""<br><br>Next morning Eliceo was back, but without the skins. Instead, he gave me a letter, written in Spanish, of which the following is a free translation:<br><br>&#160;&#160;&#160;""To my dearest and always appreciated friend, I submit myself--<br/>  <br/>  &#160;&#160;&#160;""DEAR SIR:<br/>  <br/>  &#160;&#160;&#160;""I sent you last night an offering by the bearer of this note, and you<br/>  &#160;&#160;&#160;returned me a letter which I translated.<br/>  <br/>  &#160;&#160;&#160;""Be it known to you, sir, that I am giving this waltz away in the best<br/>  &#160;&#160;&#160;society, and therefore to your honoured self.

So to Eliceo I gave this letter for the Captain:<br><br>&#160;&#160;&#160;""MY DEAR CAPTAIN BECUCCI:<br/>  <br/>  &#160;&#160;&#160;""Have the boy bring the skins at seven o'clock this evening, when I<br/>  &#160;&#160;&#160;shall be glad to look at them.

No skins, no tangible return; and evidently he is set on receiving that tangible return.<br><br>At seven o'clock Eliceo was back, but without leopard skins. He handed me this letter:<br><br>&#160;&#160;&#160;""SENOR LONDON:<br/>  <br/>  &#160;&#160;&#160;""I wish to instil in you the belief that I lost to-day, at half past<br/>  &#160;&#160;&#160;three in the afternoon, the key to my cubicle.

37,Shorty Dreams,"    ""Funny you don't gamble none,"" Shorty said to Smoke one night in the  Elkhorn.  ""Ain't it in your blood?""<br><br>    ""It is,"" Smoke answered.  ""But the statistics are in my head.  I  like an even break for my money.""<br><br>    All about them, in the huge bar-room, arose the click and rattle and  rumble of a dozen games, at which fur-clad, moccasined men tried  their luck.  Smoke waved his hand to include them all.<br><br>    ""Look at them,"" he said.  ""It's cold mathematics that they will lose  more than they win to-night, that the big proportion is losing right  now.""<br><br>    ""You're sure strong on figgers,"" Shorty murmured admiringly.  ""An'  in the main you're right.  But they's such a thing as facts.  An'  one fact is streaks of luck.  They's times when every geezer playin'  wins, as I know, for I've sat in in such games an' saw more'n one  bank busted.  The only way to win at gamblin' is wait for a hunch  that you've got a lucky streak comin' and then to play it to the  roof.""<br><br>    ""It sounds simple,"" Smoke criticized.  ""So simple I can't see how  men can lose.""<br><br>    ""The trouble is,"" Shorty admitted, ""that most men gets fooled on  their hunches.  On occasion I sure get fooled on mine.  The thing is  to try, an' find out.""<br><br>    Smoke shook his head.<br><br>    ""That's a statistic, too, Shorty.  Most men prove wrong on their  hunches.""<br><br>    ""But don't you ever get one of them streaky feelin's that all you  got to do is put your money down an' pick a winner?""<br><br>    Smoke laughed.<br><br>    ""I'm too scared of the percentage against me.  But I'll tell you  what, Shorty.  I'll throw a dollar on the 'high card' right now and  see if it will buy us a drink.""<br><br>    Smoke was edging his way in to the faro table, when Shorty caught  his arm.<br><br>    ""Hold on.  I'm gettin' one of them hunches now.  You put that dollar  on roulette.""<br><br>    They went over to a roulette table near the bar.<br><br>    ""Wait till I give the word,"" Shorty counselled.<br><br>    ""What number?"" Smoke asked.<br><br>    ""Pick it yourself.  But wait till I say let her go.""<br><br>    ""You don't mean to say I've got an even chance on that table?"" Smoke  argued.<br><br>    ""As good as the next geezers.""<br><br>    ""But not as good as the bank's.""<br><br>    ""Wait and see,"" Shorty urged.  ""Now!  Let her go!""<br><br>    The game-keeper had just sent the little ivory ball whirling around  the smooth rim above the revolving, many-slotted wheel.  Smoke, at  the lower end of the table, reached over a player, and blindly  tossed the dollar.  It slid along the smooth, green cloth and  stopped fairly in the centre of '34.'<br><br>    The ball came to rest, and the game-keeper announced, ""Thirty-four  wins!""  He swept the table, and alongside of Smoke's dollar, stacked  thirty-five dollars.  Smoke drew the money in, and Shorty slapped  him on the shoulder.<br><br>    ""Now, that was the real goods of a hunch, Smoke!  How'd I know it?  There's no tellin'.  I just knew you'd win.  Why, if that dollar of  yourn'd fell on any other number it'd won just the same.  When the  hunch is right, you just can't help winnin'.""<br><br>    ""Suppose it had come 'double nought'?"" Smoke queried, as they made  their way to the bar.<br><br>    ""Then your dollar'd ben on 'double nought,'"" was Shorty's answer.  ""They's no gettin' away from it.  A hunch is a hunch.  Here's how.  Come on back to the table.  I got a hunch, after pickin' you for a  winner, that I can pick some few numbers myself.""<br><br>    ""Are you playing a system?"" Smoke asked, at the end of ten minutes,  when his partner had dropped a hundred dollars.<br><br>    Shorty shook his head indignantly, as he spread his chips out in the  vicinities of '3,' '11,' and '17,' and tossed a spare chip on the  'green.'<br><br>    ""Hell is sure cluttered with geezers that played systems,"" he  exposited, as the keeper raked the table.<br><br>    From idly watching, Smoke became fascinated, following closely every  detail of the game from the whirling of the ball to the making and  the paying of the bets.  He made no plays, however, merely  contenting himself with looking on.  Yet so interested was he, that  Shorty, announcing that he had had enough, with difficulty drew  Smoke away from the table.  The game-keeper returned Shorty the gold  sack he had deposited as a credential for playing, and with it went  a slip of paper on which was scribbled, ""Out . . . 350 dollars.""  Shorty carried the sack and the paper across the room and handed  them to the weigher, who sat behind a large pair of gold-scales.  Out of Shorty's sack he weighed 350 dollars, which he poured into  the coffer of the house.<br><br>    ""That hunch of yours was another one of those statistics,"" Smoke  jeered.<br><br>    ""I had to play it, didn't I, in order to find out?"" Shorty retorted.  ""I reckon I was crowdin' some just on account of tryin' to convince  you they's such a thing as hunches.""<br><br>    ""Never mind, Shorty,"" Smoke laughed. ""I've got a hunch right now--""<br><br>    Shorty's eyes sparkled as he cried eagerly:  ""What is it?  Kick in  an' play it pronto.""<br><br>    ""It's not that kind, Shorty.  Now, what I've got is a hunch that  some day I'll work out a system that will beat the spots off that  table.""<br><br>    ""System!"" Shorty groaned, then surveyed his partner with a vast  pity.  ""Smoke, listen to your side-kicker an' leave system alone.  Systems is sure losers.  They ain't no hunches in systems.""<br><br>    ""That's why I like them,"" Smoke answered.  ""A system is statistical.  When you get the right system you can't lose, and that's the  difference between it and a hunch.  You never know when the right  hunch is going wrong.""<br><br>    ""But I know a lot of systems that went wrong, an' I never seen a  system win.""  Shorty paused and sighed.  ""Look here, Smoke, if  you're gettin' cracked on systems this ain't no place for you, an'  it's about time we hit the trail again.""<br><br>    <b>II.</b><br><br>    During the several following weeks, the two partners played at cross  purposes.  Smoke was bent on spending his time watching the roulette  game in the Elkhorn, while Shorty was equally bent on travelling  trail.  At last Smoke put his foot down when a stampede was proposed  for two hundred miles down the Yukon.<br><br>    ""Look here, Shorty,"" he said, ""I'm not going.  That trip will take  ten days, and before that time I hope to have my system in proper  working order.  I could almost win with it now.  What are you  dragging me around the country this way for anyway?""<br><br>    ""Smoke, I got to take care of you,"" was Shorty's reply.  ""You're  getting nutty.  I'd drag you stampedin' to Jericho or the North Pole  if I could keep you away from that table.""<br><br>    ""It's all right, Shorty.  But just remember I've reached full man-  grown, meat-eating size.  The only dragging you'll do, will be  dragging home the dust I'm going to win with that system of mine,  and you'll most likely have to do it with a dog-team.""<br><br>    Shorty's response was a groan.<br><br>    ""And I don't want you to be bucking any games on your own,"" Smoke  went on.  ""We're going to divide the winnings, and I'll need all our  money to get started.  That system's young yet, and it's liable to  trip me for a few falls before I get it lined up.""<br><br>    <b>III.</b><br><br>    At last, after long hours and days spent at watching the table, the  night came when Smoke proclaimed he was ready, and Shorty, glum and  pessimistic, with all the seeming of one attending a funeral,  accompanied his partner to the Elkhorn.  Smoke bought a stack of  chips and stationed himself at the game-keeper's end of the table.  Again and again the ball was whirled and the other players won or  lost, but Smoke did not venture a chip.  Shorty waxed impatient.<br><br>    ""Buck in, buck in,"" he urged.  ""Let's get this funeral over.  What's  the matter?  Got cold feet?""<br><br>    Smoke shook his head and waited.  A dozen plays went by, and then,  suddenly, he placed ten one-dollar chips on '26.'  The number won,  and the keeper paid Smoke three hundred and fifty dollars.  A dozen  plays went by, twenty plays, and thirty, when Smoke placed ten  dollars on '32.'  Again he received three hundred and fifty dollars.<br><br>    ""It's a hunch.""  Shorty whispered vociferously in his ear.  ""Ride  it!  Ride it!""<br><br>    Half an hour went by, during which Smoke was inactive, then he  placed ten dollars on '34' and won.<br><br>    ""A hunch!"" Shorty whispered.<br><br>    ""Nothing of the sort,"" Smoke whispered back.  ""It's the system.  Isn't she a dandy?""<br><br>    ""You can't tell me,"" Shorty contended.  ""Hunches comes in mighty  funny ways.  You might think it's a system, but it ain't.  Systems  is impossible.  They can't happen.  It's a sure hunch you're  playin'.""<br><br>    Smoke now altered his play.  He bet more frequently, with single  chips, scattered here and there, and he lost more often than he won.<br><br>    ""Quit it,"" Shorty advised.  ""Cash in.  You've rung the bull's eye  three times, an' you're ahead a thousand.  You can't keep it up.""<br><br>    At this moment the ball started whirling, and Smoke dropped ten  chips on '26.'  The ball fell into the slot of '26,' and the keeper  again paid him three hundred and fifty dollars.  ""If you're plum  crazy an' got the immortal cinch, bet'm the limit,"" Shorty said.  ""Put down twenty-five next time.""<br><br>    A quarter of an hour passed, during which Smoke won and lost on  small scattering bets.  Then, with the abruptness that characterized  his big betting, he placed twenty-five dollars on the 'double  nought,' and the keeper paid him eight hundred and seventy-five  dollars.<br><br>    ""Wake me up, Smoke, I'm dreamin',"" Shorty moaned.<br><br>    Smoke smiled, consulted his note-book, and became absorbed in  calculation.  He continually drew the note-book from his pocket, and  from time to time jotted down figures.<br><br>    A crowd had packed densely around the table, while the players  themselves were attempting to cover the same numbers he covered.  It  was then that a change came over his play.  Ten times in succession  he placed ten dollars on '18' and lost.  At this stage he was  deserted by the hardiest.  He changed his number and won another  three hundred and fifty dollars.  Immediately the players were back  with him, deserting again after a series of losing bets.<br><br>    ""Quit it, Smoke, quit it,"" Shorty advised.  ""The longest string of  hunches is only so long, an' your string's finished.  No more  bull's-eyes for you.""<br><br>    ""I'm going to ring her once again before I cash in,"" Smoke answered.<br><br>    For a few minutes, with varying luck, he played scattering chips  over the table, and then dropped twenty-five dollars on the 'double  nought.'<br><br>    ""I'll take my slip now,"" he said to the dealer, as he won.<br><br>    ""Oh, you don't need to show it to me,"" Shorty said, as they walked  to the weigher.  ""I ben keepin' track.  You're something like  thirty-six hundred to the good.  How near am I?""<br><br>    ""Thirty-six-thirty,"" Smoke replied.  ""And now you've got to pack the  dust home.  That was the agreement.""<br><br>    <b>IV.</b><br><br>    ""Don't crowd your luck,"" Shorty pleaded with Smoke, the next night,  in the cabin, as he evidenced preparations to return to the Elkhorn.  ""You played a mighty long string of hunches, but you played it out.  If you go back you'll sure drop all your winnings.""<br><br>    ""But I tell you it isn't hunches, Shorty.  It's statistics.  It's a  system.  It can't lose.""<br><br>    ""System be damned.  They ain't no such a thing as system.  I made  seventeen straight passes at a crap table once.  Was it system?  Nope.  It was fool luck, only I had cold feet an' didn't dast let it  ride.  It it'd rid, instead of me drawin' down after the third pass,  I'd a won over thirty thousan' on the original two-bit piece.""<br><br>    ""Just the same, Shorty, this is a real system.""<br><br>    ""Huh!  You got to show me.""<br><br>    ""I did show you.  Come on with me now and I'll show you again.""<br><br>    When they entered the Elkhorn, all eyes centred on Smoke, and those  about the table made way for him as he took up his old place at the  keeper's end.  His play was quite unlike that of the previous night.  In the course of an hour and a half he made only four bets, but each  bet was for twenty-five dollars, and each bet won.  He cashed in  thirty-five hundred dollars, and Shorty carried the dust home to the  cabin.<br><br>    ""Now's the time to jump the game,"" Shorty advised, as he sat on the  edge of his bunk and took off his moccasins.  ""You're seven thousan'  ahead.  A man's a fool that'd crowd his luck harder.""<br><br>    ""Shorty, a man would be a blithering lunatic if he didn't keep on  backing a winning system like mine.""<br><br>    ""Smoke, you're a sure bright boy.  You're college-learnt.  You know  more'n a minute than I could know in forty thousan' years.  But just  the same you're dead wrong when you call your luck a system.  I've  ben around some, an' seen a few, an' I tell you straight an'  confidential an' all-assurin', a system to beat a bankin' game ain't  possible.""<br><br>    ""But I'm showing you this one.  It's a pipe.""<br><br>    ""No, you're not, Smoke.  It's a pipe-dream.  I'm asleep.  Bime by  I'll wake up, an' build the fire, an' start breakfast.""<br><br>    ""Well, my unbelieving friend, there's the dust.  Heft it.""<br><br>    So saying, Smoke tossed the bulging gold-sack upon his partner's  knees.  It weighed thirty-five pounds, and Shorty was fully aware of  the crush of its impact on his flesh.<br><br>    ""It's real,"" Smoke hammered his point home.<br><br>    ""Huh!  I've saw some mighty real dreams in my time.  In a dream all  things is possible.  In real life a system ain't possible.  Now, I  ain't never ben to college, but I'm plum justified in sizin' up this  gamblin' orgy of ourn as a sure enough dream.""<br><br>    ""Hamilton's 'Law of Parsimony,'"" Smoke laughed.<br><br>    ""I ain't never heard of the geezer, but his dope's sure right.  I'm  dreamin', Smoke, an' you're just snoopin' around in my dream an'  tormentin' me with system.  If you love me, if you sure do love me,  you'll just yell, 'Shorty!  Wake up!'  An' I'll wake up an' start  breakfast.""<br><br>    <b>V.</b><br><br>    The third night of play, as Smoke laid his first bet, the game-  keeper shoved fifteen dollars back to him.<br><br>    ""Ten's all you can play,"" he said.  ""The limit's come down.""<br><br>    ""Gettin' picayune,"" Shorty sneered.<br><br>    ""No one has to play at this table that don't want to,"" the keeper  retorted.  ""And I'm willing to say straight out in meeting that we'd  sooner your pardner didn't play at our table.""<br><br>    ""Scared of his system, eh?"" Shorty challenged, as the keeper paid  over three hundred and fifty dollars.<br><br>    ""I ain't saying I believe in system, because I don't.  There never  was a system that'd beat roulette or any percentage game.  But just  the same I've seen some queer strings of luck, and I ain't going to  let this bank go bust if I can help it.""<br><br>    ""Cold feet.""<br><br>    ""Gambling is just as much business, my friend, as any other  business.  We ain't philanthropists.""<br><br>    Night by night, Smoke continued to win.  His method of play varied.  Expert after expert, in the jam about the table, scribbled down his  bets and numbers in vain attempts to work out his system.  They  complained of their inability to get a clew to start with, and swore  that it was pure luck, though the most colossal streak of it they  had ever seen.<br><br>    It was Smoke's varied play that obfuscated them.  Sometimes,  consulting his note-book or engaging in long calculations, an hour  elapsed without his staking a chip.  At other times he would win  three limit-bets and clean up a thousand dollars and odd in five or  ten minutes.  At still other times, his tactics would be to scatter  single chips prodigally and amazingly over the table.  This would  continue for from ten to thirty minutes of play, when, abruptly, as  the ball whirled through the last few of its circles, he would play  the limit on column, colour, and number, and win all three.  Once,  to complete confusion in the minds of those that strove to divine  his secret, he lost forty straight bets, each at the limit.  But  each night, play no matter how diversely, Shorty carried home  thirty-five hundred dollars for him.<br><br>    ""It ain't no system,"" Shorty expounded at one of their bed-going  discussions.  ""I follow you, an' follow you, but they ain't no  figgerin' it out.  You never play twice the same.  All you do is  pick winners when you want to, an' when you don't want to, you just  on purpose don't.""<br><br>    ""Maybe you're nearer right than you think, Shorty.  I've just got to  pick losers sometimes.  It's part of the system.""<br><br>    ""System--hell!  I've talked with every gambler in town, an' the last  one is agreed they ain't no such thing as system.""<br><br>    ""Yet I'm showing them one all the time.""<br><br>    ""Look here, Smoke.""  Shorty paused over the candle, in the act of  blowing it out.  ""I'm real irritated.  Maybe you think this is a  candle.  It ain't.  An' this ain't me neither.  I'm out on trail  somewheres, in my blankets, lyin' on my back with my mouth open, an'  dreamin' all this.  That ain't you talkin', any more than this  candle is a candle.""<br><br>    ""It's funny, how I happen to be dreaming along with you then,"" Smoke  persisted.<br><br>    ""No, it ain't.  You're part of my dream, that's all.  I've hearn  many a man talk in my dreams.  I want to tell you one thing, Smoke.  I'm gettin' mangy an' mad.  If this here dream keeps up much more  I'm goin' to bite my veins an' howl.""<br><br>    <b>VI.</b><br><br>    On the sixth night of play at the Elkhorn, the limit was reduced to  five dollars.<br><br>    ""It's all right,"" Smoke assured the game-keeper.  ""I want thirty-  five hundred to-night, as usual, and you only compel me to play  longer.  I've got to pick twice as many winners, that's all.""<br><br>    ""Why don't you buck somebody else's table?"" the keeper demanded  wrathfully.<br><br>    ""Because I like this one."" Smoke glanced over to the roaring stove  only a few feet away.  ""Besides, there are no draughts here, and it  is warm and comfortable.""<br><br>    On the ninth night, when Shorty had carried the dust home, he had a  fit.<br><br>    ""I quit, Smoke, I quit,"" he began.  ""I know when I got enough.  I  ain't dreamin'.  I'm wide awake.  A system can't be, but you got one  just the same.  There's nothin' in the rule o' three.  The almanac's  clean out.  The world's gone smash.  There's nothin' regular an'  uniform no more.  The multiplication table's gone loco.  Two is  eight, nine is eleven, and two-times-six is eight hundred an' forty-  six--an'--an' a half.  Anything is everything, an' nothing's all,  an' twice all is cold cream, milk-shakes, an' calico horses.  You've  got a system.  Figgers beat the figgerin'.  What ain't is, an' what  isn't has to be.  The sun rises in the west, the moon's a paystreak,  the stars is canned corn-beef, scurvy's the blessin' of God, him  that dies kicks again, rocks floats, water's gas, I ain't me, you're  somebody else, an' mebbe we're twins if we ain't hashed-brown  potatoes fried in verdigris.  Wake me up!  Somebody!  Oh!  Wake me  up!""<br><br>    <b>VII.</b><br><br>    The next morning a visitor came to the cabin.  Smoke knew him,  Harvey Moran, the owner of all the games in the Tivoli.  There was a  note of appeal in his deep gruff voice as he plunged into his  business.<br><br>    ""It's like this, Smoke,"" he began.  ""You've got us all guessing.  I'm representing nine other game-owners and myself from all the  saloons in town.  We don't understand.  We know that no system ever  worked against roulette.  All the mathematic sharps in the colleges  have told us gamblers the same thing.  They say that roulette itself  is the system, the one and only system, and, therefore, that no  system can beat it, for that would mean arithmetic has gone bug-  house.""<br><br>    Shorty nodded his head violently.<br><br>    ""If a system can beat a system, then there's no such thing as  system,"" the gambler went on.  ""In such a case anything could be  possible--a thing could be in two different places at once, or two  things could be in the same place that's only large enough for one  at the same time.""<br><br>    ""Well, you've seen me play,"" Smoke answered defiantly; ""and if you  think it's only a string of luck on my part, why worry?""<br><br>    ""That's the trouble.  We can't help worrying.  It's a system you've  got, and all the time we know it can't be.  I've watched you five  nights now, and all I can make out is that you favour certain  numbers and keep on winning.  Now the ten of us game-owners have got  together, and we want to make a friendly proposition.  We'll put a  roulette table in a back room of the Elkhorn, pool the bank against  you, and have you buck us.  It will be all quiet and private.  Just  you and Shorty and us.  What do you say?""<br><br>    ""I think it's the other way around,"" Smoke answered.  ""It's up to  you to come and see me.  I'll be playing in the bar-room of the  Elkhorn to-night.  You can watch me there just as well.""<br><br>    <b>VIII.</b><br><br>    That night, when Smoke took up his customary place at the table, the  keeper shut down the game.<br><br>    ""The game's closed,"" he said.  ""Boss's orders.""<br><br>    But the assembled game-owners were not to be balked.  In a few  minutes they arranged a pool, each putting in a thousand, and took  over the table.<br><br>    ""Come on and buck us,"" Harvey Moran challenged, as the keeper sent  the ball on its first whirl around.<br><br>    ""Give me the twenty-five limit,"" Smoke suggested.<br><br>    ""Sure; go to it.""<br><br>    Smoke immediately placed twenty-five chips on the 'double nought,'  and won.<br><br>    Moran wiped the sweat from his forehead.<br><br>    ""Go on,"" he said.  ""We got ten thousand in this bank.""<br><br>    At the end of an hour and a half, the ten thousand was Smoke's.<br><br>    ""The bank's bust,"" the keeper announced.<br><br>    ""Got enough?"" Smoke asked.<br><br>    The game-owners looked at one another.  They were awed.  They, the  fatted proteges of the laws of chance, were undone.  They were up  against one who had more intimate access to those laws, or who had  invoked higher and undreamed laws.<br><br>    ""We quit,"" Moran said.  ""Ain't that right, Burke?""<br><br>    Big Burke, who owned the games in the M. and G. Saloon, nodded.<br><br>    ""The impossible has happened,"" he said.  ""This Smoke here has got a  system all right.  If we let him go on we'll all bust.  All I can  see, if we're goin' to keep our tables running, is to cut down the  limit to a dollar, or to ten cents, or a cent.  He won't win much in  a night with such stakes.""<br><br>    All looked at Smoke.  He shrugged his shoulders.<br><br>    ""In that case, gentlemen, I'll have to hire a gang of men to play at  all your tables.  I can pay them ten dollars for a four-hour shift  and make money.""<br><br>    ""Then we'll shut down our tables,"" Big Burke replied.  ""Unless--""  He hesitated and ran his eye over his fellows to see that they were  with him.  ""Unless you're willing to talk business.  What will you  sell the system for?""<br><br>    ""Thirty thousand dollars,"" Smoke answered.  ""That's a tax of three  thousand apiece.""<br><br>    They debated and nodded.<br><br>    ""And you'll tell us your system?""<br><br>    ""Surely.""<br><br>    ""And you'll promise not to play roulette in Dawson ever again?""<br><br>    ""No, sir,"" Smoke said positively.  ""I'll promise not to play this  system again.""<br><br>    ""My God!"" Moran exploded.  ""You haven't got other systems, have  you?""<br><br>    ""Hold on!"" Shorty cried.  ""I want to talk to my pardner.  Come over  here, Smoke, on the side.""<br><br>    Smoke followed into a quiet corner of the room, while hundreds of  curious eyes centred on him and Shorty.<br><br>    ""Look here, Smoke,"" Shorty whispered hoarsely.  ""Mebbe it ain't a  dream.  In which case you're sellin' out almighty cheap.  You've  sure got the world by the slack of its pants.  They's millions in  it.  Shake it!  Shake it hard!""<br><br>    ""But if it's a dream?"" Smoke queried softly.<br><br>    ""Then, for the sake of the dream an' the love of Mike, stick them  gamblers up good and plenty.  What's the good of dreamin' if you  can't dream to the real right, dead sure, eternal finish?""<br><br>    ""Fortunately, this isn't a dream, Shorty.""<br><br>    ""Then if you sell out for thirty thousan', I'll never forgive you.""<br><br>    ""When I sell out for thirty thousand, you'll fall on my neck an'  wake up to find out that you haven't been dreaming at all.  This is  no dream, Shorty.  In about two minutes you'll see you have been  wide awake all the time.  Let me tell you that when I sell out it's  because I've got to sell out.""<br><br>    Back at the table, Smoke informed the game-owners that his offer  still held.  They proffered him their paper to the extent of three  thousand each.<br><br>    ""Hold out for the dust,"" Shorty cautioned.<br><br>    ""I was about to intimate that I'd take the money weighed out,"" Smoke  said.<br><br>    The owner of the Elkhorn cashed their paper, and Shorty took  possession of the gold-dust.<br><br>    ""Now, I don't want to wake up,"" he chortled, as he hefted the  various sacks.  ""Toted up, it's a seventy thousan' dream.  It's be  too blamed expensive to open my eyes, roll out of the blankets, an'  start breakfast.""<br><br>    ""What's your system?"" Big Burke demanded.  ""We've paid for it, and  we want it.""<br><br>    Smoke led the way to the table.<br><br>    ""Now, gentlemen, bear with me a moment.  This isn't an ordinary  system.  It can scarcely be called legitimate, but its one great  virtue is that it works.  I've got my suspicious, but I'm not saying  anything.  You watch.  Mr Keeper, be ready with the ball.  Wait, I  am going to pick '26.'  Consider I've bet on it.  Be ready, Mr  Keeper--Now!""<br><br>    The ball whirled around.<br><br>    ""You observe,"" Smoke went on, ""that '9' was directly opposite.""<br><br>    The ball finished in '26.'<br><br>    Big Burke swore deep in his chest, and all waited.<br><br>    ""For 'double nought' to win, '11' must be opposite.  Try it yourself  and see.""<br><br>    ""But the system?"" Moran demanded impatiently.  ""We know you can pick  winning numbers, and we know what those numbers are; but how do you  do it?""<br><br>    ""By observed sequences.  By accident I chanced twice to notice the  ball whirled when '9' was opposite.  Both times '26' won.  After  that I saw it happen again.  Then I looked for other sequences, and  found them.  'Double nought' opposite fetches '32,' and '11' fetches  'double nought.'  It doesn't always happen, but it USUALLY happens.  You notice, I say 'usually.'  As I said before, I have my  suspicions, but I'm not saying anything.""<br><br>    Big Burke, with a sudden dawn of comprehension reached over, stopped  the wheel, and examined it carefully.  The heads of the nine other  game-owners bent over and joined in the examination.  Big Burke  straightened up and cast a glance at the near-by stove.<br><br>    ""Hell,"" he said.  ""It wasn't any system at all.  The table stood  close to the fire, and the blamed wheel's warped.  And we've been  worked to a frazzle.  No wonder he liked this table.  He couldn't  have bucked for sour apples at any other table.""<br><br>    Harvey Moran gave a great sigh of relief and wiped his forehead.<br><br>    ""Well, anyway,"" he said, ""it's cheap at the price just to find out  that it wasn't a system.""  His face began to work, and then he broke  into laughter and slapped Smoke on the shoulder.  ""Smoke, you had us  going for a while, and we patting ourselves on the back because you  were letting our tables alone!  Say, I've got some real fizz I'll  open if all you'll come over to the Tivoli with me.""<br><br>    Later, back in the cabin, Shorty silently overhauled and hefted the  various bulging gold-sacks.  He finally piled them on the table, sat  down on the edge of his bunk, and began taking off his moccasins.<br><br>    ""Seventy thousan',"" he calculated.  ""It weighs three hundred and  fifty pounds.  And all out of a warped wheel an' a quick eye.  Smoke, you eat'm raw, you eat'm alive, you work under water, you've  given me the jim-jams; but just the same I know it's a dream.  It's  only in dreams that the good things comes true.  I'm almighty  unanxious to wake up.  I hope I never wake up.""<br><br>    ""Cheer up,"" Smoke answered.  ""You won't.  There are a lot of  philosophy sharps that think men are sleep-walkers.  You're in good  company.""<br><br>    Shorty got up, went to the table, selected the heaviest sack, and  cuddled it in his arms as if it were a baby.<br><br>    ""I may be sleep-walkin',"" he said, ""but as you say, I'm sure in  mighty good company.""  						                                      <br><br>"
38,That Spot,"I don't think much of Stephen Mackaye any more, though I used to  swear by him.  I know that in those days I loved him more than my own  brother.  If ever I meet Stephen Mackaye again, I shall not be  responsible for my actions.  It passes beyond me that a man with whom  I shared food and blanket, and with whom I mushed over the Chilcoot  Trail, should turn out the way he did.  I always sized Steve up as a  square man, a kindly comrade, without an iota of anything vindictive  or malicious in his nature.  I shall never trust my judgment in men  again.  Why, I nursed that man through typhoid fever; we starved  together on the headwaters of the Stewart; and he saved my life on  the Little Salmon.  And now, after the years we were together, all I  can say of Stephen Mackaye is that he is the meanest man I ever knew.    <br><br>We started for the Klondike in the fall rush of 1897, and we started  too late to get over Chilcoot Pass before the freeze-up.  We packed  our outfit on our backs part way over, when the snow began to fly,  and then we had to buy dogs in order to sled it the rest of the way.  That was how we came to get that Spot.  Dogs were high, and we paid  one hundred and ten dollars for him.  He looked worth it.  I say  LOOKED, because he was one of the finest-appearing dogs I ever saw.  He weighed sixty pounds, and he had all the lines of a good sled  animal.  We never could make out his breed.  He wasn't husky, nor  Malemute, nor Hudson Bay; he looked like all of them and he didn't  look like any of them; and on top of it all he had some of the white  man's dog in him, for on one side, in the thick of the mixed yellow-  brown-red-and-dirty-white that was his prevailing colour, there was a  spot of coal-black as big as a water-bucket.  That was why we called  him Spot.      <br><br>He was a good looker all right.  When he was in condition his muscles  stood out in bunches all over him.  And he was the strongest-looking  brute I ever saw in Alaska, also the most intelligent-looking.  To  run your eves over him, you'd think he could outpull three dogs of  his own weight.  Maybe he could, but I never saw it.  His  intelligence didn't run that way.  He could steal and forage to  perfection; he had an instinct that was positively gruesome for  divining when work was to be done and for making a sneak accordingly;  and for getting lost and not staying lost he was nothing short of  inspired.  But when it came to work, the way that intelligence  dribbled out of him and left him a mere clot of wobbling, stupid  jelly would make your heart bleed.    <br><br>There are times when I think it wasn't stupidity.  Maybe, like some  men I know, he was too wise to work.  I shouldn't wonder if he put it  all over us with that intelligence of his.  Maybe he figured it all  out and decided that a licking now and again and no work was a whole  lot better than work all the time and no licking.  He was intelligent  enough for such a computation.  I tell you, I've sat and looked into  that dog's eyes till the shivers ran up and down my spine and the  marrow crawled like yeast, what of the intelligence I saw shining  out.  I can't express myself about that intelligence.  It is beyond  mere words.  I saw it, that's all.  At times it was like gazing into  a human soul, to look into his eyes; and what I saw there frightened  me and started all sorts of ideas in my own mind of reincarnation and  all the rest.  I tell you I sensed something big in that brute's  eyes; there was a message there, but I wasn't big enough myself to  catch it.  Whatever it was (I know I'm making a fool of myself)--  whatever it was, it baffled me.  I can't give an inkling of what I  saw in that brute's eyes; it wasn't light, it wasn't colour; it was  something that moved, away back, when the eyes themselves weren't  moving.  And I guess I didn't see it move either; I only sensed that  it moved.  It was an expression--that's what it was--and I got an  impression of it.  No; it was different from a mere expression; it  was more than that.  I don't know what it was, but it gave me a  feeling of kinship just the same.  Oh, no, not sentimental kinship.  It was, rather, a kinship of equality.  Those eyes never pleaded like  a deer's eyes.  They challenged.  No, it wasn't defiance.  It was  just a calm assumption of equality.  And I don't think it was  deliberate.  My belief is that it was unconscious on his part.  It  was there because it was there, and it couldn't help shining out.  No, I don't mean shine.  It didn't shine; it MOVED.  I know I'm  talking rot, but if you'd looked into that animal's eyes the way I  have, you'd understand.  Steve was affected the same way I was.  Why,  I tried to kill that Spot once--he was no good for anything; and I  fell down on it.  I led him out into the brush, and he came along  slow and unwilling.  He knew what was going on.  I stopped in a  likely place, put my foot on the rope, and pulled my big Colt's.  And  that dog sat down and looked at me.  I tell you he didn't plead.  He  just looked.  And I saw all kinds of incomprehensible things moving,  yes, MOVING, in those eyes of his.  I didn't really see them move; I  thought I saw them, for, as I said before, I guess I only sensed  them.  And I want to tell you right now that it got beyond me.  It  was like killing a man, a conscious, brave man, who looked calmly  into your gun as much as to say, ""Who's afraid?""      <br><br>Then, too, the message seemed so near that, instead of pulling the  trigger quick, I stopped to see if I could catch the message.  There  it was, right before me, glimmering all around in those eyes of his.  And then it was too late.  I got scared.  I was trembly all over, and  my stomach generated a nervous palpitation that made me seasick.  I  just sat down and looked at the dog, and he looked at me, till I  thought I was going crazy.  Do you want to know what I did?  I threw  down the gun and ran back to camp with the fear of God in my heart.  Steve laughed at me.  But I notice that Steve led Spot into the  woods, a week later, for the same purpose, and that Steve came back  alone, and a little later Spot drifted back, too.    <br><br>At any rate, Spot wouldn't work.  We paid a hundred and ten dollars  for him from the bottom of our sack, and he wouldn't work.  He  wouldn't even tighten the traces.  Steve spoke to him the first time  we put him in harness, and he sort of shivered, that was all.  Not an  ounce on the traces.  He just stood still and wobbled, like so much  jelly.  Steve touched him with the whip.  He yelped, but not an  ounce.  Steve touched him again, a bit harder, and he howled--the  regular long wolf howl.  Then Steve got mad and gave him half a  dozen, and I came on the run from the tent.      <br><br>I told Steve he was brutal with the animal, and we had some words--  the first we'd ever had.  He threw the whip down in the snow and  walked away mad.  I picked it up and went to it.  That Spot trembled  and wobbled and cowered before ever I swung the lash, and with the  first bite of it he howled like a lost soul.  Next he lay down in the  snow.  I started the rest of the dogs, and they dragged him along  while I threw the whip into him.  He rolled over on his back and  bumped along, his four legs waving in the air, himself howling as  though he was going through a sausage machine.  Steve came back and  laughed at me, and I apologized for what I'd said.    <br><br>There was no getting any work out of that Spot; and to make up for  it, he was the biggest pig-glutton of a dog I ever saw.  On top of  that, he was the cleverest thief.  There was no circumventing him.  Many a breakfast we went without our bacon because Spot had been  there first.  And it was because of him that we nearly starved to  death up the Stewart.  He figured out the way to break into our meat-  cache, and what he didn't eat, the rest of the team did.  But he was  impartial.  He stole from everybody.  He was a restless dog, always  very busy snooping around or going somewhere.  And there was never a  camp within five miles that he didn't raid.  The worst of it was that  they always came back on us to pay his board bill, which was just,  being the law of the land; but it was mighty hard on us, especially  that first winter on the Chilcoot, when we were busted, paying for  whole hams and sides of bacon that we never ate.  He could fight,  too, that Spot.  He could do everything but work.  He never pulled a  pound, but he was the boss of the whole team.  The way he made those  dogs stand around was an education.  He bullied them, and there was  always one or more of them fresh-marked with his fangs.  But he was  more than a bully.  He wasn't afraid of anything that walked on four  legs; and I've seen him march, single-handed into a strange team,  without any provocation whatever, and put the kibosh on the whole  outfit.  Did I say he could eat?  I caught him eating the whip once.  That's straight.  He started in at the lash, and when I caught him he  was down to the handle, and still going.      <br><br>But he was a good looker.  At the end of the first week we sold him  for seventy-five dollars to the Mounted Police.  They had experienced  dog-drivers, and we knew that by the time he'd covered the six  hundred miles to Dawson he'd be a good sled-dog.  I say we KNEW, for  we were just getting acquainted with that Spot.  A little later we  were not brash enough to know anything where he was concerned.  A  week later we woke up in the morning to the dangdest dog-fight we'd  ever heard.  It was that Spot come back and knocking the team into  shape.  We ate a pretty depressing breakfast, I can tell you; but  cheered up two hours afterward when we sold him to an official  courier, bound in to Dawson with government despatches.  That Spot  was only three days in coming back, and, as usual, celebrated his  arrival with a rough house.    <br><br>We spent the winter and spring, after our own outfit was across the  pass, freighting other people's outfits; and we made a fat stake.  Also, we made money out of Spot.  If we sold him once, we sold him  twenty times.  He always came back, and no one asked for their money.  We didn't want the money.  We'd have paid handsomely for any one to  take him off our hands for keeps'.  We had to get rid of him, and we  couldn't give him away, for that would have been suspicious.  But he  was such a fine looker that we never had any difficulty in selling  him.  ""Unbroke,"" we'd say, and they'd pay any old price for him.  We  sold him as low as twenty-five dollars, and once we got a hundred and  fifty for him.  That particular party returned him in person, refused  to take his money back, and the way he abused us was something awful.  He said it was cheap at the price to tell us what he thought of us;  and we felt he was so justified that we never talked back.  But to  this day I've never quite regained all the old self-respect that was  mine before that man talked to me.      <br><br>When the ice cleared out of the lakes and river, we put our outfit in  a Lake Bennett boat and started for Dawson.  We had a good team of  dogs, and of course we piled them on top the outfit.  That Spot was  along--there was no losing him; and a dozen times, the first day, he  knocked one or another of the dogs overboard in the course of  fighting with them.  It was close quarters, and he didn't like being  crowded.    <br><br>""What that dog needs is space,"" Steve said the second day.  ""Let's  maroon him.""      <br><br>We did, running the boat in at Caribou Crossing for him to jump  ashore.  Two of the other dogs, good dogs, followed him; and we lost  two whole days trying to find them.  We never saw those two dogs  again; but the quietness and relief we enjoyed made us decide, like  the man who refused his hundred and fifty, that it was cheap at the  price.  For the first time in months Steve and I laughed and whistled  and sang.  We were as happy as clams.  The dark days were over.  The  nightmare had been lifted.  That Spot was gone.    <br><br>Three weeks later, one morning, Steve and I were standing on the  river-bank at Dawson.  A small boat was just arriving from Lake  Bennett.  I saw Steve give a start, and heard him say something that  was not nice and that was not under his breath.  Then I looked; and  there, in the bow of the boat, with ears pricked up, sat Spot.  Steve  and I sneaked immediately, like beaten curs, like cowards, like  absconders from justice.  It was this last that the lieutenant of  police thought when he saw us sneaking.  He surmised that there were  law-officers in the boat who were after us.  He didn't wait to find  out, but kept us in sight, and in the M. & M. saloon got us in a  corner.  We had a merry time explaining, for we refused to go back to  the boat and meet Spot; and finally he held us under guard of another  policeman while he went to the boat.  After we got clear of him, we  started for the cabin, and when we arrived, there was that Spot  sitting on the stoop waiting for us.  Now how did he know we lived  there?  There were forty thousand people in Dawson that summer, and  how did he savve our cabin out of all the cabins?  How did he know we  were in Dawson, anyway?  I leave it to you.  But don't forget what I  said about his intelligence and that immortal something I have seen  glimmering in his eyes.      <br><br>There was no getting rid of him any more.  There were too many people  in Dawson who had bought him up on Chilcoot, and the story got  around.  Half a dozen times we put him on board steamboats going down  the Yukon; but he merely went ashore at the first landing and trotted  back up the bank.  We couldn't sell him, we couldn't kill him (both  Steve and I had tried), and nobody else was able to kill him.  He  bore a charmed life.  I've seen him go down in a dogfight on the main  street with fifty dogs on top of him, and when they were separated,  he'd appear on all his four legs, unharmed, while two of the dogs  that had been on top of him would be lying dead.    <br><br>I saw him steal a chunk of moose-meat from Major Dinwiddie's cache so  heavy that he could just keep one jump ahead of Mrs. Dinwiddie's  squaw cook, who was after him with an axe.  As he went up the hill,  after the squaw gave up, Major Dinwiddie himself came out and pumped  his Winchester into the landscape.  He emptied his magazine twice,  and never touched that Spot.  Then a policeman came along and  arrested him for discharging firearms inside the city limits.  Major  Dinwiddie paid his fine, and Steve and I paid him for the moose-meat  at the rate of a dollar a pound, bones and all.  That was what he  paid for it.  Meat was high that year.      <br><br>I am only telling what I saw with my own eyes.  And now I'll tell you  something also.  I saw that Spot fall through a water-hole.  The ice  was three and a half feet thick, and the current sucked him under  like a straw.  Three hundred yards below was the big water-hole used  by the hospital.  Spot crawled out of the hospital water-hole, licked  off the water, bit out the ice that had formed between his toes,  trotted up the bank, and whipped a big Newfoundland belonging to the  Gold Commissioner.    <br><br>In the fall of 1898, Steve and I poled up the Yukon on the last  water, bound for Stewart River.  We took the dogs along, all except  Spot.  We figured we'd been feeding him long enough.  He'd cost us  more time and trouble and money and grub than we'd got by selling him  on the Chilcoot--especially grub.  So Steve and I tied him down in  the cabin and pulled our freight.  We camped that night at the mouth  of Indian River, and Steve and I were pretty facetious over having  shaken him.  Steve was a funny cuss, and I was just sitting up in the  blankets and laughing when a tornado hit camp.  The way that Spot  walked into those dogs and gave them what-for was hair-raising.  Now  how did he get loose?  It's up to you.  I haven't any theory.  And  how did he get across the Klondike River?  That's another facer.  And  anyway, how did he know we had gone up the Yukon?  You see, we went  by water, and he couldn't smell our tracks.  Steve and I began to get  superstitious about that dog.  He got on our nerves, too; and,  between you and me, we were just a mite afraid of him.      <br><br>The freeze-up came on when we were at the mouth of Henderson Creek,  and we traded him off for two sacks of flour to an outfit that was  bound up White River after copper.  Now that whole outfit was lost.  Never trace nor hide nor hair of men, dogs, sleds, or anything was  ever found.  They dropped clean out of sight.  It became one of the  mysteries of the country.  Steve and I plugged away up the Stewart,  and six weeks afterward that Spot crawled into camp.  He was a  perambulating skeleton, and could just drag along; but he got there.  And what I want to know is, who told him we were up the Stewart?  We  could have gone to a thousand other places.  How did he know?  You  tell me, and I'll tell you.    <br><br>No losing him.  At the Mayo he started a row with an Indian dog.  The  buck who owned the dog took a swing at Spot with an axe, missed him,  and killed his own dog.  Talk about magic and turning bullets aside--  I, for one, consider it a blamed sight harder to turn an axe aside  with a big buck at the other end of it.  And I saw him do it with my  own eyes.  That buck didn't want to kill his own dog.  You've got to  show me.      <br><br>I told you about Spot breaking into our meat cache.  It was nearly  the death of us.  There wasn't any more meat to be killed, and meat  was all we had to live on.  The moose had gone back several hundred  miles and the Indians with them.  There we were.  Spring was on, and  we had to wait for the river to break.  We got pretty thin before we  decided to eat the dogs, and we decided to eat Spot first.  Do you  know what that dog did?  He sneaked.  Now how did he know our minds  were made up to eat him?  We sat up nights laying for him, but he  never came back, and we ate the other dogs.  We ate the whole team.    <br><br>And now for the sequel.  You know what it is when a big river breaks  up and a few billion tons of ice go out, jamming and milling and  grinding.  Just in the thick of it, when the Stewart went out,  rumbling and roaring, we sighted Spot out in the middle.  He'd got  caught as he was trying to cross up above somewhere.  Steve and I  yelled and shouted and ran up and down the bank, tossing our hats in  the air.  Sometimes we'd stop and hug each other, we were that  boisterous, for we saw Spot's finish.  He didn't have a chance in a  million.  He didn't have any chance at all.  After the ice-run, we  got into a canoe and paddled down to the Yukon, and down the Yukon to  Dawson, stopping to feed up for a week at the cabins at the mouth of  Henderson Creek.  And as we came in to the bank at Dawson, there sat  that Spot, waiting for us, his ears pricked up, his tail wagging, his  mouth smiling, extending a hearty welcome to us.  Now how did he get  out of that ice?  How did he know we were coming to Dawson, to the  very hour and minute, to be out there on the bank waiting for us?      <br><br>The more I think of that Spot, the more I am convinced that there are  things in this world that go beyond science.  On no scientific  grounds can that Spot be explained.  It's psychic phenomena, or  mysticism, or something of that sort, I guess, with a lot of  Theosophy thrown in.  The Klondike is a good country.  I might have  been there yet, and become a millionaire, if it hadn't been for Spot.  He got on my nerves.  I stood him for two years altogether, and then  I guess my stamina broke.  It was the summer of 1899 when I pulled  out.  I didn't say anything to Steve.  I just sneaked.  But I fixed  it up all right.  I wrote Steve a note, and enclosed a package of  ""rough-on-rats,"" telling him what to do with it.  I was worn down to  skin and bone by that Spot, and I was that nervous that I'd jump and  look around when there wasn't anybody within hailing distance.  But  it was astonishing the way I recuperated when I got quit of him.  I  got back twenty pounds before I arrived in San Francisco, and by the  time I'd crossed the ferry to Oakland I was my old self again, so  that even my wife looked in vain for any change in me.    <br><br>Steve wrote to me once, and his letter seemed irritated.  He took it  kind of hard because I'd left him with Spot.  Also, he said he'd used  the ""rough-on-rats,"" per directions, and that there was nothing  doing.  A year went by.  I was back in the office and prospering in  all ways--even getting a bit fat.  And then Steve arrived.  He didn't  look me up.  I read his name in the steamer list, and wondered why.  But I didn't wonder long.  I got up one morning and found that Spot  chained to the gate-post and holding up the milkman.  Steve went  north to Seattle, I learned, that very morning.  I didn't put on any  more weight.  My wife made me buy him a collar and tag, and within an  hour he showed his gratitude by killing her pet Persian cat.  There  is no getting rid of that Spot.  He will be with me until I die, for  he'll never die.  My appetite is not so good since he arrived, and my  wife says I am looking peaked.  Last night that Spot got into Mr.  Harvey's hen-house (Harvey is my next-door neighbour) and killed  nineteen of his fancy-bred chickens.  I shall have to pay for them.  My neighbours on the other side quarrelled with my wife and then  moved out.  Spot was the cause of it.  And that is why I am  disappointed in Stephen Mackaye.  I had no idea he was so mean a man.                             <br><br>"
39,The Benefit of the Doubt,"CARTER WATSON, a current magazine under his arm, strolled  slowly along, gazing about him curiously. Twenty years had  elapsed since he had been on this particular street, and the  changes were great and stupefying. This Western city of three  hundred thousand souls had contained but thirty thousand, when,  as a boy, he had been wont to ramble along its streets. In  those days the street he was now on had been a quiet residence  street in the respectable workingclass quarter. On this late  afternoon he found that it had been submerged by a vast and  vicious tenderloin. Chinese and Japanese shops and dens  abounded, all confusedly intermingled with low white resorts  and boozing dens. This quiet street of his youth had become the  toughest quarter of the city.<br><br>    He looked at his watch. It was half-past five. It was the slack  time of the day in such a region, as he well knew, yet he was  curious to see. In all his score of years of wandering and  studying social conditions over the world, he had carried with  him the memory of his old town as a sweet and wholesome place.  The metamorphosis he now beheld was startling. He certainly  must continue his stroll and glimpse the infamy to which his  town had descended.<br><br>    Another thing: Carter Watson had a keen social and civic  consciousness. Independently wealthy, he had been loath to  dissipate his energies in the pink teas and freak dinners of  society, while actresses, race-horses, and kindred diversions  had left him cold. He had the ethical bee in his bonnet and was  a reformer of no mean pretension, though his work had been  mainly in the line of contributions to the heavier reviews and  quarterlies and to the publication over his name of brightly,  cleverly written books on the working classes and the  slum-dwellers. Among the twenty-seven to his credit occurred  titles such as, ""If Christ Came to New Orleans,"" "" The  Worked-out Worker,"" ""Tenement Reform in Berlin,"" ""The Rural  Slums of England,"" ""The people of the East Side,"" ""Reform  Versus Revolution,"" ""The University Settlement as a Hot Bed of  Radicalism' and ""The Cave Man of Civilization.""<br><br>    But Carter Watson was neither morbid nor fanatic. He did not  lose his head over the horrors he encountered, studied, and  exposed. No hair brained enthusiasm branded him. His humor  saved him, as did his wide experience and his con. conservative  philosophic temperament. Nor did he have any patience with  lightning change reform theories. As he saw it, society would  grow better only through the painfully slow and arduously  painful processes of evolution. There were no short cuts, no  sudden regenerations. The betterment of mankind must be worked  out in agony and misery just as all past social betterments had  been worked out.<br><br>    But on this late summer afternoon, Carter Watson was curious.  As he moved along he paused before a gaudy drinking place. The  sign above read, ""The Vendome."" There were two entrances. One  evidently led to the bar. This he did not explore. The other  was a narrow hallway. Passing through this he found himself in  a huge room, filled with chair-encircled tables and quite  deserted. In the dim light he made out a piano in the distance.  Making a mental note that he would come back some time and  study the class of persons that must sit and drink at those  multitudinous tables, he proceeded to circumnavigate the room.<br><br>    Now, at the rear, a short hallway led off to a small kitchen,  and here, at a table, alone, sat Patsy Horan, proprietor of the  Vendome, consuming a hasty supper ere the evening rush of  business. Also, Patsy Horan was angry with the world. He had  got out of the wrong side of bed that morning, and nothing had  gone right all day. Had his barkeepers been asked, they would  have described his mental condition as a grouch. But Carter  Watson did not know this. As he passed the little hallway,  Patsy Horan's sullen eyes lighted on the magazine he carried  under his arm. Patsy did not know Carter Watson, nor did he  know that what he carried under his arm was a magazine. Patsy,  out of the depths of his grouch, decided that this stranger was  one of those pests who marred and scarred the walls of his back  rooms by tacking up or pasting up advertisements. The color on  the front cover of the magazine convinced him that it was such  an advertisement. Thus the trouble began. Knife and fork in  hand, Patsy leaped for Carter Watson.<br><br>    ""Out wid yeh!"" Patsy bellowed. ""I know yer game!""<br><br>    Carter Watson was startled. The man had come upon him like the  eruption of a jack-in-the-box.<br><br>    ""A defacin' me walls,"" cried Patsy, at the same time emitting a  string of vivid and vile, rather than virile, epithets of  opprobrium.<br><br>    ""If I have given any offense I did not mean to--""<br><br>    But that was as far as the visitor got. Patsy interrupted.<br><br>    ""Get out wid yeh; yeh talk too much wid yer mouth,"" quoted  Patsy, emphasizing his remarks with flourishes of the knife and  fork.<br><br>    Carter Watson caught a quick vision of that eating-fork  inserted uncomfortably between his ribs, knew that it would be  rash to talk further with his mouth, and promptly turned to go.  The sight of his meekly retreating back must have further  enraged Patsy Horan, for that worthy, dropping the table  implements, sprang upon him.<br><br>    Patsy weighed one hundred and eighty pounds. So did Watson. In  this they were equal. But Patsy was a rushing, rough-and-tumble  saloon-fighter, while Watson was a boxer. In this the latter  had the advantage, for Patsy came in wide open, swinging his  right in a perilous sweep. All Watson had to do was to  straight-left him and escape. But Watson had another advantage.  His boxing, and his experience in the slums and ghettos of the  world, had taught him restraint.<br><br>    He pivoted on his feet, and, instead of striking, ducked the  other's swinging blow and went into a clinch. But Patsy,  charging like a bull, had the momentum of his rush, while  Watson, whirling to meet him, had no momentum. As a result, the  pair of them went down, with all their three hundred and sixty  pounds of weight, in a long crashing fall, Watson underneath.  He lay with his head touching the rear wall of the large room.  The street was a hundred and fifty feet away, and he did some  quick thinking. His first thought was to avoid trouble. He had  no wish to get into the papers of this, his childhood town,  where many of his relatives and family friends still lived.<br><br>    So it was that he locked his arms around the man on top of him,  held him close, and waited for the help to come that must come  in response to the crash of the fall. The help came--that is,  six men ran in from the bar and formed about in a semi-circle.<br><br>    'Take him off, fellows,"" Watson said. ""I haven't struck him,  and I don't want any fight.""<br><br>    But the semi-circle remained silent. Watson held on and waited.  Patsy, after various vain efforts to inflict damage, made an  overture.<br><br>    ""Leggo o' me an' I'll get off o' yeh,"" said he.<br><br>    Watson let go, but when Patsy scrambled to his feet he stood  over his recumbent foe, ready to strike.<br><br>    ""Get up,"" Patsy commanded.<br><br>    His voice was stern and implacable, like the voice of God  calling to judgment, and Watson knew there was no mercy there.<br><br>    ""Stand back and I'll get up,"" he countered.<br><br>    ""If yer a gentleman, get up,"" quoth Patsy, his pale blue eyes  aflame with wrath, his fist ready for a crushing blow.<br><br>    At the same moment he drew his foot back to kick the other in  the face. Watson blocked the kick with his crossed arms and  sprang to his feet so quickly that he was in a clinch with his  antagonist before the latter could strike. Holding him, Watson  spoke to the onlookers:<br><br>    ""Take him away from me, fellows. You see I am not striking him.  I don't want to fight. I want to get out of here.""<br><br>    The circle did not move nor speak. Its silence was ominous and  sent a chill to Watson's heart.<br><br>    Patsy made an effort to throw him, which culminated in his  putting Patsy on his back. Tearing loose from him, Watson  sprang to his feet and made for the door. But the circle of men  was interposed a wall. He noticed the white, pasty faces, the  kind that never see the sun, and knew that the men who barred  his way were the nightprowlers and preying beasts of the city  jungle. By them he was thrust back upon the pursuing,  bull-rushing Patsy.<br><br>    Again it was a clinch, in which, in momentary safety, Watson  appealed to the gang. And again his words fell on deaf ears.  Then it was that he knew of many similar knew fear. For he had  known of many similar situations, in low dens like this, when  solitary men were man-handled, their ribs and features caved  in, themselves beaten and kicked to death. And he knew,  further, that if he were to escape he must neither strike his  assailant nor any of the men who opposed him.<br><br>    Yet in him was righteous indignation. Under no circumstances  could seven to one be fair. Also, he was angry, and there  stirred in him the fighting beast that is in all men. But he  remembered his wife and children, his unfinished book, the ten  thousand rolling acres of the up-country ranch he loved so  well. He even saw in flashing visions the blue of the sky, the  golden sun pouring down on his flower-spangled meadows, the  lazy cattle knee-deep in the brooks, and the flash of trout in  the riffles. Life was good-too good for him to risk it for a  moment's sway of the beast. In short, Carter Watson was cool  and scared.<br><br>    His opponent, locked by his masterly clinch, was striving to  throw him. Again Watson put him on the floor, broke away, and  was thrust back by the pasty-faced circle to duck Patsy's  swinging right and effect another clinch. This happened many  times. And Watson grew even cooler, while the baffled Patsy,  unable to inflict punishment, raged wildly and more wildly. He  took to batting with his head in the clinches. The first time,  he landed his forehead flush on Watson's nose. After that, the  latter, in the clinches, buried his face in Patsy's breast. But  the enraged Patsy batted on, striking his own eye and nose and  cheek on the top of the other's head. The more he was thus  injured, the more and the harder did Patsy bat.<br><br>    This one-sided contest continued for twelve or fifteen minutes.  Watson never struck a blow, and strove only to escape.  Sometimes, in the free moments, circling about among the tables  as he tried to win the door, the pasty-faced men gripped his  coat-tails and flung him back at the swinging right of the  on-rushing Patsy. Time upon time, and times without end, he  clinched and put Patsy on his back, each time first whirling  him around and putting him down in the direction of the door  and gaining toward that goal by the length of the fall.<br><br>    In the end, hatless, disheveled, with streaming nose and one  eye closed, Watson won to the sidewalk and into the arms of a  policeman.<br><br>    ""Arrest that man,"" Watson panted.<br><br>    ""Hello, Patsy,"" said the policeman. ""What's the mix-up?""<br><br>    ""Hello, Charley,"" was the answer. ""This guy comes in--"" <br><br>    ""Arrest that man, officer,"" Watson repeated.<br><br>    ""G'wan! Beat it!"" said Patsy.<br><br>    ""Beat it!"" added the policeman. ""If you don't, I'll pull you  in.""<br><br>    ""Not unless you arrest that man. He has committed a violent and  unprovoked assault on me.""<br><br>    ""Is it so, Patsy?"" was the officer's query.<br><br>    ""Nah. Lemme tell you, Charley, an' I got the witnesses to prove  it, so help me God. I was settin' in me kitchen eatin' a bowl  of soup, when this guy comes in an' gets gay wid me. I never  seen him in me born days before. He was drunk--""<br><br>    ""Look at me, officer,"" protested the indignant sociologist. ""Am  I drunk?""<br><br>    The officer looked at him with sullen, menacing eyes and nodded  to Patsy to continue.<br><br>    ""This guy gets gay wid me. 'I'm Tim McGrath,' says he, 'an' I  can do the like to you,' says he. 'Put up yer hands.' I smiles,  an' wid that, biff biff, he lands me twice an' spills me soup.  Look at me eye. I'm fair murdered.""<br><br>    ""What are you going to do, officer?"" Watson demanded.<br><br>    ""Go on, beat it,"" was the answer, ""or I'll pull you sure.""<br><br>    The civic righteousness of Carter Watson flamed up.<br><br>    ""Mr. Officer, I protest--""<br><br>    But at that moment the policeman grabbed his arm with a savage  jerk that nearly overthrew him.<br><br>    ""Come on, you're pulled.""<br><br>    ""Arrest him, too,"" Watson demanded.<br><br>    ""Nix on that play,"" was the reply.<br><br>    ""What did you assault him for, him a peacefully eatin' his  soup?""<br><br>    <b>II</b><br><br>    Carter Watson was genuinely angry. Not only had he been  wantonly assaulted, badly battered, and arrested, but the  morning papers without exception came out with lurid accounts  of his drunken brawl with the proprietor of the notorious  Vendome. Not one accurate or truthful line was published. Patsy  Horan and his satellites described the battle in detail. The  one incontestable thing was that Carter Watson had been drunk.  Thrice he had been thrown out of the place and into the gutter,  and thrice he had come back, breathing blood and fire and  announcing that he was going to clean out the place. ""EMINENT  SOCIOLOGIST JAGGED AND JUGGED,"" was the first head-line he  read, on the front page, accompanied by a large portrait of  himself. Other headlines were: ""CARTER WATSON ASPIRED TO  CHAMPIONSHIP HONORS""; ""CARTER WATSON GETS HIS""; ""NOTED  SOCIOLOGIST ATTEMPTS TO CLEAN OUT A TENDERLOIN CAFE""; and  ""CARTER WATSON KNOCKED OUT BY PATSY HORAN IN THREE ROUNDS.""<br><br>    At the police court, next morning, under bail, appeared Carter  Watson to answer the complaint of the People Versus Carter  Watson, for the latter's assault and battery on one Patsy  Horan. But first, the Prosecuting Attorney, who was paid to  prosecute all offenders against the People, drew him aside and  talked with him privately.<br><br>    ""Why not let it drop!"" said the Prosecuting Attorney. ""I tell  you what you do, Mr. Watson: Shake hands with Mr. Horan and  make it up, and we'll drop the case right here. A word to the  Judge, and the case against you will be dismissed.""<br><br>    ""But I don't want it dismissed,"" was the answer. ""Your office  being what it is, you should be prosecuting me instead of  asking me to make up with this--this fellow.""<br><br>    ""Oh, I'll prosecute you all right,"" retorted the Prosecuting  Attorney.<br><br>    ""Also you will have to prosecute this Patsy Horan,"" Watson  advised; ""for I shall now have him arrested for assault and  battery.""<br><br>    ""You'd better shake and make up,"" the Prosecuting Attorney  repeated, and this time there was almost a threat in his voice.<br><br>    The trials of both men were set for a week later, on the same  morning, in Police Judge Witberg's court.<br><br>    ""You have no chance,"" Watson was told by an old friend of his  boyhood, the retired manager of the biggest paper in the city.  ""Everybody knows you were beaten up by this man. His reputation  is most unsavory. But it won't help you in the least. Both  cases will be dismissed. This will be because you are you. Any  ordinary man would be convicted.""<br><br>    ""But I do not understand,"" objected the perplexed sociologist.  ""Without warning I was attacked by this man; and badly beaten.  I did not strike a blow. I--""<br><br>    ""That has nothing to do with it,"" the other cut him off.<br><br>    ""Then what is there that has anything to do with it?""<br><br>    ""I'll tell you. You are now up against the local police and  political machine. Who are you? You are not even a legal  resident in this town. You live up in the country. You haven't  a vote of your own here. Much less do you swing any votes. This  dive proprietor swings a string of votes in his precincts--a  mighty long string.""<br><br>    ""Do you mean to tell me that this Judge Witberg will violate  the sacredness of his office and oath by letting this brute  off?"" Watson demanded.<br><br>    ""Watch him,"" was the grim reply. ""Oh, he'll do it nicely  enough. He will give an extra-legal, extra-judicial decision,  abounding in every word in the dictionary that stands for  fairness and right.""<br><br>    ""But there are the newspapers,"" Watson cried.<br><br>    ""They are not fighting the administration at present. They'll  give it to you hard. You see what they have already done to  you.""<br><br>    ""Then these snips of boys on the police detail won't write the  truth?""<br><br>    ""They will write something so near like the truth that the  public will believe it. They write their stories under  instruction, you know. They have their orders to twist and  color, and there won't be much left of you when they get done.  Better drop the whole thing right now. You are in bad.""<br><br>    ""But the trials are set.""<br><br>    ""Give the word and they'll drop them now. A man can't fight a  machine unless he has a machine behind him.""<br><br>    <b>III</b><br><br>    But Carter Watson was stubborn. He was convinced that the  machine would beat him, but all his days he had sought social  experience, and this was certainly something new.<br><br>    The morning of the trial the Prosecuting Attorney made another  attempt to patch up the affair.<br><br>    ""If you feel that way, I should like to get a lawyer to  prosecute the case,"" said Watson.<br><br>    ""No, you don't,"" said the Prosecuting Attorney. ""I am paid by  the People to prosecute, and prosecute I will. But let me tell  you. You have no chance. We shall lump both cases into one, and  you watch out.""<br><br>    Judge Witberg looked good to Watson. A fairly young man, short,  comfortably stout, smooth-shaven and with an intelligent face,  he seemed a very nice man indeed. This good impression was  added to by the smiling lips and the wrinkles of laughter in  the corners of his black eyes. Looking at him and studying him,  Watson felt almost sure that his old friend's prognostication  was wrong.<br><br>    But Watson was soon to learn. Patsy Horan and two of his  satellites testified to a most colossal aggregation of  perjuries. Watson could not have believed it possible without  having experienced it. They denied the existence of the other  four men. And of the two that testified, one claimed to have  been in the kitchen, a witness to Watson's unprovoked assault  on Patsy, while the other, remaining in the bar, had witnessed  Watson's second and third rushes into the place as he attempted  to annihilate the unoffending Patsy. The vile language ascribed  to Watson was so voluminously and unspeakably vile, that he  felt they were injuring their own case. It was so impossible  that he should utter such things. But when they described the  brutal blows he had rained on poor Patsy's face, and the chair  he demolished when he vainly attempted to kick Patsy, Watson  waxed secretly hilarious and at the same time sad. The trial  was a farce, but such lowness of life was depressing to  contemplate when he considered the long upward climb humanity  must make.<br><br>    Watson could not recognize himself, nor could his worst enemy  have recognized him, in the swashbuckling, rough-housing  picture that was painted of him. But, as in all cases of  complicated perjury, rifts and contradictions in the various  stories appeared. The Judge somehow failed to notice them,  while the Prosecuting Attorney and Patsy's attorney shied off  from them gracefully. Watson had not bothered to get a lawyer  for himself, and he was now glad that he had not.<br><br>    Still, he retained a semblance of faith in Judge Witberg when  he went himself on the stand and started to tell his story.<br><br>    ""I was strolling casually along the street, your Honor,"" Watson  began, but was interrupted by the Judge.<br><br>    ""We are not here to consider your previous actions,"" bellowed  Judge Witberg. ""Who struck the first blow?""<br><br>    ""Your Honor,"" Watson pleaded, ""I have no witnesses of the  actual fray, and the truth of my story can only be brought out  by telling the story fully--""<br><br>    Again he was interrupted.<br><br>    ""We do not care to publish any magazines here,"" Judge Witberg  roared, looking at him so fiercely and malevolently that Watson  could scarcely bring himself to believe that this was same man  he had studied a few minutes previously.<br><br>    ""Who struck the first blow?"" Patsy's attorney asked.<br><br>    The Prosecuting Attorney interposed, demanding to know which of  the two cases lumped together was, and by what right Patsy's  lawyer, at that stage of the proceedings, should take the  witness. Patsy's attorney fought back. Judge Witberg  interfered, professing no knowledge of any two cases being  lumped together. All this had to be explained. Battle royal  raged, terminating in both attorneys apologizing to the Court  and to each other. And so it went, and to Watson it had the  seeming of a group of pickpockets ruffling and bustling an  honest man as they took his purse. The machine was working,  that was all.<br><br>    ""Why did you enter this place of unsavory reputations?"" was  asked him.<br><br>    ""It has been my custom for many years, as a student of  economics and sociology, to acquaint myself--""<br><br>    But this was as far as Watson got.<br><br>    ""We want none of your ologies here,"" snarled Judge Witberg. ""It  is a plain question. Answer it plainly. Is it true or not true  that you were drunk? That is the gist of the question.""<br><br>    When Watson attempted to tell how Patsy had injured his face in  his attempts to bat with his head, Watson was openly scouted  and flouted, and Judge Witberg again took him in hand.<br><br>    ""Are you aware of the solemnity of the oath you took to testify  to nothing but the truth on this witness stand?"" the Judge  demanded. ""This is a fairy story you are telling. It is not  reasonable that a man would so injure himself, and continue to  injure himself, by striking the soft and sensitive parts of his  face against your head. You are a sensible man. It is  unreasonable, is it not?""<br><br>    ""Men are unreasonable when they are angry,"" Watson answered  meekly.<br><br>    Then it was that Judge Witberg was deeply outraged and  righteously wrathful.<br><br>    ""What right have you to say that?"" he cried. ""It is gratuitous.  It has no bearing on the case. You are here as a witness, sir,  of events that have transpired. The Court does not wish to hear  any expressions of opinion from you at all.""<br><br>    ""I but answered your question, your Honor,"" Watson protested  humbly.<br><br>    ""You did nothing of the sort,"" was the next blast. ""And let me  warn you, sir, let me warn you, that you are laying yourself  liable to contempt by such insolence. And I will have you know  that we know how to observe the law and the rules of courtesy  down here in this little courtroom. I am ashamed of you.""<br><br>    And, while the next punctilious legal wrangle between the  attorneys interrupted his tale of what happened in the Vendome,  Carter Watson, without bitterness, amused and at the same time  sad, saw rise before him the machine, large and small, that  dominated his country, the unpunished and shameless grafts of a  thousand cities perpetrated by the spidery and vermin-like  creatures of the machines. Here it was before him, a courtroom  and a judge, bowed down in subservience by the machine to a  dive-keeper who swung a string of votes. Petty and sordid as it  was, it was one face of the many-faced machine that loomed  colossally, in every city and state, in a thousand guises  overshadowing the land.<br><br>    A familiar phrase rang in his ears: ""It is to laugh."" At the  height of the wrangle, he giggled, once, aloud, and earned a  sullen frown from Judge Witberg. Worse, a myriad times, he  decided, were these bullying lawyers and this bullying judge  then the bucko mates in first quality hell-ships, who not only  did their own bullying but protected themselves as well. These  petty rapscallions, on the other hand, sought protection behind  the majesty of the law. They struck, but no one was permitted  to strike back, for behind them were the prison cells and the  clubs of the stupid policemen--paid and professional fighters  and beaters-up of men. Yet he was not bitter. The grossness and  the sliminess of it was forgotten in the simple grotesqueness  of it, and he had the saving sense of humor.<br><br>    Nevertheless, hectored and heckled though he was, he managed in  the end to give a simple, straightforward version of the  affair, and, despite a belligerent cross-examination, his story  was not shaken in any particular. Quite different it was from  the perjuries that had shouted aloud from the perjuries of  Patsy and his two witnesses.<br><br>    Both Patsy's attorney and the Prosecuting Attorney rested their  cases, letting everything go before the Court without argument.  Watson protested against this, but was silenced when the  Prosecuting Attorney told him that Public Prosecutor and knew  his business.<br><br>    ""Patrick Horan has testified that he was in danger of his life  and that he was compelled to defend himself,"" Judge Witberg's  verdict began. ""Mr. Watson has testified to the same thing.  Each has sworn that the other struck the first blow; each has  sworn that the other made an unprovoked assault on him. It is  an axiom of the law that the defendant should be given the  benefit of the doubt. A very reasonable doubt exists.  Therefore, in the case of the People Versus Carter Watson the  benefit of the doubt is given to said Carter Watson and he is  herewith ordered discharged from custody. The same reasoning  applies to the case of the People Versus Patrick Horan. He is  given the benefit of the doubt and discharged from custody. My  recommendation is that both defendants shake hands and make  up.""<br><br>    In the afternoon papers the first headline that caught Watson's  eye was: ""CARTER WATSON ACQUITTED."" In the second paper it was:  ""CARTER WATSON ESCAPES A FINE."" But what capped everything was  the one beginning: ""CARTER WATSON A GOOD FELLOW."" In the text  he read how Judge Witberg had advised both fighters to shake  hands, which they promptly did. Further, he read: <br><br>    ""'Let's have a nip on it,' said Patsy Horan.<br><br>    ""'Sure,' said Carter Watson.<br><br>    ""And, arm in arm, they ambled for the nearest saloon.""<br><br>    <b>IV</b><br><br>    Now, from the whole adventure, Watson carried away no  bitterness. It was a social experience of a new order, and it  led to the writing of another book, which he entitled, ""POLICE  COURT PROCEDURE: A Tentative Analysis.""<br><br>    One summer morning a year later, on his ranch, he left his  horse and himself clambered on through a miniature canyon to  inspect some rock ferns he had planted the previous winter.  Emerging from the upper end of the canyon, he came out on one  of his flower-spangled meadows, a delightful isolated spot,  screened from the world by low hills and clumps of trees. And  here he found a man, evidently on a stroll from the summer  hotel down at the little town a mile away. They met face to  face and the recognition was mutual. It was Judge Witberg.  Also, it was a clear case of trespass, for Watson had trespass  signs upon his boundaries, though he never enforced them.<br><br>    Judge Witberg held out his hand, which Watson refused to see.<br><br>    ""Politics is a dirty trade, isn't it, Judge?"" he remarked. ""Oh,  yes, I see your hand, but I don't care to take it. The papers  said I shook hands with Patsy Horan after the trial. You know I  did not, but let me tell you that I'd a thousand times rather  shake hands with him and his vile following of curs, than with  you.""<br><br>    Judge Witberg was painfully flustered, and as he hemmed and  hawed and essayed to speak, Watson, looking at him, was struck  by a sudden whim, and he determined on a grim and facetious  antic.<br><br>    ""I should scarcely expect any animus from a man of your  acquirements and knowledge of the world,"" the Judge was saying.<br><br>    ""Animus?"" Watson replied. ""Certainly not. I haven't such a  thing in my nature. And to prove it, let me show you something  curious, something you have never seen before."" Casting about  him, Watson picked up a rough stone the size of his fist. ""See  this. Watch me.""<br><br>    So saying, Carter Watson tapped himself a sharp blow on the  cheek. The stone laid the flesh open to the bone and the blood  spurted forth.<br><br>    ""The stone was too sharp,"" he announced to the astounded police  judge, who thought he had gone mad.<br><br>    ""I must bruise it a trifle. There is nothing like being  realistic in such matters.""<br><br>    Whereupon Carter Watson found a smooth stone and with it  pounded his cheek nicely several times.<br><br>    ""Ah,"" he cooed. ""That will turn beautifully green and black in  a few hours. It will be most convincing.""<br><br>    ""You are insane,"" Judge Witberg quavered.<br><br>    ""Don't use such vile language to me,"" said Watson. ""You see my  bruised and bleeding face? You did that, with that right hand  of yours. You hit me twice--biff, biff. It is a brutal and  unprovoked assault. I am in danger of my life. I must protect  myself.""<br><br>    Judge Witberg backed away in alarm before the menacing fists of  the other.<br><br>    ""If you strike me I'll have you arrested,"" Judge Witberg  threatened.<br><br>    ""That is what I told Patsy,"" was the answer. ""And do you know  what he did when I told him that?""<br><br>    ""No.""<br><br>    ""That!""<br><br>    And at the same moment Watson's right fist landed flush on  Judge Witberg's nose, putting that legal gentleman over on his  back on the grass.<br><br>    ""Get up!"" commanded Watson. ""If you are a gentleman, get  up--that's what Patsy told me, you know.""<br><br>    Judge Witberg declined to rise, and was dragged to his feet by  the coat-collar, only to have one eye blacked and be put on his  back again. After that it was a red Indian massacre. Judge  Witberg was humanely and scientifically beaten up. His checks  were boxed, his cars cuffed, and his face was rubbed in the  turf. And all the time Watson exposited the way Patsy Horan had  done it. Occasionally, and very carefully, the facetious  sociologist administered a real bruising blow. Once, dragging  the poor Judge to his feet, he deliberately bumped his own nose  on the gentleman's head. The nose promptly bled.<br><br>    ""See that!"" cried Watson, stepping back and deftly shedding his  blood all down his own shirt front. ""You did it. With your fist  you did it. It is awful. I am fair murdered. I must again  defend myself.""<br><br>    And once more Judge Witberg impacted his features on a fist and  was sent to grass.<br><br>    ""I will have you arrested,"" he sobbed as he lay.<br><br>    ""That's what Patsy said.""<br><br>    ""A brutal---sniff, sniff,--and unprovoked--sniff, sniff--  assault.""<br><br>    ""That's what Patsy said.""<br><br>    ""I will surely have you arrested.""<br><br>    ""Speaking slangily, not if I can beat you to it.""<br><br>    And with that, Carter Watson departed down the canyon, mounted  his horse, and rode to town.<br><br>    An hour later, as Judge Witberg limped up the grounds to his  hotel, he was arrested by a village constable on a charge of  assault and battery preferred by Carter Watson.<br><br>    <b>V</b><br><br>    ""Your Honor,"" Watson said next day to the village Justice, a  well to do farmer and graduate, thirty years before, from a cow  college, ""since this Sol Witberg has seen fit to charge me with  battery, following upon my charge of battery against him, I  would suggest that both cases be lumped together. The testimony  and the facts are the same in both cases.""<br><br>    To this the Justice agreed, and the double case proceeded.  Watson, as prosecuting witness, first took the stand and told  his story.<br><br>    ""I was picking flowers,"" he testified. ""Picking flowers on my  own land, never dreaming of danger. Suddenly this man rushed  upon me from behind the trees. 'I am the Dodo,' he says, 'and I  can do you to a frazzle. Put up your hands.' I smiled, but with  that, biff, biff, he struck me, knocking me down and spilling  my flowers. The language he used was frightful. It was an  unprovoked and brutal assault. Look at my cheek. Look at my  nose--I could not understand it. He must have been drunk.  Before I recovered from my surprise he had administered this  beating. I was in danger of my life and was compelled to defend  himself. That is all, Your Honor, though I must say, in  conclusion, that I cannot get over my perplexity. Why did he  say he was the Dodo? Why did he so wantonly attack me?""<br><br>    And thus was Sol Witberg given a liberal education in the art  of perjury. Often, from his high seat, he had listened  indulgently to police court perjuries in cooked-up cases; but  for the first time perjury was directed against him, and he no  longer sat above the court, with the bailiffs, the Policemen's  clubs, and the prison cells behind him.<br><br>    ""Your Honor,"" he cried, ""never have I heard such a pack of lies  told by so bare-faced a liar--!'<br><br>    Watson here sprang to his feet.<br><br>    ""Your Honor, I protest. It is for your Honor to decide truth or  falsehood. The witness is on the stand to testify to actual  events that have transpired. His personal opinion upon things  in general, and upon me, has no bearing on the case whatever.""<br><br>    The Justice scratched his head and waxed phlegmatically  indignant.<br><br>    ""The point is well taken,"" he decided. ""I am surprised at you,  Mr. Witberg, claiming to be a judge and skilled in the practice  of the law, and yet being guilty of such unlawyerlike conduct.  Your manner, sir, and your methods, remind me of a shyster.  This is a simple case of assault and battery. We are here to  determine who struck the first blow, and we are not interested  in your estimates of Mr. Watson's personal character. Proceed  with your story.""<br><br>    Sol Witberg would have bitten his bruised and swollen lip in  chagrin, had it not hurt so much. But he contained himself and  told a simple, straightforward, truthful story.<br><br>    ""Your Honor,"" Watson said, ""I would suggest that you ask him  what he was doing on my premises.""<br><br>    ""A very good question. What were you doing, sir, on Mr.  Watson's premises?""<br><br>    ""I did not know they were his premises.""<br><br>    ""It was a trespass, your Honor,"" Watson cried. ""The warnings  are posted conspicuously.""<br><br>    ""I saw no warnings,"" said Sol Witberg.<br><br>    ""I have seen them myself,"" snapped the Justice. ""They are very  conspicuous. And I would warn you, sir, that if you palter with  the truth in such little matters you may darken your more  important statements with suspicion. Why did you strike Mr.  Watson?""<br><br>    ""Your Honor, as I have testified, I did not strike a blow.""<br><br>    The Justice looked at Carter Watson's bruised and swollen  visage, and turned to glare at Sol Witberg.<br><br>    ""Look at that man's cheek!"" he thundered. ""If you did not  strike a blow how comes it that he is so disfigured and  injured?""<br><br>    ""As I testified--""<br><br>    ""Be careful,"" the Justice warned.<br><br>    ""I will be careful, sir. I will say nothing but the truth. He  struck himself with a rock. He struck himself with two  different rocks.""<br><br>    ""Does it stand to reason that a man, any man not a lunatic,  would so injure himself, and continue to injure himself, by  striking the soft and sensitive parts of his face with a  stone?"" Carter Watson demanded<br><br>    ""It sounds like a fairy story,"" was the Justice's comment.<br><br>    ""Mr. Witberg, had you been drinking?""<br><br>    ""No, sir.""<br><br>    ""Do you never drink?""<br><br>    ""On occasion.""<br><br>    The Justice meditated on this answer with an air of astute  profundity.<br><br>    Watson took advantage of the opportunity to wink at Sol  Witberg, but that much-abused gentleman saw nothing humorous in  the situation.<br><br>    ""A very peculiar case, a very peculiar case,"" the Justice  announced, as he began his verdict. ""The evidence of the two  parties is flatly contradictory. There are no witnesses outside  the two principals. Each claims the other committed the  assault, and I have no legal way of determining the truth. But  I have my private opinion, Mr. Witberg, and I would recommend  that henceforth you keep off of Mr. Watson's premises and keep  away from this section of the country--""<br><br>    ""This is an outrage!"" Sol Witberg blurted out.<br><br>    ""Sit down, sir!"" was the Justice's thundered command. ""If you  interrupt the Court in this manner again, I shall fine you for  contempt. And I warn you I shall fine you heavily--you, a judge  yourself, who should be conversant with the courtesy and  dignity of courts. I shall now give my verdict:<br><br>    ""It is a rule of law that the defendant shall be given the  benefit of the doubt. As I have said, and I repeat, there is no  legal way for me to determine who struck the first blow.  Therefore, and much to my regret,""--here he paused and glared  at Sol Witberg--""in each of these cases I am compelled to give  the defendant the benefit of the doubt. Gentlemen, you are both  dismissed.""<br><br>    ""Let us have a nip on it,"" Watson said to Witberg, as they left  the courtroom; but that outraged person refused to lock arms  and amble to the nearest saloon.  						                                      <br><br>"
40,The End of the Story,"I<br><br>The table was of hand-hewn spruce boards, and the men who played whist had frequent difficulties in drawing home their tricks across the uneven surface. Though they sat in their undershirts, the sweat noduled and oozed on their faces; yet their feet, heavily moccasined and woollen-socked, tingled with the bite of the frost. Such was the difference of temperature in the small cabin between the floor level and a yard or more above it. The sheet-iron Yukon Stove roared red-hot, yet, eight feet away, on the meat-shelf, placed low and beside the door, lay chunks of solidly frozen moose and bacon. The door, a third of the way up from the bottom, was a thick rime. In the chinking between the logs at the back of the bunks the frost showed white and glistening. A window of oiled paper furnished light. The lower portion of the paper, on the inside, was coated an inch deep with the frozen moisture of the men's breath.<br><br>They played a momentous rubber of whist, for the pair that lost was to dig a fishing hole through the seven feet of ice and snow that covered the Yukon.<br><br>""It's mighty unusual, a cold snap like this in March,"" remarked the man who shuffled. ""What would you call it, Bob?""<br><br>""Oh, fifty-five or sixty below--all of that. What do you make it, Doc?""<br><br>Doc turned his head and glanced at the lower part of the door with a measuring eye.<br><br>""Not a bit worse than fifty. If anything, slightly under--say forty-nine. See the ice on the door. It's just about the fifty mark, but you'll notice the upper edge is ragged. The time she went seventy the ice climbed a full four inches higher."" He picked up his hand, and without ceasing from sorting called ""Come in,"" to a knock on the door.<br><br>The man who entered was a big, broad-shouldered Swede, though his nationality was not discernible until he had removed his ear-flapped cap and thawed away the ice which had formed on beard and moustache and which served to mask his face. While engaged in this, the men at the table played out the hand.<br><br>""I hear one doctor faller stop this camp,"" the Swede said inquiringly, looking anxiously from face to face, his own face haggard and drawn from severe and long endured pain. ""I come long way. North fork of the Whyo.""<br><br>""I'm the doctor. What's the matter?""<br><br>In response, the man held up his left hand, the second finger of which was monstrously swollen. At the same time he began a rambling, disjointed history of the coming and growth of his affliction.<br><br>""Let me look at it,"" the doctor broke in impatiently. ""Lay it on the table. There, like that.""<br><br>Tenderly, as if it were a great boil, the man obeyed.<br><br>""Humph,"" the doctor grumbled. ""A weeping sinew. And travelled a hundred miles to have it fixed. I'll fix it in a jiffy. You watch me, and next time you can do it yourself.""<br><br>Without warning, squarely and at right angles, and savagely, the doctor brought the edge of his hand down on the swollen crooked finger. The man yelled with consternation and agony. It was more like the cry of a wild beast, and his face was a wild beast's as he was about to spring on the man who had perpetrated the joke.<br><br>""That's all right,"" the doctor placated sharply and authoritatively. ""How do you feel? Better, eh? Of course. Next time you can do it yourself--Go on and deal, Strothers. I think we've got you.""<br><br>Slow and ox-like, on the face of the Swede dawned relief and comprehension. The pang over, the finger felt better. The pain was gone. He examined the finger curiously, with wondering eyes, slowly crooking it back and forth. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a gold-sack.<br><br>""How much?""<br><br>The doctor shook his head impatiently. ""Nothing. I'm not practising--Your play, Bob.""<br><br>The Swede moved heavily on his feet, re-examined the finger, then turned an admiring gaze on the doctor.<br><br>""You are good man. What your name?""<br><br>""Linday, Doctor Linday,"" Strothers answered, as if solicitous to save his opponent from further irritation.<br><br>""The day's half done,"" Linday said to the Swede, at the end of the hand, while he shuffled. ""Better rest over to-night. It's too cold for travelling. There's a spare bunk.""<br><br>He was a slender brunette of a man, lean-cheeked, thin-lipped, and strong. The smooth-shaven face was a healthy sallow. All his movements were quick and precise. He did not fumble his cards. The eyes were black, direct, and piercing, with the trick of seeming to look beneath the surfaces of things. His hands, slender, fine and nervous, appeared made for delicate work, and to the most casual eye they conveyed an impression of strength.<br><br>""Our game,"" he announced, drawing in the last trick. ""Now for the rub and who digs the fishing hole.""<br><br>A knock at the door brought a quick exclamation from him.<br><br>""Seems we just can't finish this rubber,"" he complained, as the door opened. ""What's the matter with <i>you</i>?""--this last to the stranger who entered.<br><br>The newcomer vainly strove to move his icebound jaws and jowls. That he had been on trail for long hours and days was patent. The skin across the cheekbones was black with repeated frost-bite. From nose to chin was a mass of solid ice perforated by the hole through which he breathed. Through this he had also spat tobacco juice, which had frozen, as it trickled, into an amber-coloured icicle, pointed like a Van Dyke beard.<br><br>He shook his head dumbly, grinned with his eyes, and drew near to the stove to thaw his mouth to speech. He assisted the process with his fingers, clawing off fragments of melting ice which rattled and sizzled on the stove.<br><br>""Nothing the matter with me,"" he finally announced. ""But if they's a doctor in the outfit he's sure needed. They's a man up the Little Peco that's had a ruction with a panther, an' the way he's clawed is something scand'lous.""<br><br>""How far up?"" Doctor Linday demanded.<br><br>""A matter of a hundred miles.""<br><br>""How long since?""<br><br>""I've ben three days comin' down.""<br><br>""Bad?""<br><br>""Shoulder dislocated. Some ribs broke for sure. Right arm broke. An' clawed clean to the bone most all over but the face. We sewed up two or three bad places temporary, and tied arteries with twine.""<br><br>""That settles it,"" Linday sneered. ""Where were they?""<br><br>""Stomach.""<br><br>""He's a sight by now.""<br><br>""Not on your life. Washed clean with bug-killin' dope before we stitched. Only temporary anyway. Had nothin' but linen thread, but washed that, too.""<br><br>""He's as good as dead,"" was Linday's judgment, as he angrily fingered the cards.<br><br>""Nope. That man ain't goin' to die. He knows I've come for a doctor, an' he'll make out to live until you get there. He won't let himself die. I know him.""<br><br>""Christian Science and gangrene, eh?"" came the sneer. ""Well, I'm not practising. Nor can I see myself travelling a hundred miles at fifty below for a dead man.""<br><br>""I can see you, an' for a man a long ways from dead.""<br><br>Linday shook his head. ""Sorry you had your trip for nothing. Better stop over for the night.""<br><br>""Nope. We'll be pullin' out in ten minutes.""<br><br>""What makes you so cocksure?"" Linday demanded testily.<br><br>Then it was that Tom Daw made the speech of his life.<br><br>""Because he's just goin' on livin' till you get there, if it takes you a week to make up your mind. Besides, his wife's with him, not sheddin' a tear, or nothin', an' she's helpin' him live till you come. They think a almighty heap of each other, an' she's got a will like hisn. If he weakened, she'd just put her immortal soul into hisn an' make him live. Though he ain't weakenin' none, you can stack on that. I'll stack on it. I'll lay you three to one, in ounces, he's alive when you get there. I got a team of dawgs down the bank. You ought to allow to start in ten minutes, an' we ought to make it back in less'n three days because the trail's broke. I'm goin' down to the dawgs now, an' I'll look for you in ten minutes.""<br><br>Tom Daw pulled down his earflaps, drew on his mittens, and passed out.<br><br>""Damn him!"" Linday cried, glaring vindictively at the closed door.<br><br>That night, long after dark, with twenty-five miles behind them, Linday and Tom Daw went into camp. It was a simple but adequate affair: a fire built in the snow; alongside, their sleeping-furs spread in a single bed on a mat of spruce boughs; behind the bed an oblong of canvas stretched to refract the heat. Daw fed the dogs and chopped ice and firewood. Linday's cheeks burned with frost-bite as he squatted over the cooking. They ate heavily, smoked a pipe and talked while they dried their moccasins before the fire, and turned in to sleep the dead sleep of fatigue and health.<br><br>Morning found the unprecedented cold snap broken. Linday estimated the temperature at fifteen below and rising. Daw was worried. That day would see them in the canyon, he explained, and if the spring thaw set in the canyon would run open water. The walls of the canyon were hundreds to thousands of feet high. They could be climbed, but the going would be slow.<br><br>Camped well in the dark and forbidding gorge, over their pipe that evening they complained of the heat, and both agreed that the thermometer must be above zero--the first time in six months.<br><br>""Nobody ever heard tell of a panther this far north,"" Daw was saying. ""Rocky called it a cougar. But I shot a-many of 'em down in Curry County, Oregon, where I come from, an' we called 'em panther. Anyway, it was a bigger cat than ever I seen. It was sure a monster cat. Now how'd it ever stray to such out of the way huntin' range?--that's the question.""<br><br>Linday made no comment. He was nodding. Propped on sticks, his moccasins steamed unheeded and unturned. The dogs, curled in furry balls, slept in the snow. The crackle of an ember accentuated the profound of silence that reigned. He awoke with a start and gazed at Daw, who nodded and returned the gaze. Both listened. From far off came a vague disturbance that increased to a vast and sombre roaring. As it neared, ever-increasing, riding the mountain tops as well as the canyon depths, bowing the forest before it, bending the meagre, crevice-rooted pines on the walls of the gorge, they knew it for what it was. A wind, strong and warm, a balmy gale, drove past them, flinging a rocket-shower of sparks from the fire. The dogs, aroused, sat on their haunches, bleak noses pointed upward, and raised the long wolf howl.<br><br>""It's the Chinook,"" Daw said.<br><br>""It means the river trail, I suppose?""<br><br>""Sure thing. And ten miles of it is easier than one over the tops."" Daw surveyed Linday for a long, considering minute. ""We've just had fifteen hours of trail,"" he shouted above the wind, tentatively, and again waited. ""Doc,"" he said finally, ""are you game?""<br><br>For answer, Linday knocked out his pipe and began to pull on his damp moccasins. Between them, and in few minutes, bending to the force of the wind, the dogs were harnessed, camp broken, and the cooking outfit and unused sleeping furs lashed on the sled. Then, through the darkness, for a night of travel, they churned out on the trail Daw had broken nearly a week before. And all through the night the Chinook roared and they urged the weary dogs and spurred their own jaded muscles. Twelve hours of it they made, and stopped for breakfast after twenty-seven hours on trail.<br><br>""An hour's sleep,"" said Daw, when they had wolfed pounds of straight moose-meat fried with bacon.<br><br>Two hours he let his companion sleep, afraid himself to close his eyes. He occupied himself with making marks upon the soft-surfaced, shrinking snow. Visibly it shrank. In two hours the snow level sank three inches. From every side, faintly heard and near, under the voice of the spring wind, came the trickling of hidden waters. The Little Peco, strengthened by the multitudinous streamlets, rose against the manacles of winter, riving the ice with crashings and snappings.<br><br>Daw touched Linday on the shoulder; touched him again; shook, and shook violently.<br><br>""Doc,"" he murmured admiringly. ""You can sure go some.""<br><br>The weary black eyes, under heavy lids, acknowledged the compliment.<br><br>""But that ain't the question. Rocky is clawed something scand'lous. As I said before, I helped sew up his in'ards. Doc...."" He shook the man, whose eyes had again closed. ""I say, Doc! The question is: can you go some more?--hear me? I say, can you go some more?""<br><br>The weary dogs snapped and whimpered when kicked from their sleep. The going was slow, not more than two miles an hour, and the animals took every opportunity to lie down in the wet snow.<br><br>""Twenty miles of it, and we'll be through the gorge,"" Daw encouraged. ""After that the ice can go to blazes, for we can take to the bank, and it's only ten more miles to camp. Why, Doc, we're almost there. And when you get Rocky fixed up, you can come down in a canoe in one day.""<br><br>But the ice grew more uneasy under them, breaking loose from the shore-line and rising steadily inch by inch. In places where it still held to the shore, the water overran and they waded and slushed across. The Little Peco growled and muttered. Cracks and fissures were forming everywhere as they battled on for the miles that each one of which meant ten along the tops.<br><br>""Get on the sled, Doc, an' take a snooze,"" Daw invited.<br><br>The glare from the black eyes prevented him from repeating the suggestion.<br><br>As early as midday they received definite warning of the beginning of the end. Cakes of ice, borne downward in the rapid current, began to thunder beneath the ice on which they stood. The dogs whimpered anxiously and yearned for the bank.<br><br>""That means open water above,"" Daw explained. ""Pretty soon she'll jam somewheres, an' the river'll raise a hundred feet in a hundred minutes. It's us for the tops if we can find a way to climb out. Come on! Hit her up I! An' just to think, the Yukon'll stick solid for weeks.""<br><br>Unusually narrow at this point, the great walls of the canyon were too precipitous to scale. Daw and Linday had to keep on; and they kept on till the disaster happened. With a loud explosion, the ice broke asunder midway under the team. The two animals in the middle of the string went into the fissure, and the grip of the current on their bodies dragged the lead-dog backward and in. Swept downstream under the ice, these three bodies began to drag to the edge the two whining dogs that remained. The men held back frantically on the sled, but were slowly drawn along with it. It was all over in the space of seconds. Daw slashed the wheel-dog's traces with his sheath-knife, and the animal whipped over the ice-edge and was gone. The ice on which they stood, broke into a large and pivoting cake that ground and splintered against the shore ice and rocks. Between them they got the sled ashore and up into a crevice in time to see the ice-cake up-edge, sink, and down-shelve from view.<br><br>Meat and sleeping furs were made into packs, and the sled was abandoned. Linday resented Daw's taking the heavier pack, but Daw had his will.<br><br>""You got to work as soon as you get there. Come on.""<br><br>It was one in the afternoon when they started to climb. At eight that evening they cleared the rim and for half an hour lay where they had fallen. Then came the fire, a pot of coffee, and an enormous feed of moosemeat. But first Linday hefted the two packs, and found his own lighter by half.<br><br>""You're an iron man, Daw,"" he admired.<br><br>""Who? Me? Oh, pshaw! You ought to see Rocky. He's made out of platinum, an' armour plate, an' pure gold, an' all strong things. I'm mountaineer, but he plumb beats me out. Down in Curry County I used to 'most kill the boys when we run bear. So when I hooks up with Rocky on our first hunt I had a mean idea to show 'm a few. I let out the links good an' generous, 'most nigh keepin' up with the dawgs, an' along comes Rocky a-treadin' on my heels. I knowed he couldn't last that way, and I just laid down an' did my dangdest. An' there he was, at the end of another hour, a-treadin' steady an' regular on my heels. I was some huffed. 'Mebbe you'd like to come to the front an' show me how to travel,' I says. 'Sure,' says he. An' he done it! I stayed with 'm, but let me tell you I was plumb tuckered by the time the bear tree'd.<br><br>""They ain't no stoppin' that man. He ain't afraid of nothin'. Last fall, before the freeze-up, him an' me was headin' for camp about twilight. I was clean shot out--ptarmigan--an' he had one cartridge left. An' the dawgs tree'd a she grizzly. Small one. Only weighed about three hundred, but you know what grizzlies is. 'Don't do it,' says I, when he ups with his rifle. 'You only got that one shot, an' it's too dark to see the sights.'<br><br>""'Climb a tree,' says he. I didn't climb no tree, but when that bear come down a-cussin' among the dawgs, an' only creased, I want to tell you I was sure hankerin' for a tree. It was some ruction. Then things come on real bad. The bear slid down a hollow against a big log. Downside, that log was four feet up an' down. Dawgs couldn't get at bear that way. Upside was steep gravel, an' the dawgs'd just naturally slide down into the bear. They was no jumpin' back, an' the bear was a-manglin' 'em fast as they come. All underbrush, gettin' pretty dark, no cartridges, nothin'.<br><br>""What's Rocky up an' do? He goes downside of log, reaches over with his knife, an' begins slashin'. But he can only reach bear's rump, an' dawgs bein' ruined fast, one-two-three time. Rocky gets desperate. He don't like to lose his dawgs. He jumps on top log, grabs bear by the slack of the rump, an' heaves over back'ard right over top of that log. Down they go, kit an' kaboodle, twenty feet, bear, dawgs, an' Rocky, slidin', cussin', an' scratchin', ker-plump into ten feet of water in the bed of stream. They all swum out different ways. Nope, he didn't get the bear, but he saved the dawgs. That's Rocky. They's no stoppin' him when his mind's set.""<br><br>It was at the next camp that Linday heard how Rocky had come to be injured.<br><br>""I'd ben up the draw, about a mile from the cabin, lookin' for a piece of birch likely enough for an axe-handle. Comin' back I heard the darndest goings-on where we had a bear trap set. Some trapper had left the trap in an old cache an' Rocky'd fixed it up. But the goings-on. It was Rocky an' his brother Harry. First I'd hear one yell and laugh, an' then the other, like it was some game. An' what do you think the fool game was? I've saw some pretty nervy cusses down in Curry County, but they beat all. They'd got a whoppin' big panther in the trap an' was takin' turns rappin' it on the nose with a light stick. But that wa'n't the point. I just come out of the brush in time to see Harry rap it. Then he chops six inches off the stick an' passes it to Rocky. You see, that stick was growin' shorter all the time. It ain't as easy as you think. The panther'd slack back an' hunch down an' spit, an' it was mighty lively in duckin' the stick. An' you never knowed when it'd jump. It was caught by the hind leg, which was curious, too, an' it had some slack I'm tellin' you.<br><br>""It was just a game of dare they was playin', an' the stick gettin' shorter an' shorter an' the panther madder 'n madder. Bimeby they wa'n't no stick left--only a nubbin, about four inches long, an' it was Rocky's turn. 'Better quit now,' says Harry. 'What for?' says Rocky. 'Because if you rap him again they won't be no stick left for me,' Harry answers. 'Then you'll quit an' I win,' says Rocky with a laugh, an' goes to it.<br><br>""An' I don't want to see anything like it again. That cat'd bunched back an' down till it had all of six feet slack in its body. An' Rocky's stick four inches long. The cat got him. You couldn't see one from t'other. No chance to shoot. It was Harry, in the end, that got his knife into the panther's jugular.""<br><br>""If I'd known how he got it I'd never have come,"" was Linday's comment.<br><br>Daw nodded concurrence.<br><br>""That's what she said. She told me sure not to whisper how it happened.""<br><br>""Is he crazy?"" Linday demanded in his wrath.<br><br>""They're all crazy. Him an' his brother are all the time devilin' each other to tom-fool things. I seen them swim the riffle last fall, bad water an' mush-ice runnin'--on a dare. They ain't nothin' they won't tackle. An' she's 'most as bad. Not afraid some herself. She'll do anything Rocky'll let her. But he's almighty careful with her. Treats her like a queen. No camp-work or such for her. That's why another man an' me are hired on good wages. They've got slathers of money an' they're sure dippy on each other. 'Looks like good huntin',' says Rocky, when they struck that section last fall. 'Let's make a camp then,' says Harry. An' me all the time thinkin' they was lookin' for gold. Ain't ben a prospect pan washed the whole winter.""<br><br>Linday's anger mounted. ""I haven't any patience with fools. For two cents I'd turn back.""<br><br>""No you wouldn't,"" Daw assured him confidently. ""They ain't enough grub to turn back, an' we'll be there to-morrow. Just got to cross that last divide an' drop down to the cabin. An' they's a better reason. You're too far from home, an' I just naturally wouldn't let you turn back.""<br><br>Exhausted as Linday was, the flash in his black eyes warned Daw that he had overreached himself. His hand went out.<br><br>""My mistake, Doc. Forget it. I reckon I'm gettin' some cranky what of losin' them dawgs.""<br><br>Not one day, but three days later, the two men, after being snowed in on the summit by a spring blizzard, staggered up to a cabin that stood in a fat bottom beside the roaring Little Peco. Coming in from the bright sunshine to the dark cabin, Linday observed little of its occupants. He was no more than aware of two men and a woman. But he was not interested in them. He went directly to the bunk where lay the injured man. The latter was lying on his back, with eyes closed, and Linday noted the slender stencilling of the brows and the kinky silkiness of the brown hair. Thin and wan, the face seemed too small for the muscular neck, yet the delicate features, despite their waste, were firmly moulded.<br><br>""What dressings have you been using?"" Linday asked of the woman.<br><br>""Corrosive, sublimate, regular solution,"" came the answer.<br><br>He glanced quickly at her, shot an even quicker glance at the face of the injured man, and stood erect. She breathed sharply, abruptly biting off the respiration with an effort of will. Linday turned to the men.<br><br>""You clear out--chop wood or something. Clear out.""<br><br>One of them demurred.<br><br>""This is a serious case,"" Linday went on. ""I want to talk to his wife.""<br><br>""I'm his brother,"" said the other.<br><br>To him the woman looked, praying him with her eyes. He nodded reluctantly and turned toward the door.<br><br>""Me, too?"" Daw queried from the bench where he had flung himself down.<br><br>""You, too.""<br><br>Linday busied himself with a superficial examination of the patient while the cabin was emptying.<br><br>""So?"" he said. ""So that's your Rex Strang.""<br><br>She dropped her eyes to the man in the bunk as if to reassure herself of his identity, and then in silence returned Linday's gaze.<br><br>""Why don't you speak?""<br><br>She shrugged her shoulders. ""What is the use? You know it is Rex Strang.""<br><br>""Thank you. Though I might remind you that it is the first time I have ever seen him. Sit down."" He waved her to a stool, himself taking the bench. ""I'm really about all in, you know. There's no turnpike from the Yukon here.""<br><br>He drew a penknife and began extracting a thorn from his thumb.<br><br>""What are you going to do?"" she asked, after a minute's wait.<br><br>""Eat and rest up before I start back.""<br><br>""What are you going to do about...."" She inclined her head toward the unconscious man.<br><br>""Nothing.""<br><br>She went over to the bunk and rested her fingers lightly on the tight-curled hair.<br><br>""You mean you will kill him,"" she said slowly. ""Kill him by doing nothing, for you can save him if you will.""<br><br>""Take it that way."" He considered a moment, and stated his thought with a harsh little laugh. ""From time immemorial in this weary old world it has been a not uncommon custom so to dispose of wife-stealers.""<br><br>""You are unfair, Grant,"" she answered gently. ""You forget that I was willing and that I desired. I was a free agent. Rex never stole me. It was you who lost me. I went with him, willing and eager, with song on my lips. As well accuse me of stealing him. We went together.""<br><br>""A good way of looking at it,"" Linday conceded. ""I see you are as keen a thinker as ever, Madge. That must have bothered him.""<br><br>""A keen thinker can be a good lover--""<br><br>""And not so foolish,"" he broke in.<br><br>""Then you admit the wisdom of my course?""<br><br>He threw up his hands. ""That's the devil of it, talking with clever women. A man always forgets and traps himself. I wouldn't wonder if you won him with a syllogism.""<br><br>Her reply was the hint of a smile in her straight-looking blue eyes and a seeming emanation of sex pride from all the physical being of her.<br><br>""No, I take that back, Madge. If you'd been a numbskull you'd have won him, or any one else, on your looks, and form, and carriage. I ought to know. I've been through that particular mill, and, the devil take me, I'm not through it yet.""<br><br>His speech was quick and nervous and irritable, as it always was, and, as she knew, it was always candid. She took her cue from his last remark.<br><br>""Do you remember Lake Geneva?""<br><br>""I ought to. I was rather absurdly happy.""<br><br>She nodded, and her eyes were luminous. ""There is such a thing as old sake. Won't you, Grant, please, just remember back ... a little ... oh, so little ... of what we were to each other ... then?""<br><br>""Now you're taking advantage,"" he smiled, and returned to the attack on his thumb. He drew the thorn out, inspected it critically, then concluded. ""No, thank you. I'm not playing the Good Samaritan.""<br><br>""Yet you made this hard journey for an unknown man,"" she urged.<br><br>His impatience was sharply manifest. ""Do you fancy I'd have moved a step had I known he was my wife's lover?""<br><br>""But you are here ... now. And there he lies. What are you going to do?""<br><br>""Nothing. Why should I? I am not at the man's service. He pilfered me.""<br><br>She was about to speak, when a knock came on the door.<br><br>""Get out!"" he shouted.<br><br>""If you want any assistance--""<br><br>""Get out! Get a bucket of water! Set it down outside!""<br><br>""You are going to...?"" she began tremulously.<br><br>""Wash up.""<br><br>She recoiled from the brutality, and her lips tightened.<br><br>""Listen, Grant,"" she said steadily. ""I shall tell his brother. I know the Strang breed. If you can forget old sake, so can I. If you don't do something, he'll kill you. Why, even Tom Daw would if I asked.""<br><br>""You should know me better than to threaten,"" he reproved gravely, then added, with a sneer: ""Besides, I don't see how killing me will help your Rex Strang.""<br><br>She gave a low gasp, closed her lips tightly, and watched his quick eyes take note of the trembling that had beset her.<br><br>""It's not hysteria, Grant,"" she cried hastily and anxiously, with clicking teeth. ""You never saw me with hysteria. I've never had it. I don't know what it is, but I'll control it. I am merely beside myself. It's partly anger--with you. And it's apprehension and fear. I don't want to lose him. I do love him, Grant. He is my king, my lover. And I have sat here beside him so many dreadful days now. Oh, Grant, please, please.""<br><br>""Just nerves,"" he commented drily. ""Stay with it. You can best it. If you were a man I'd say take a smoke.""<br><br>She went unsteadily back to the stool, where she watched him and fought for control. From the rough fireplace came the singing of a cricket. Outside two wolf-dogs bickered. The injured man's chest rose and fell perceptibly under the fur robes. She saw a smile, not altogether pleasant, form on Linday's lips.<br><br>""How much do you love him?"" he asked.<br><br>Her breast filled and rose, and her eyes shone with a light unashamed and proud. He nodded in token that he was answered.<br><br>""Do you mind if I take a little time?"" He stopped, casting about for the way to begin. ""I remember reading a story--Herbert Shaw wrote it, I think. I want to tell you about it. There was a woman, young and beautiful; a man magnificent, a lover of beauty and a wanderer. I don't know how much like your Rex Strang he was, but I fancy a sort of resemblance. Well, this man was a painter, a bohemian, a vagabond. He kissed--oh, several times and for several weeks--and rode away. She possessed for him what I thought you possessed for me ... at Lake Geneva. In ten years she wept the beauty out of her face. Some women turn yellow, you know, when grief upsets their natural juices.<br><br>""Now it happened that the man went blind, and ten years afterward, led as a child by the hand, he stumbled back to her. There was nothing left. He could no longer paint. And she was very happy, and glad he could not see her face. Remember, he worshipped beauty. And he continued to hold her in his arms and believe in her beauty. The memory of it was vivid in him. He never ceased to talk about it, and to lament that he could not behold it.<br><br>""One day he told her of five great pictures he wished to paint. If only his sight could be restored to paint them, he could write <i>finis</i> and be content. And then, no matter how, there came into her hands an elixir. Anointed on his eyes, the sight would surely and fully return.""<br><br>Linday shrugged his shoulders.<br><br>""You see her struggle. With sight, he could paint his five pictures. Also, he would leave her. Beauty was his religion. It was impossible that he could abide her ruined face. Five days she struggled. Then she anointed his eyes.""<br><br>Linday broke off and searched her with his eyes, the high lights focused sharply in the brilliant black.<br><br>""The question is, do you love Rex Strang as much as that?""<br><br>""And if I do?"" she countered.<br><br>""Do you?""<br><br>""Yes.""<br><br>""You can sacrifice? You can give him up?""<br><br>Slow and reluctant was her ""Yes.""<br><br>""And you will come with me?""<br><br>""Yes."" This time her voice was a whisper. ""When he is well--yes.""<br><br>""You understand. It must be Lake Geneva over again. You will be my wife.""<br><br>She seemed to shrink and droop, but her head nodded.<br><br>""Very well."" He stood up briskly, went to his pack, and began unstrapping. ""I shall need help. Bring his brother in. Bring them all in. Boiling water--let there be lots of it. I've brought bandages, but let me see what you have in that line.--Here, Daw, build up that fire and start boiling all the water you can.--Here you,"" to the other man, ""get that table out and under the window there. Clean it; scrub it; scald it. Clean, man, clean, as you never cleaned a thing before. You, Mrs. Strang, will be my helper. No sheets, I suppose. Well, we'll manage somehow.--You're his brother, sir. I'll give the anaesthetic, but you must keep it going afterward. Now listen, while I instruct you. In the first place--but before that, can you take a pulse?...""<br><br>Noted for his daring and success as a surgeon, through the days and weeks that followed Linday exceeded himself in daring and success. Never, because of the frightful mangling and breakage, and because of the long delay, had he encountered so terrible a case. But he had never had a healthier specimen of human wreck to work upon. Even then he would have failed, had it not been for the patient's catlike vitality and almost uncanny physical and mental grip on life.<br><br>There were days of high temperature and delirium; days of heart-sinking when Strang's pulse was barely perceptible; days when he lay conscious, eyes weary and drawn, the sweat of pain on his face. Linday was indefatigable, cruelly efficient, audacious and fortunate, daring hazard after hazard and winning. He was not content to make the man live. He devoted himself to the intricate and perilous problem of making him whole and strong again.<br><br>""He will be a cripple?"" Madge queried.<br><br>""He will not merely walk and talk and be a limping caricature of his former self,"" Linday told her. ""He shall run and leap, swim riffles, ride bears, fight panthers, and do all things to the top of his fool desire. And, I warn you, he will fascinate women just as of old. Will you like that? Are you content? Remember, you will not be with him.""<br><br>""Go on, go on,"" she breathed. ""Make him whole. Make him what he was.""<br><br>More than once, whenever Strang's recuperation permitted, Linday put him under the anaesthetic and did terrible things, cutting and sewing, rewiring and connecting up the disrupted organism. Later, developed a hitch in the left arm. Strang could lift it so far, and no farther. Linday applied himself to the problem. It was a case of more wires, shrunken, twisted, disconnected. Again it was cut and switch and ease and disentangle. And all that saved Strang was his tremendous vitality and the health of his flesh.<br><br>""You will kill him,"" his brother complained. ""Let him be. For God's sake let him be. A live and crippled man is better than a whole and dead one.""<br><br>Linday flamed in wrath. ""You get out! Out of this cabin with you till you can come back and say that I make him live. Pull--by God, man, you've got to pull with me with all your soul. Your brother's travelling a hairline razor-edge. Do you understand? A thought can topple him off. Now get out, and come back sweet and wholesome, convinced beyond all absoluteness that he will live and be what he was before you and he played the fool together. Get out, I say.""<br><br>The brother, with clenched hands and threatening eyes, looked to Madge for counsel.<br><br>""Go, go, please,"" she begged. ""He is right. I know he is right.""<br><br>Another time, when Strang's condition seemed more promising, the brother said:<br><br>""Doc, you're a wonder, and all this time I've forgotten to ask your name.""<br><br>""None of your damn business. Don't bother me. Get out.""<br><br>The mangled right arm ceased from its healing, burst open again in a frightful wound.<br><br>""Necrosis,"" said Linday.<br><br>""That does settle it,"" groaned the brother.<br><br>""Shut up!"" Linday snarled. ""Get out! Take Daw with you. Take Bill, too. Get rabbits--alive--healthy ones. Trap them. Trap everywhere.""<br><br>""How many?"" the brother asked.<br><br>""Forty of them--four thousand--forty thousand--all you can get. You'll help me, Mrs. Strang. I'm going to dig into that arm and size up the damage. Get out, you fellows. You for the rabbits.""<br><br>And he dug in, swiftly, unerringly, scraping away disintegrating bone, ascertaining the extent of the active decay.<br><br>""It never would have happened,"" he told Madge, ""if he hadn't had so many other things needing vitality first. Even he didn't have vitality enough to go around. I was watching it, but I had to wait and chance it. That piece must go. He could manage without it, but rabbit-bone will make it what it was.""<br><br>From the hundreds of rabbits brought in, he weeded out, rejected, selected, tested, selected and tested again, until he made his final choice. He used the last of his chloroform and achieved the bone-graft--living bone to living bone, living man and living rabbit immovable and indissolubly bandaged and bound together, their mutual processes uniting and reconstructing a perfect arm.<br><br>And through the whole trying period, especially as Strang mended, occurred passages of talk between Linday and Madge. Nor was he kind, nor she rebellious.<br><br>""It's a nuisance,"" he told her. ""But the law is the law, and you'll need a divorce before we can marry again. What do you say? Shall we go to Lake Geneva?""<br><br>""As you will,"" she said.<br><br>And he, another time: ""What the deuce did you see in him anyway? I know he had money. But you and I were managing to get along with some sort of comfort. My practice was averaging around forty thousand a year then--I went over the books afterward. Palaces and steam yachts were about all that was denied you.""<br><br>""Perhaps you've explained it,"" she answered. ""Perhaps you were too interested in your practice. Maybe you forgot me.""<br><br>""Humph,"" he sneered. ""And may not your Rex be too interested in panthers and short sticks?""<br><br>He continually girded her to explain what he chose to call her infatuation for the other man.<br><br>""There is no explanation,"" she replied. And, finally, she retorted, ""No one can explain love, I least of all. I only knew love, the divine and irrefragable fact, that is all. There was once, at Fort Vancouver, a baron of the Hudson Bay Company who chided the resident Church of England parson. The dominie had written home to England complaining that the Company folk, from the head factor down, were addicted to Indian wives. 'Why didn't you explain the extenuating circumstances?' demanded the baron. Replied the dominie: 'A cow's tail grows downward. I do not attempt to explain why the cow's tail grows downward. I merely cite the fact.'""<br><br>""Damn clever women!"" cried Linday, his eyes flashing his irritation.<br><br>""What brought you, of all places, into the Klondike?"" she asked once.<br><br>""Too much money. No wife to spend it. Wanted a rest. Possibly overwork. I tried Colorado, but their telegrams followed me, and some of them did themselves. I went on to Seattle. Same thing. Ransom ran his wife out to me in a special train. There was no escaping it. Operation successful. Local newspapers got wind of it. You can imagine the rest. I had to hide, so I ran away to Klondike. And--well, Tom Daw found me playing whist in a cabin down on the Yukon.""<br><br>Came the day when Strang's bed was carried out of doors and into the sunshine.<br><br>""Let me tell him now,"" she said to Linday.<br><br>""No; wait,"" he answered.<br><br>Later, Strang was able to sit up on the edge of the bed, able to walk his first giddy steps, supported on either side.<br><br>""Let me tell him now,"" she said.<br><br>""No. I'm making a complete job of this. I want no set-backs. There's a slight hitch still in that left arm. It's a little thing, but I am going to remake him as God made him. Tomorrow I've planned to get into that arm and take out the kink. It will mean a couple of days on his back. I'm sorry there's no more chloroform. He'll just have to bite his teeth on a spike and hang on. He can do it. He's got grit for a dozen men.""<br><br>Summer came on. The snow disappeared, save on the far peaks of the Rockies to the east. The days lengthened till there was no darkness, the sun dipping at midnight, due north, for a few minutes beneath the horizon. Linday never let up on Strang. He studied his walk, his body movements, stripped him again and again and for the thousandth time made him flex all his muscles. Massage was given him without end, until Linday declared that Tom Daw, Bill, and the brother were properly qualified for Turkish bath and osteopathic hospital attendants. But Linday was not yet satisfied. He put Strang through his whole repertoire of physical feats, searching him the while for hidden weaknesses. He put him on his back again for a week, opened up his leg, played a deft trick or two with the smaller veins, scraped a spot of bone no larger than a coffee grain till naught but a surface of healthy pink remained to be sewed over with the living flesh.<br><br>""Let me tell him,"" Madge begged.<br><br>""Not yet,"" was the answer. ""You will tell him only when I am ready.""<br><br>July passed, and August neared its end, when he ordered Strang out on trail to get a moose. Linday kept at his heels, watching him, studying him. He was slender, a cat in the strength of his muscles, and he walked as Linday had seen no man walk, effortlessly, with all his body, seeming to lift the legs with supple muscles clear to the shoulders. But it was without heaviness, so easy that it invested him with a peculiar grace, so easy that to the eye the speed was deceptive. It was the killing pace of which Tom Daw had complained. Linday toiled behind, sweating and panting; from time to time, when the ground favoured, making short runs to keep up. At the end of ten miles he called a halt and threw himself down on the moss.<br><br>""Enough!"" he cried. ""I can't keep up with you.""<br><br>He mopped his heated face, and Strang sat down on a spruce log, smiling at the doctor, and, with the camaraderie of a pantheist, at all the landscape.<br><br>""Any twinges, or hurts, or aches, or hints of aches?"" Linday demanded.<br><br>Strang shook his curly head and stretched his lithe body, living and joying in every fibre of it.<br><br>""You'll do, Strang. For a winter or two you may expect to feel the cold and damp in the old wounds. But that will pass, and perhaps you may escape it altogether.""<br><br>""God, Doctor, you have performed miracles with me. I don't know how to thank you. I don't even know your name.""<br><br>""Which doesn't matter. I've pulled you through, and that's the main thing.""<br><br>""But it's a name men must know out in the world,"" Strang persisted. ""I'll wager I'd recognise it if I heard it.""<br><br>""I think you would,"" was Linday's answer. ""But it's beside the matter. I want one final test, and then I'm done with you. Over the divide at the head of this creek is a tributary of the Big Windy. Daw tells me that last year you went over, down to the middle fork, and back again, in three days. He said you nearly killed him, too. You are to wait here and camp to-night. I'll send Daw along with the camp outfit. Then it's up to you to go to the middle fork and back in the same time as last year.""<br><br>""Now,"" Linday said to Madge. ""You have an hour in which to pack. I'll go and get the canoe ready. Bill's bringing in the moose and won't get back till dark. We'll make my cabin to-day, and in a week we'll be in Dawson.""<br><br>""I was in hope...."" She broke off proudly.<br><br>""That I'd forego the fee?""<br><br>""Oh, a compact is a compact, but you needn't have been so hateful in the collecting. You have not been fair. You have sent him away for three days, and robbed me of my last words to him.""<br><br>""Leave a letter.""<br><br>""I shall tell him all.""<br><br>""Anything less than all would be unfair to the three of us,"" was Linday's answer.<br><br>When he returned from the canoe, her outfit was packed, the letter written.<br><br>""Let me read it,"" he said, ""if you don't mind.""<br><br>Her hesitation was momentary, then she passed it over.<br><br>""Pretty straight,"" he said, when he had finished it. ""Now, are you ready?""<br><br>He carried her pack down to the bank, and, kneeling, steadied the canoe with one hand while he extended the other to help her in. He watched her closely, but without a tremor she held out her hand to his and prepared to step on board.<br><br>""Wait,"" he said. ""One moment. You remember the story I told you of the elixir. I failed to tell you the end. And when she had anointed his eyes and was about to depart, it chanced she saw in the mirror that her beauty had been restored to her. And he opened his eyes, and cried out with joy at the sight of her beauty, and folded her in his arms.""<br><br>She waited, tense but controlled, for him to continue, a dawn of wonder faintly beginning to show in her face and eyes.<br><br>""You are very beautiful, Madge."" He paused, then added drily, ""The rest is obvious. I fancy Rex Strang's arms won't remain long empty. Good-bye.""<br><br>""Grant...."" she said, almost whispered, and in her voice was all the speech that needs not words for understanding.<br><br>He gave a nasty little laugh. ""I just wanted to show you I wasn't such a bad sort. Coals of fire, you know.""<br><br>""Grant....""<br><br>He stepped into the canoe and put out a slender, nervous hand.<br><br>""Good-bye,"" he said.<br><br>She folded both her own hands about his.<br><br>""Dear, strong hand,"" she murmured, and bent and kissed it.<br><br>He jerked it away, thrust the canoe out from the bank, dipped the paddle in the swift rush of the current, and entered the head of the riffle where the water poured glassily ere it burst into a white madness of foam.<br><br>"
41,The Mexican,"NOBODY knew his history-- they of the Junta least of all. He was their ""little mystery,"" their ""big patriot,"" and in his way he worked as hard for the coming Mexican Revolution as did they. They were tardy in recognizing this, for not one of the Junta liked him. The day he first drifted into their crowded, busy rooms, they all suspected him of being a spy--one of the bought tools of the Diaz secret service. Too many of the comrades were in civil an military prisons scattered over the United States, and others of them, in irons, were even then being taken across the border to be lined up against adobe walls and shot.    At the first sight the boy did not impress them favorably. Boy he was, not more than eighteen and not over large for his years. He announced that he was Felipe Rivera, and that it was his wish to work for the Revolution. That was all--not a wasted word, no further explanation. He stood waiting. There was no smile on his lips, no geniality in his eyes. Big dashing Paulino Vera felt an inward shudder. Here was something forbidding, terrible, inscrutable. There was something venomous and snakelike in the boy's black eyes. They burned like cold fire, as with a vast, concentrated bitterness. He flashed them from the faces of the conspirators to the typewriter which little Mrs. Sethby was industriously operating. His eyes rested on hers but an instant--she had chanced to look up--and she, too, sensed the nameless something that made her pause. She was compelled to read back in order to regain the swing of the letter she was writing.    Paulino Vera looked questioningly at Arrellano and Ramos, and questioningly they looked back and to each other. The indecision of doubt brooded in their eyes. This slender boy was the Unknown, vested with all the menace of the Unknown. He was unrecognizable, something quite beyond the ken of honest, ordinary revolutionists whose fiercest hatred for Diaz and his tyranny after all was only that of honest and ordinary patriots. Here was something else, they knew not what. But Vera, always the most impulsive, the quickest to act, stepped into the breach.    ""Very well,"" he said coldly. ""You say you want to work for the Revolution. Take off your coat. Hang it over there. I will show you, come--where are the buckets and cloths. The floor is dirty. You will begin by scrubbing it, and by scrubbing the floors of the other rooms. The spittoons need to be cleaned. Then there are the windows.""    ""Is it for the Revolution?"" the boy asked.    ""It is for the Revolution,"" Vera answered.    Rivera looked cold suspicion at all of them, then proceeded to take off his coat.    ""It is well,"" he said.    And nothing more. Day after day he came to his work--sweeping, scrubbing, cleaning. He emptied the ashes from the stoves, brought up the coal and kindling, and lighted the fires before the most energetic one of them was at his desk.    ""Can I sleep here?"" he asked once.    Ah, ha! So that was it--the hand of Diaz showing through! To sleep in the rooms of the Junta meant access to their secrets, to the lists of names, to the addresses of comrades down on Mexican soil. The request was denied, and Rivera never spoke of it again. He slept they knew not where, and ate they knew not where nor how. Once, Arrellano offered him a couple of dollars. Rivera declined the money with a shake of the head. When Vera joined in and tried to press it upon him, he said:    ""I am working for the Revolution.""    It takes money to raise a modern revolution. and always the Junta was pressed. The members starved and toiled, and the longest day was none too long, and yet there were times when it appeared as if the Revolution stood or fell on no more than the matter of a few dollars. Once, the first time, when the rent of the house was two months behind and the landlord was threatening dispossession, it was Felipe Rivera, the scrub-boy in the poor, cheap clothes, worn and threadbare, who laid sixty dollars in gold on May Sethby's desk. There were other times. Three hundred letters, clicked out on the busy typewriters (appeals for assistance, for sanctions from the organized labor groups, requests for square news deals to the editors of newspapers, protests against the high-handed treatment of revolutionists by the United States courts), lay unmailed, awaiting postage. Vera's watch had disappeared--the old-fashioned gold repeater that had been his father's. Likewise had gone the plain gold band from May Setbby's third finger. Things were desperate. Ramos and Arrellano pulled their long mustaches in despair. The letters must go off, and the Post Office allowed no credit to purchasers of stamps. Then it was that Rivera put on his hat and went out. When he came back he laid a thousand two-cent stamps on May Sethby's desk.    ""I wonder if it is the cursed gold of Diaz?"" said Vera to the comrades.    They elevated their brows and could not decide. And Felipe Rivera, the scrubber for the Revolution, continued, as occasion arose, to lay down gold and silver for the Junta's use.    And still they could not bring themselves to like him. They did not know him. His ways were not theirs. He gave no confidences. He repelled all probing. Youth that he was, they could never nerve themselves to dare to question him.    ""A great and lonely spirit, perhaps, I do not know, I do not know,"" Arrellano said helplessly.    ""He is not human,"" said Ramos.    ""His soul has been seared,"" said May Sethby. ""Light and laughter have been burned out of him. He is like one dead, and yet he is fearfully alive.""    ""He has been through hell,"" said Vera. ""No man could look like that who has not been through hell--and he is only a boy.""    Yet they could not like him. He never talked, never inquired, never suggested. He would stand listening, expressionless, a thing dead, save for his eyes, coldly burning, while their talk of the Revolution ran high and warm. From face to face and speaker to speaker his eyes would turn, boring like gimlets of incandescent ice, disconcerting and perturbing.    ""He is no spy,"" Vera confided to May Sethby. ""He is a patriot--mark me, the greatest patriot of us all. I know it, I feel it, here in my heart and head I feel it. But him I know not at all.""    ""He has a bad temper,"" said May Sethby.    ""I know,"" said Vera, with a shudder. ""He has looked at me with those eyes of his. They do not love; they threaten; they are savage as a wild tiger's. I know, if I should prove unfaithful to the Cause, that he would kill me. He has no heart. He is pitiless as steel, keen and cold as frost. He is like moonshine in a winter night when a man freezes to death on some lonely mountain top. I am not afraid of Diaz and all his killers; but this boy, of him am I afraid. I tell you true. I am afraid. He is the breath of death.""    Yet Vera it was who persuaded the others to give the first trust to Rivera. The line of communication between Los Angeles and Lower California had broken down. Three of the comrades had dug their own graves and been shot into them. Two more were United States prisoners in Los Angeles. Juan Alvarado, the Federal commander, was a monster. All their plans did he checkmate. They could no longer gain access to the active revolutionists, and the incipient ones, in Lower California.    Young Rivera was given his instructions and dispatched south. When he returned, the line of communication was reestablished, and Juan Alvarado was dead. He had been found in bed, a knife hilt-deep in his breast. This had exceeded Rivera's instructions, but they of the Junta knew the times of his movements. They did not ask him. He said nothing. But they looked at one another and conjectured.    ""I have told you,"" said Vera. ""Diaz has more to fear from this youth than from any man. He is implacable. He is the hand of God.""    The bad temper, mentioned by May Sethby, and sensed by them all, was evidenced by physical proofs. Now he appeared with a cut lip, a blackened cheek, or a swollen ear. It was patent that he brawled, somewhere in that outside world where he ate and slept, gained money, and moved in ways unknown to them. As the time passed, he had come to set type for the little revolutionary sheet they published weekly. There were occasions when he was unable to set type, when his knuckles were bruised and battered, when his thumbs were injured and helpless, when one arm or the other hung wearily at his side while his face was drawn with unspoken pain.    ""A wastrel,"" said Arrellano.    ""A frequenter of low places,"" said Ramos.    ""But where does he get the money?"" Vera demanded. ""Only to-day, just now, have I learned that he paid the bill for white paper--one hundred and forty dollars.""    ""There are his absences,"" said May Sethby. ""He never explains them.""    ""We should set a spy upon him,"" Ramos propounded.    ""I should not care to be that spy,"" said Vera. ""I fear you would never see me again, save to bury me. He has a terrible passion. Not even God would he permit to stand between him and the way of his passion.""    ""I feel like a child before him,"" Ramos confessed.    ""To me he is power--he is the primitive, the wild wolf, the striking rattlesnake, the stinging centipede,"" said Arrellano.    ""He is the Revolution incarnate,"" said Vera. ""He is the flame and the spirit of it, the insatiable cry for vengeance that makes no cry but that slays noiselessly. He is a destroying angel in moving through the still watches of the night.""    ""I could weep over him,"" said May Sethby. ""He knows nobody. He hates all people. Us he tolerates, for we are the way of his desire. He is alone. . . . lonely."" Her voice broke in a half sob and there was dimness in her eyes.    Rivera's ways and times were truly mysterious. There were periods when they did not see him for a week at a time. Once, he was away a month. These occasions were always capped by his return, when, without advertisement or speech, he laid gold coins on May Sethby's desk. Again, for days and weeks, he spent all his time with the Junta. And yet again, for irregular periods, he would disappear through the heart of each day, from early morning until late afternoon. At such times he came early and remained late. Arrellano had found him at midnight, setting type with fresh swollen knuckles, or mayhap it was his lip, new-split, that still bled.    <b>II</b>    The time of the crisis approached. Whether or not the Revolution would be depended upon the Junta, and the Junta was hard-pressed. The need for money was greater than ever before, while money was harder to get. Patriots had given their last cent and now could give no more. Section gang laborers-fugitive peons from Mexico--were contributing half their scanty wages. But more than that was needed. The heart-breaking, conspiring, undermining toil of years approached fruition. The time was ripe. The Revolution hung on the balance. One shove more, one last heroic effort, and it would tremble across the scales to victory. They knew their Mexico. Once started, the Revolution would take care of itself. The whole Diaz machine would go down like a house of cards. The border was ready to rise. One Yankee, with a hundred I.W.W. men, waited the word to cross over the border and begin the conquest of Lower California. But he needed guns. And clear across to the Atlantic, the Junta in touch with them all and all of them needing guns, mere adventurers, soldiers of fortune, bandits, disgruntled American union men, socialists, anarchists, rough-necks, Mexican exiles, peons escaped from bondage, whipped miners from the bull-pens of Coeur d'Alene and Colorado who desired only the more vindictively to fight--all the flotsam and jetsam of wild spirits from the madly complicated modern world. And it was guns and ammunition, ammunition and guns--the unceasing and eternal cry.    Fling this heterogeneous, bankrupt, vindictive mass across the border, and the Revolution was on. The custom house, the northern ports of entry, would be captured. Diaz could not resist. He dared not throw the weight of his armies against them, for he must hold the south. And through the south the flame would spread despite. The people would rise. The defenses of city after city would crumple up. State after state would totter down. And at last, from every side, the victorious armies of the Revolution would close in on the City of Mexico itself, Diaz's last stronghold.    But the money. They had the men, impatient and urgent, who would use the guns. They knew the traders who would sell and deliver the guns. But to culture the Revolution thus far had exhausted the Junta. The last dollar had been spent, the last resource and the last starving patriot milked dry, and the great adventure still trembled on the scales. Guns and ammunition! The ragged battalions must be armed. But how? Ramos lamented his confiscated estates. Arrellano wailed the spendthriftness of his youth. May Sethby wondered if it would have been different had they of the Junta been more economical in the past.    ""To think that the freedom of Mexico should stand or fall on a few paltry thousands of dollars,"" said Paulino Vera.    Despair was in all their faces. Jose Amarillo, their last hope, a recent convert, who had promised money, had been apprehended at his hacienda in Chihuahua and shot against his own stable wall. The news had just come through.    Rivera, on his knees, scrubbing, looked up, with suspended brush, his bare arms flecked with soapy, dirty water.    ""Will five thousand do it?"" he asked.    They looked their amazement. Vera nodded and swallowed. He could not speak, but he was on the instant invested with a vast faith.    ""Order the guns,"" Rivera said, and thereupon was guilty of the longest flow of words they had ever heard him utter. ""The time is short. In three weeks I shall bring you the five thousand. It is well. The weather will be warmer for those who fight. Also, it is the best I can do.""    Vera fought his faith. It was incredible. Too many fond hopes had been shattered since he had begun to play the revolution game. He believed this threadbare scrubber of the Revolution, and yet he dared not believe.    ""You are crazy,"" he said.    ""In three weeks,"" said Rivera. ""Order the guns.""    He got up, rolled down his sleeves, and put on his coat.    ""Order the guns,"" he said.    ""I am going now.""    <b>III</b>    After hurrying and scurrying, much telephoning and bad language, a night session was held in Kelly's office. Kelly was rushed with business; also, he was unlucky. He had brought Danny Ward out from New York, arranged the fight for him with Billy Carthey, the date was three weeks away, and for two days now, carefully concealed from the sporting writers, Carthey had been lying up, badly injured. There was no one to take his place. Kelly had been burning the wires East to every eligible lightweight, but they were tied up with dates and contracts. And now hope had revived, though faintly.    ""You've got a hell of a nerve,"" Kelly addressed Rivera, after one look, as soon as they got together.    Hate that was malignant was in Rivera's eyes, but his face remained impassive.    ""I can lick Ward,"" was all he said.    ""How do you know? Ever see him fight?""    Rivera shook his head.    ""He can beat you up with one hand and both eyes closed.""    Rivera shrugged his shoulders.    ""Haven't you got anything to say?"" the fight promoter snarled.    ""I can lick him.""    ""Who'd you ever fight, anyway!"" Michael Kelly demanded. Michael was the promotor's brother, and ran the Yellowstone pool rooms where he made goodly sums on the fight game.    Rivera favored him with a bitter, unanswering stare.    The promoter's secretary, a distinctively sporty young man, sneered audibly.    ""Well, you know Roberts,"" Kelly broke the hostile silence. ""He ought to be here. I've sent for him. Sit down and wait, though f rom the looks of you, you haven't got a chance. I can't throw the public down with a bum fight. Ringside seats are selling at fifteen dollars, you know that.""    When Roberts arrived, it was patent that he was mildly drunk. He was a tall, lean, slack-jointed individual, and his walk, like his talk, was a smooth and languid drawl.    Kelly went straight to the point.    ""Look here, Roberts, you've been bragging you discovered this little Mexican. You know Carthey's broke his arm. Well, this little yellow streak has the gall to blow in to-day and say he'll take Carthey's place. What about it?""    ""It's all right, Kelly,"" came the slow response. ""He can put up a fight.""    ""I suppose you'll be sayin' next that he can lick Ward,"" Kelly snapped.    Roberts considered judicially.    ""No, I won't say that. Ward's a top-notcher and a ring general. But he can't hashhouse Rivera in short order. I know Rivera. Nobody can get his goat. He ain't got a goat that I could ever discover. And he's a two-handed fighter. He can throw in the sleep-makers from any position.""    ""Never mind that. What kind of a show can he put up? You've been conditioning and training fighters all your life. I take off my hat to your judgment. Can he give the public a run for its money?""    ""He sure can, and he'll worry Ward a mighty heap on top of it. You don't know that boy. I do. I discovered him. He ain't got a goat. He's a devil. He's a wizzy-wooz if anybody should ask you. He'll make Ward sit up with a show of local talent that'll make the rest of you sit up. I won't say he'll lick Ward, but he'll put up such a show that you'll all know he's a comer.""    ""All right."" Kelly turned to his secretary. ""Ring up Ward. I warned him to show up if I thought it worth while. He's right across at the Yellowstone, throwin' chests and doing the popular.""    Kelly turned back to the conditioner. ""Have a drink?""    Roberts sipped his highball and unburdened himself.    ""Never told you how I discovered the little cuss. It was a couple of years ago he showed up out at the quarters. I was getting Prayne ready for his fight with Delaney. Prayne's wicked. He ain't got a tickle of mercy in his make-up. I chopped up his pardner's something cruel, and I couldn't find a willing boy that'd work with him. I'd noticed this little starved Mexican kid hanging around, and I was desperate. So I grabbed him, shoved on the gloves and put him in. He was tougher'n rawhide, but weak. And he didn't know the first letter in the alphabet of boxing. Prayne chopped him to ribbons. But he hung on for two sickening rounds, when he fainted. Starvation, that was all. Battered! You couldn't have recognized him. I gave him half a dollar and a square meal. You oughta seen him wolf it down. He hadn't had the end of a bite for a couple of days. That's the end of him, thinks I. But next day he showed up, stiff an' sore, ready for another half and a square meal. And he done better as time went by. Just a born fighter, and tough beyond belief. He hasn't a heart. He's a piece of ice. And he never talked eleven words in a string since I know him. He saws wood and does his work.""    ""I've seen 'm,"" the secretary said. ""He's worked a lot for you.""    ""All the big little fellows has tried out on him,"" Roberts answered. ""And he's learned from 'em. I've seen some of them he could lick. But his heart wasn't in it. I reckoned he never liked the game. He seemed to act that way.""    ""He's been fighting some before the little clubs the last few months,"" Kelly said.    ""Sure. But I don't know what struck 'm. All of a sudden his heart got into it. He just went out like a streak and cleaned up all the little local fellows. Seemed to want the money, and he's won a bit, though his clothes don't look it. He's peculiar. Nobody knows his business. Nobody knows how he spends his time. Even when he's on the job, he plumb up and disappears most of each day soon as his work is done. Sometimes he just blows away for weeks at a time. But he don't take advice. There's a fortune in it for the fellow that gets the job of managin' him, only he won't consider it. And you watch him hold out for the cash money when you get down to terms.""    It was at this stage that Danny Ward arrived. Quite a party it was. His manager and trainer were with him, and he breezed in like a gusty draught of geniality, good-nature, and all-conqueringness. Greetings flew about, a joke here, a retort there, a smile or a laugh for everybody. Yet it was his way, and only partly sincere. He was a good actor, and he had found geniality a most valuable asset in the game of getting on in the world. But down underneath he was the deliberate, cold-blooded fighter and business man. The rest was a mask. Those who knew him or trafficked with him said that when it came to brass tacks he was Danny-on-the-Spot. He was invariably present at all business discussions, and it was urged by some that his manager was a blind whose only function was to serve as Danny's mouth-piece.    Rivera's way was different. Indian blood, as well as Spanish, was in his veins, and he sat back in a corner, silent, immobile, only his black eyes passing from face to face and noting everything.    ""So that's the guy,"" Danny said, running an appraising eye over his proposed antagonist. ""How de do, old chap.""    Rivera's eyes burned venomously, but he made no sign of acknowledgment. He disliked all Gringos, but this Gringo he hated with an immediacy that was unusual even in him.    ""Gawd!"" Danny protested facetiously to the promoter. ""You ain't expectin' me to fight a deef mute."" When the laughter subsided, he made another hit. ""Los Angeles must be on the dink when this is the best you can scare up. What kindergarten did you get 'm from?""    ""He's a good little boy, Danny, take it from me,"" Roberts defended. ""Not as easy as he looks.""    ""And half the house is sold already,"" Kelly pleaded. ""You'll have to take 'm on, Danny. It is the best we can do.""    Danny ran another careless and unflattering glance over Rivera and sighed.    ""I gotta be easy with 'm, I guess. If only he don't blow up.""    Roberts snorted.    ""You gotta be careful,"" Danny's manager warned. ""No taking chances with a dub that's likely to sneak a lucky one across.""    ""Oh, I'll be careful all right, all right,"" Danny smiled. ""I'll get in at the start an' nurse 'im along for the dear public's sake. What d' ye say to fifteen rounds, Kelly--an' then the hay for him?""    ""That'll do,"" was the answer. ""As long as you make it realistic.""    ""Then let's get down to biz."" Danny paused and calculated. ""Of course, sixty-five per cent of the gate receipts, same as with Carthey. But the split'll be different. Eighty will just about suit me."" And to his manager, ""That right?""    The manager nodded.    ""Here, you, did you get that?"" Kelly asked Rivera.    Rivera shook his head.    ""Well, it is this way,"" Kelly exposited. ""The purse'll be sixty-five per cent of the gate receipts. You're a dub, and an unknown. You and Danny split, twenty per cent goin' to you, an' eighty to Danny. That's fair, isn't it, Roberts?""    ""Very fair, Rivera,"" Roberts agreed.    ""You see, you ain't got a reputation yet.""    ""What will sixty-five per cent of the gate receipts be?"" Rivera demanded.    ""Oh, maybe five thousand, maybe as high as eight thousand,"" Danny broke in to explain. ""Something like that. Your share'll come to something like a thousand or sixteen hundred. Pretty good for takin' a licking from a guy with my reputation. What d' ye say?""    Then Rivera took their breaths away. ""Winner takes all,"" he said with finality.    A dead silence prevailed.    ""It's like candy from a baby,"" Danny's manager proclaimed.    Danny shook his head.    ""I've been in the game too long,"" he explained.    ""I'm not casting reflections on the referee, or the present company. I'm not sayin' nothing about book-makers an' frame-ups that sometimes happen. But what I do say is that it's poor business for a fighter like me. I play safe. There's no tellin'. Mebbe I break my arm, eh? Or some guy slips me a bunch of dope?"" He shook his head solemnly. ""Win or lose, eighty is my split. What d' ye say, Mexican?""    Rivera shook his head.    Danny exploded. He was getting down to brass tacks now.    ""Why, you dirty little greaser! I've a mind to knock your block off right now.""    Roberts drawled his body to interposition between hostilities.    ""Winner takes all,"" Rivera repeated sullenly.    ""Why do you stand out that way?"" Danny asked.    ""I can lick you,"" was the straight answer.    Danny half started to take off his coat. But, as his manager knew, it was a grand stand play. The coat did not come off, and Danny allowed himself to be placated by the group. Everybody sympathized with him. Rivera stood alone.    ""Look here, you little fool,"" Kelly took up the argument. ""You're nobody. We know what you ve been doing the last few months--putting away little local fighters. But Danny is class. His next fight after this will be for the championship. And you're unknown. Nobody ever heard of you out of Los Angeles.""    ""They will,"" Rivera answered with a shrug, ""after this fight.""    ""You think for a second you can lick me?"" Danny blurted in.    Rivera nodded.    ""Oh, come; listen to reason,"" Kelly pleaded. ""Think of the advertising.""    ""I want the money,"" was Rivera's answer.    ""You couldn't win from me in a thousand years,"" Danny assured him.    ""Then what are you holdin' out for?"" Rivera countered. ""If the money's that easy, why don't you go after it?""    ""I will, so help me!"" Danny cried with abrupt conviction. ""I'Il beat you to death in the ring, my boy--you monkeyin' with me this way. Make out the articles, Kelly. Winner take all. Play it up in the sportin' columns. Tell 'em it's a grudge fight. I'll show this fresh kid a few.""    Kelly's secretary had begun to write, when Danny interrupted.    ""Hold on!"" He turned to Rivera.    ""Weights?""    ""Ringside,"" came the answer.    ""Not on your life, Fresh Kid. If winner takes all, we weigh in at ten A.M.""    ""And winner takes all?"" Rivera queried.    Danny nodded. That settled it. He would enter the ring in his full ripeness of strength.    ""Weigh in at ten,"" Rivera said.    The secretary's pen went on scratching.    ""It means five pounds,"" Roberts complained to Rivera.    ""You've given too much away. You've thrown the fight right there. Danny'll lick you sure. He'll be as strong as a bull. You're a fool. You ain't got the chance of a dewdrop in hell.""    Rivera's answer was a calculated look of hatred. Even this Gringo he despised, and him had he found the whitest Gringo of them all.    <b>IV</b>    Barely noticed was Rivera as he entered the ring. Only a very slight and very scattering ripple of half-hearted hand-clapping greeted him. The house did not believe in him. He was the lamb led to slaughter at the hands of the great Danny. Besides, the house was disappointed. It had expected a rushing battle between Danny Ward and Billy Carthey, and here it must put up with this poor little tyro. Still further, it had manifested its disapproval of the change by betting two, and even three, to one on Danny. And where a betting audience's money is, there is its heart.    The Mexican boy sat down in his corner and waited. The slow minutes lagged by. Danny was making him wait. It was an old trick, but ever it worked on the young, new fighters. They grew frightened, sitting thus and facing their own apprehensions and a callous, tobacco-smoking audience. But for once the trick failed. Roberts was right. Rivera had no goat. He, who was more delicately coordinated, more finely nerved and strung than any of them, had no nerves of this sort. The atmosphere of foredoomed defeat in his own corner had no effect on him. His handlers were Gringos and strangers. Also they were scrubs--the dirty driftage of the fight game, without honor, without efficiency. And they were chilled, as well, with certitude that theirs was the losing corner.    ""Now you gotta be careful,"" Spider Hagerty warned him. Spider was his chief second. ""Make it last as long as you can--them's my instructions from Kelly. If you don't, the papers'll call it another bum fight and give the game a bigger black eye in Los Angeles.""    All of which was not encouraging. But Rivera took no notice. He despised prize fighting. It was the hated game of the hated Gringo. He had taken up with it, as a chopping block for others in the training quarters, solely because he was starving. The fact that he was marvelously made for it had meant nothing. He hated it. Not until he had come in to the Junta, had he fought for money, and he had found the money easy. Not first among the sons of men had he been to find himself successful at a despised vocation.    He did not analyze. He merely knew that he must win this fight. There could be no other outcome. For behind him, nerving him to this belief, were profounder forces than any the crowded house dreamed. Danny Ward fought for money, and for the easy ways of life that money would bring. But the things Rivera fought for burned in his brain--blazing and terrible visions, that, with eyes wide open, sitting lonely in the corner of the ring and waiting for his tricky antagonist, he saw as clearly as he had lived them.    He saw the white-walled, water-power factories of Rio Blanco. He saw the six thousand workers, starved and wan, and the little children, seven and eight years of age, who toiled long shifts for ten cents a day. He saw the perambulating corpses, the ghastly death's heads of men who labored in the dye-rooms. He remembered that he had heard his father call the dye-rooms the ""suicide-holes,"" where a year was death. He saw the little patio, and his mother cooking and moiling at crude housekeeping and finding time to caress and love him. And his father he saw, large, big-moustached and deep-chested, kindly above all men, who loved all men and whose heart was so large that there was love to overflowing still left for the mother and the little muchacho playing in the corner of the patio. In those days his name had not been Felipe Rivera. It had been Fernandez, his father's and mother's name. Him had they called Juan. Later, he had changed it himself, for he had found the name of Fernandez hated by prefects of police, jefes politicos, and rurales.    Big, hearty Joaquin Fernandez! A large place he occupied in Rivera's visions. He had not understood at the time, but looking back he could understand. He could see him setting type in the little printery, or scribbling endless hasty, nervous lines on the much-cluttered desk. And he could see the strange evenings, when workmen, coming secretly in the dark like men who did ill deeds, met with his father and talked long hours where he, the muchacho, lay not always asleep in the corner.    As from a remote distance he could hear Spider Hagerty saying to him: ""No layin' down at the start. Them's instructions. Take a beatin' and earn your dough.""    Ten minutes had passed, and he still sat in his comer. There were no signs of Danny, who was evidently playing the trick to the limit.    But more visions burned before the eye of Rivera's memory. The strike, or, rather, the lockout, because the workers of Rio Blanco had helped their striking brothers of Puebla. The hunger, the expeditions in the hills for berries, the roots and herbs that all ate and that twisted and pained the stomachs of all of them. And then, the nightmare; the waste of ground before the company's store; the thousands of starving workers; General Rosalio Martinez and the soldiers of Porfirio Diaz, and the death-spitting rifles that seemed never to cease spitting, while the workers' wrongs were washed and washed again in their own blood. And that night! He saw the flat cars, piled high with the bodies of the slain, consigned to Vera Cruz, food for the sharks of the bay. Again he crawled over the grisly heaps, seeking and finding, stripped and mangled, his father and his mother. His mother he especially remembered--only her face projecting, her body burdened by the weight of dozens of bodies. Again the rifles of the soldiers of Porfirio Diaz cracked, and again he dropped to the ground and slunk away like some hunted coyote of the hills.    To his ears came a great roar, as of the sea, and he saw Danny Ward, leading his retinue of trainers and seconds, coming down the center aisle. The house was in wild uproar for the popular hero who was bound to win. Everybody proclaimed him. Everybody was for him. Even Rivera's own seconds warmed to something akin to cheerfulness when Danny ducked jauntily through the ropes and entered the ring. His face continually spread to an unending succession of smiles, and when Danny smiled he smiled in every feature, even to the laughter-wrinkles of the corners of the eyes and into the depths of the eyes themselves. Never was there so genial a fighter. His face was a running advertisement of good feeling, of good fellowship. He knew everybody. He joked, and laughed, and greeted his friends through the ropes. Those farther away, unable to suppress their admiration, cried loudly: ""Oh, you Danny!"" It was a joyous ovation of affection that lasted a full five minutes.    Rivera was disregarded. For all that the audience noticed, he did not exist. Spider Lagerty's bloated face bent down close to his.    ""No gettin' scared,"" the Spider warned.    ""An' remember instructions. You gotta last. No layin' down. If you lay down, we got instructions to beat you up in the dressing rooms. Savve? You just gotta fight.""    The house began to applaud. Danny was crossing the ring to him. Danny bent over, caught Rivera's right hand in both his own and shook it with impulsive heartiness. Danny's smile-wreathed face was close to his. The audience yelled its appreciation of Danny's display of sporting spirit. He was greeting his opponent with the fondness of a brother. Danny's lips moved, and the audience, interpreting the unheard words to be those of a kindly-natured sport, yelled again. Only Rivera heard the low words.    ""You little Mexican rat,"" hissed from between Danny's gaily smiling lips, ""I'll fetch the yellow outa you.""    Rivera made no move. He did not rise. He merely hated with his eyes.    ""Get up, you dog!"" some man yelled through the ropes from behind.    The crowd began to hiss and boo him for his unsportsmanlike conduct, but he sat unmoved. Another great outburst of applause was Danny's as he walked back across the ring.    When Danny stripped, there was ohs! and ahs! of delight. His body was perfect, alive with easy suppleness and health and strength. The skin was white as a woman's, and as smooth. All grace, and resilience, and power resided therein. He had proved it in scores of battles. His photographs were in all the physical culture magazines.    A groan went up as Spider Hagerty peeled Rivera's sweater over his head. His body seemed leaner, because of the swarthiness of the skin. He had muscles, but they made no display like his opponent's. What the audience neglected to see was the deep chest. Nor could it guess the toughness of the fiber of the flesh, the instantaneousness of the cell explosions of the muscles, the fineness of the nerves that wired every part of him into a spendid fighting mechanism. All the audience saw was a brown-skinned boy of eighteen with what seemed the body of a boy. With Danny it was different. Danny was a man of twenty-four, and his body was a man's body. The contrast was still more striking as they stood together in the center of the ring receiving the referee's last instructions.    Rivera noticed Roberts sitting directly behind the newspaper men. He was drunker than usual, and his speech was correspondingly slower.    ""Take it easy, Rivera,"" Roberts drawled.    ""He can't kill you, remember that. He'll rush you at the go-off, but don't get rattled. You just and stall, and clinch. He can't hurt cover up, much. Just make believe to yourself that he's choppin' out on you at the trainin' quarters.""    Rivera made no sign that he had heard.    ""Sullen little devil,"" Roberts muttered to the man next to him. ""He always was that way.""    But Rivera forgot to look his usual hatred. A vision of countless rifles blinded his eyes. Every face in the aidience, far as he could see, to the high dollar-seats, was transformed into a rifle. And he saw the long Mexican border arid and sun-washed and aching, and along it he saw the ragged bands that delayed only for the guns.    Back in his corner he waited, standing up. His seconds had crawled out through the ropes, taking the canvas stool with them. Diagonally across the squared ring, Danny faced him. The gong struck, and the battle was on. The audience howled its delight. Never had it seen a battle open more convincingly. The papers were right. It was a grudge fight. Three-quarters of the distance Danny covered in the rush to get together, his intention to eat up the Mexican lad plainly advertised. He assailed with not one blow, nor two, nor a dozen. He was a gyroscope of blows, a whirlwind of destruction. Rivera was nowhere. He was overwhelmed, buried beneath avalanches of punches delivered from every angle and position by a past master in the art. He was overborne, swept back against the ropes, separated by the referee, and swept back against the ropes again.    It was not a fight. It was a slaughter, a massacre. Any audience, save a prize fighting one, would have exhausted its emotions in that first minute. Danny was certainly showing what he could do--a splendid exhibition. Such was the certainty of the audience, as well as its excitement and favoritism, that it failed to take notice that the Mexican still stayed on his feet. It forgot Rivera. It rarely saw him, so closely was he enveloped in Danny's man-eating attack. A minute of this went by, and two minutes. Then, in a separation, it caught a clear glimpse of the Mexican. His lip was cut, his nose was bleeding. As he turned and staggered into a clinch, the welts of oozing blood, from his contacts with the ropes, showed in red bars. across his back. But what the audience did not notice was that his chest was not heaving and that his eyes were coldly burning as ever. Too many aspiring champions, in the cruel welter of the training camps, had practiced this man-eating attack on him. He had learned to live through for a compensation of from half a dollar a go up to fifteen dollars a week--a hard school, and he was schooled hard.    Then happened the amazing thing. The whirling, blurring mix-up ceased suddenly. Rivera stood alone. Danny, the redoubtable Danny, lay on his back. His body quivered as consciousness strove to return to it. He had not staggered and sunk down, nor had he gone over in a long slumping fall. The right hook of Rivera had dropped him in midair with the abruptness of death. The referee shoved Rivera back with one hand, and stood over the fallen gladiator counting the seconds. It is the custom of prize-fighting audiences to cheer a clean knock-down blow. But this audience did not cheer. The thing had been too unexpected. It watched the toll of the seconds in tense silence, and through this silence the voice of Roberts rose exultantly:    ""I told you he was a two-handed fighter!""    By the fifth second, Danny was rolling over on his face, and when seven was counted, he rested on one knee, ready to rise after the count of nine and before the count of ten. If his knee still touched the floor at ""ten,"" he was considered ""down,"" and also ""out."" The instant his knee left the floor, he was considered ""up,"" and in that instant it was Rivera's right to try and put him down again. Rivera took no chances. The moment that knee left the floor he would strike again. He circled around, but the referee circled in between, and Rivera knew that the seconds he counted were very slow. All Gringos were against him, even the referee.    At ""nine"" the referee gave Rivera a sharp thrust back. It was unfair, but it enabled Danny to rise, the smile back on his lips. Doubled partly over, with arms wrapped about face and abdomen, he cleverly stumbled into a clinch. By all the rules of the game the referee should have broken it, but he did not, and Danny clung on like a surf-battered barnacle and moment by moment recuperated. The last minute of the round was going fast. If he could live to the end, he would have a full minute in his corner to revive. And live to the end he did, smiling through all desperateness and extremity.    ""The smile that won't come off!"" somebody yelled, and the audience laughed loudly in its relief.    ""The kick that Greaser's got is something God-awful,"" Danny gasped in his corner to his adviser while his handlers worked frantically over him.    The second and third rounds were tame. Danny, a tricky and consummate ring general, stalled and blocked and held on, devoting himself to recovering from that dazing first-round blow. In the fourth round he was himself again. Jarred and shaken, nevertheless his good condition had enabled him to regain his vigor. But he tried no man-eating tactics. The Mexican had proved a tartar. Instead, he brought to bear his best fighting powers. In tricks and skill and experience he was the master, and though he could land nothing vital, he proceeded scientifically to chop and wear down his opponent. He landed three blows to Rivera's one, but they were punishing blows only, and not deadly. It was the sum of many of them that constituted deadliness. He was respectful of this two-handed dub with the amazing short-arm kicks in both his fists.    In defense, Rivera developed a disconcerting straight-left. Again and again, attack after attack he straight-lefted away from him with accumulated damage to Danny's mouth and nose. But Danny was protean. That was why he was the coming champion. He could change from style to style of fighting at will. He now devoted himself to infighting. In this he was particularly wicked, and it enabled him to avoid the other's straight-left. Here he set the house wild repeatedly, capping it with a marvelous lockbreak and lift of an inside upper-cut that raised the Mexican in the air and dropped him to the mat. Rivera rested on one knee, making the most of the count, and in the soul of him he knew the referee was counting short seconds on him.    Again, in the seventh, Danny achieved the diabolical inside uppercut. He succeeded only in staggering Rivera, but, in the ensuing moment of defenseless helplessness, he smashed him with another blow through the ropes. Rivera's body bounced on the heads of the newspaper men below, and they boosted him back to the edge of the platform outside the ropes. Here he rested on one knee, while the referee raced off the seconds. Inside the ropes, through which he must duck to enter the ring, Danny waited for him. Nor did the referee intervene or thrust Danny back.    The house was beside itself with delight.    ""Kill'm, Danny, kill'm!"" was the cry.    Scores of voices took it up until it was like a war-chant of wolves.    Danny did his best, but Rivera, at the count of eight, instead of nine, came unexpectedly through the ropes and safely into a clinch. Now the referee worked, tearing him away so that he could be hit, giving Danny every advantage that an unfair referee can give.    But Rivera lived, and the daze cleared from his brain. It was all of a piece. They were the hated Gringos and they were all unfair. And in the worst of it visions continued to flash and sparkle in his brain--long lines of railroad track that simmered across the desert; rurales and American constables, prisons and calabooses; tramps at water tanks--all the squalid and painful panorama of his odyssey after Rio Blanca and the strike. And, resplendent and glorious, he saw the great, red Revolution sweeping across his land. The guns were there before him. Every hated face was a gun. It was for the guns he fought. He was the guns. He was the Revolution. He fought for all Mexico.    The audience began to grow incensed with Rivera. Why didn't he take the licking that was appointed him? Of course he was going to be licked, but why should he be so obstinate about it? Very few were interested in him, and they were the certain, definite percentage of a gambling crowd that plays long shots. Believing Danny to be the winner, nevertheless the y had put their money on the Mexican at four to ten and one to three. More than a trifle was up on the point of how many rounds Rivera could last. Wild money had appeared at the ringside proclaiming that he could not last seven rounds, or even six. The winners of this, now that their cash risk was happily settled, had joined in cheering on the favorite.    Rivera refused to be licked. Through the eighth round his opponent strove vainly to repeat the uppercut. In the ninth, Rivera stunned the house again. In the midst of a clinch he broke the lock with a quick, lithe movement, and in the narrow space between their bodies his right lifted from the waist. Danny went to the floor and took the safety of the count. The crowd was appalled. He was being bested at his own game. His famous right-uppercut had been worked back on him. Rivera made no attempt to catch him as he arose at ""nine."" The referee was openly blocking that play, though he stood clear when the situation was reversed and it was Rivera who desired to rise.    Twice in the tenth, Rivera put through the right-uppercut, lifted from waist to opponent's chin. Danny grew desperate. The smile never left his face, but he went back to his man-eating rushes. Whirlwind as he would, be could not damage Rivera, while Rivera through the blur and whirl, dropped him to the mat three times in succession. Danny did not recuperate so quickly now, and by the eleventh round he was in a serious way. But from then till the fourteenth he put up the gamest exhibition of his career. He stalled and blocked, fought parsimoniously, and strove to gather strength. Also, he fought as foully as a successful fighter knows how. Every trick and device he employed, butting in the clinches with the seeming of accident, pinioning Rivera's glove between arm and body, heeling his glove on Rivera's mouth to clog his breathing. Often, in the clinches, through his cut and smiling lips he snarled insults unspeakable and vile in Rivera's ear. Everybody, from the referee to the house, was with Danny and was helping Danny. And they knew what he had in mind. Bested by this surprise-box of an unknown, he was pinning all on a single punch. He offered himself for punishment, fished, and feinted, and drew, for that one opening that would enable him to whip a blow through with all his strength and turn the tide. As another and greater fighter had done before him, he might do a right and left, to solar plexus and across the jaw. He could do it, for he was noted for the strength of punch that remained in his arms as long as he could keep his feet.    Rivera's seconds were not half-caring for him in the intervals between rounds. Their towels made a showing, but drove little air into his panting lungs. Spider Hagerty talked advice to him, but Rivera knew it was wrong advice. Everybody was against him. He was surrounded by treachery. In the fourteenth round he put Danny down again, and himself stood resting, hands dropped at side, while the referee counted. In the other corner Rivera had been noting suspicious whisperings. He saw Michael Kelly make his way to Roberts and bend and whisper. Rivera's ears were a cat's, desert-trained, and he caught snatches of what was said. He wanted to hear more, and when his opponent arose he maneuvered the fight into a clinch over against the ropes.    ""Got to,"" he could hear Michael, while Roberts nodded. ""Danny's got to win--I stand to lose a mint--I've got a ton of money covered--my own. If he lasts the fifteenth I'm bust--the boy'll mind you. Put something across.""    And thereafter Rivera saw no more visions. They were trying to job him. Once again he dropped Danny and stood resting, his hands at his slide. Roberts stood up.    ""That settled him,"" he said.    ""Go to your corner.""    He spoke with authority, as he had often spoken to Rivera at the training quarters. But Rivera looked hatred at him and waited for Danny to rise. Back in his corner in the minute interval, Kelly, the promoter, came and talked to Rivera.    ""Throw it, damn you,"" he rasped in, a harsh low voice. ""You gotta lay down, Rivera. Stick with me and I'll make your future. I'll let you lick Danny next time. But here's where you lay down.""    Rivera showed with his eyes that he heard, but he made neither sign of assent nor dissent.    ""Why don't you speak?"" Kelly demanded angrily.    ""You lose, anyway,"" Spider Hagerty supplemented. ""The referee'll take it away from you. Listen to Kelly, and lay down.""    ""Lay down, kid,"" Kelly pleaded, ""and I'll help you to the championship.""    Rivera did not answer.    ""I will, so help me, kid.""    At the strike of the gong Rivera sensed something impending. The house did not. Whatever it was it was there inside the ring with him and very close. Danny's earlier surety seemed returned to him. The confidence of his advance frightened Rivera. Some trick was about to be worked. Danny rushed, but Rivera refused the encounter. He side-stepped away into safety. What the other wanted was a clinch. It was in some way necessary to the trick. Rivera backed and circled away, yet he knew, sooner or later, the clinch and the trick would come. Desperately he resolved to draw it. He made as if to effect the clinch with Danny's next rush. Instead, at the last instant, just as their bodies should have come together, Rivera darted nimbly back. And in the same instant Danny's corner raised a cry of foul. Rivera had fooled them. The referee paused irresolutely. The decision that trembled on his lips was never uttered, for a shrill, boy's voice from the gallery piped, ""Raw work!""    Danny cursed Rivera openly, and forced him, while Rivera danced away. Also, Rivera made up his mind to strike no more blows at the body. In this he threw away half his chance of winning, but he knew if he was to win at all it was with the outfighting that remained to him. Given the least opportunity, they would lie a foul on him. Danny threw all caution to the winds. For two rounds he tore after and into the boy who dared not meet him at close quarters. Rivera was struck again and again; he took blows by the dozens to avoid the perilous clinch. During this supreme final rally of Danny's the audience rose to its feet and went mad. It did not understand. All it could see was that its favorite was winning, after all.    ""Why don't you fight?"" it demanded wrathfully of Rivera.    ""You're yellow! You're yellow!"" ""Open up, you cur! Open up!"" ""Kill'm, Danny! Kill 'm!"" ""You sure got 'm! Kill 'm!""    In all the house, bar none, Rivera was the only cold man. By temperament and blood he was the hottest-passioned there; but he had gone through such vastly greater heats that this collective passion of ten thousand throats, rising surge on surge, was to his brain no more than the velvet cool of a summer twilight.    Into the seventeenth round Danny carried his rally. Rivera, under a heavy blow, drooped and sagged. His hands dropped helplessly as he reeled backward. Danny thought it was his chance. The boy was at, his mercy. Thus Rivera, feigning, caught him off his guard, lashing out a clean drive to the mouth. Danny went down. When he arose, Rivera felled him with a down-chop of the right on neck and jaw. Three times he repeated this. It was impossible for any referee to call these blows foul.    ""Oh, Bill! Bill!"" Kelly pleaded to the referee.    ""I can't,"" that official lamented back. ""He won't give me a chance.""    Danny, battered and heroic, still kept coming up. Kelly and others near to the ring began to cry out to the police to stop it, though Danny's corner refused to throw in the towel. Rivera saw the fat police captain starting awkwardly to climb through the ropes, and was not sure what it meant. There were so many ways of cheating in this game of the Gringos. Danny, on his feet, tottered groggily and helplessly before him. The referee and the captain were both reaching for Rivera when he struck the last blow. There was no need to stop the fight, for Danny did not rise.    ""Count!"" Rivera cried hoarsely to the referee.    And when the count was finished, Danny's seconds gathered him up and carried him to his corner.    ""Who wins?"" Rivera demanded.    Reluctantly, the referee caught his gloved hand and held it aloft.    There were no congratulations for Rivera. He walked to his corner unattended, where his seconds had not yet placed his stool. He leaned backward on the ropes and looked his hatred at them, swept it on and about him till the whole ten thousand Gringos were included. His knees trembled under him, and he was sobbing from exhaustion. Before his eyes the hated faces swayed back and forth in the giddiness of nausea. Then he remembered they were the guns. The guns were his. The Revolution could go on.                             <br><br>"
42,The Story of Keesh,"KEESH lived long ago on the rim of the polar sea, was head man of   his village through many and prosperous years, and died full of   honors with his name on the lips of men.  So long ago did he live   that only the old men remember his name, his name and the tale,   which they got from the old men before them, and which the old men   to come will tell to their children and their children's children   down to the end of time.  And the winter darkness, when the north   gales make their long sweep across the ice-pack, and the air is   filled with flying white, and no man may venture forth, is the   chosen time for the telling of how Keesh, from the poorest IGLOO in   the village, rose to power and place over them all.      <br><br>He was a bright boy, so the tale runs, healthy and strong, and he   had seen thirteen suns, in their way of reckoning time.  For each   winter the sun leaves the land in darkness, and the next year a new   sun returns so that they may be warm again and look upon one   another's faces.  The father of Keesh had been a very brave man,   but he had met his death in a time of famine, when he sought to   save the lives of his people by taking the life of a great polar   bear.  In his eagerness he came to close grapples with the bear,   and his bones were crushed; but the bear had much meat on him and   the people were saved.  Keesh was his only son, and after that   Keesh lived alone with his mother.  But the people are prone to   forget, and they forgot the deed of his father; and he being but a   boy, and his mother only a woman, they, too, were swiftly   forgotten, and ere long came to live in the meanest of all the   IGLOOS.    <br><br>It was at a council, one night, in the big IGLOO of Klosh-Kwan, the   chief, that Keesh showed the blood that ran in his veins and the   manhood that stiffened his back.  With the dignity of an elder, he   rose to his feet, and waited for silence amid the babble of voices.      <br><br>""It is true that meat be apportioned me and mine,"" he said.  ""But   it is ofttimes old and tough, this meat, and, moreover, it has an   unusual quantity of bones.""    <br><br>The hunters, grizzled and gray, and lusty and young, were aghast.    The like had never been known before.  A child, that talked like a   grown man, and said harsh things to their very faces!      <br><br>But steadily and with seriousness, Keesh went on.  ""For that I know   my father, Bok, was a great hunter, I speak these words.  It is   said that Bok brought home more meat than any of the two best   hunters, that with his own hands he attended to the division of it,   that with his own eyes he saw to it that the least old woman and   the last old man received fair share.""    <br><br>""Na! Na!"" the men cried.  ""Put the child out!""  ""Send him off to   bed!""  ""He is no man that he should talk to men and graybeards!""      <br><br>He waited calmly till the uproar died down.    <br><br>""Thou hast a wife, Ugh-Gluk,"" he said, ""and for her dost thou   speak.  And thou, too, Massuk, a mother also, and for them dost   thou speak.  My mother has no one, save me; wherefore I speak.  As   I say, though Bok be dead because he hunted over-keenly, it is just   that I, who am his son, and that Ikeega, who is my mother and was   his wife, should have meat in plenty so long as there be meat in   plenty in the tribe.  I, Keesh, the son of Bok, have spoken.""      <br><br>He sat down, his ears keenly alert to the flood of protest and   indignation his words had created.    <br><br>""That a boy should speak in council!"" old Ugh-Gluk was mumbling.      <br><br>""Shall the babes in arms tell us men the things we shall do?""   Massuk demanded in a loud voice.  ""Am I a man that I should be made   a mock by every child that cries for meat?""    <br><br>The anger boiled a white heat.  They ordered him to bed, threatened   that he should have no meat at all, and promised him sore beatings   for his presumption.  Keesh's eyes began to flash, and the blood to   pound darkly under his skin.  In the midst of the abuse he sprang   to his feet.      <br><br>""Hear me, ye men!"" he cried.  ""Never shall I speak in the council   again, never again till the men come to me and say, 'It is well,   Keesh, that thou shouldst speak, it is well and it is our wish.'    Take this now, ye men, for my last word.  Bok, my father, was a   great hunter.  I, too, his son, shall go and hunt the meat that I   eat.  And be it known, now, that the division of that which I kill   shall be fair.  And no widow nor weak one shall cry in the night   because there is no meat, when the strong men are groaning in great   pain for that they have eaten overmuch.  And in the days to come   there shall be shame upon the strong men who have eaten overmuch.    I, Keesh, have said it!""    <br><br>Jeers and scornful laughter followed him out of the IGLOO, but his   jaw was set and he went his way, looking neither to right nor left.      <br><br>The next day he went forth along the shore-line where the ice and   the land met together.  Those who saw him go noted that he carried   his bow, with a goodly supply of bone-barbed arrows, and that   across his shoulder was his father's big hunting-spear.  And there   was laughter, and much talk, at the event.  It was an unprecedented   occurrence.  Never did boys of his tender age go forth to hunt,   much less to hunt alone.  Also were there shaking of heads and   prophetic mutterings, and the women looked pityingly at Ikeega, and   her face was grave and sad.    <br><br>""He will be back ere long,"" they said cheeringly.      <br><br>""Let him go; it will teach him a lesson,"" the hunters said.  ""And   he will come back shortly, and he will be meek and soft of speech   in the days to follow.""    <br><br>But a day passed, and a second, and on the third a wild gale blew,   and there was no Keesh.  Ikeega tore her hair and put soot of the   seal-oil on her face in token of her grief; and the women assailed   the men with bitter words in that they had mistreated the boy and   sent him to his death; and the men made no answer, preparing to go   in search of the body when the storm abated.      <br><br>Early next morning, however, Keesh strode into the village.  But he   came not shamefacedly.  Across his shoulders he bore a burden of   fresh-killed meat.  And there was importance in his step and   arrogance in his speech.    <br><br>""Go, ye men, with the dogs and sledges, and take my trail for the   better part of a day's travel,"" he said.  ""There is much meat on   the ice - a she-bear and two half-grown cubs.""      <br><br>Ikeega was overcome with joy, but he received her demonstrations in   manlike fashion, saying:  ""Come, Ikeega, let us eat.  And after   that I shall sleep, for I am weary.""    <br><br>And he passed into their IGLOO and ate profoundly, and after that   slept for twenty running hours.      <br><br>There was much doubt at first, much doubt and discussion.  The   killing of a polar bear is very dangerous, but thrice dangerous is   it, and three times thrice, to kill a mother bear with her cubs.    The men could not bring themselves to believe that the boy Keesh,   single-handed, had accomplished so great a marvel.  But the women   spoke of the fresh-killed meat he had brought on his back, and this   was an overwhelming argument against their unbelief.  So they   finally departed, grumbling greatly that in all probability, if the   thing were so, he had neglected to cut up the carcasses.  Now in   the north it is very necessary that this should be done as soon as   a kill is made.  If not, the meat freezes so solidly as to turn the   edge of the sharpest knife, and a three-hundred-pound bear, frozen   stiff, is no easy thing to put upon a sled and haul over the rough   ice.  But arrived at the spot, they found not only the kill, which   they had doubted, but that Keesh had quartered the beasts in true   hunter fashion, and removed the entrails.    <br><br>Thus began the mystery of Keesh, a mystery that deepened and   deepened with the passing of the days.  His very next trip he   killed a young bear, nearly full-grown, and on the trip following,   a large male bear and his mate.  He was ordinarily gone from three   to four days, though it was nothing unusual for him to stay away a   week at a time on the ice-field.  Always he declined company on   these expeditions, and the people marvelled.  ""How does he do it?""   they demanded of one another.  ""Never does he take a dog with him,   and dogs are of such great help, too.""      <br><br>""Why dost thou hunt only bear?"" Klosh-Kwan once ventured to ask   him.    <br><br>And Keesh made fitting answer.  ""It is well known that there is   more meat on the bear,"" he said.      <br><br>But there was also talk of witchcraft in the village.  ""He hunts   with evil spirits,"" some of the people contended, ""wherefore his   hunting is rewarded.  How else can it be, save that he hunts with   evil spirits?""    <br><br>""Mayhap they be not evil, but good, these spirits,"" others said.    ""It is known that his father was a mighty hunter.  May not his   father hunt with him so that he may attain excellence and patience   and understanding?  Who knows?""      <br><br>None the less, his success continued, and the less skilful hunters   were often kept busy hauling in his meat.  And in the division of   it he was just.  As his father had done before him, he saw to it   that the least old woman and the last old man received a fair   portion, keeping no more for himself than his needs required.  And   because of this, and of his merit as a hunter, he was looked upon   with respect, and even awe; and there was talk of making him chief   after old Klosh-Kwan.  Because of the things he had done, they   looked for him to appear again in the council, but he never came,   and they were ashamed to ask.    <br><br>""I am minded to build me an IGLOO,"" he said one day to Klosh-Kwan   and a number of the hunters.  ""It shall be a large IGLOO, wherein   Ikeega and I can dwell in comfort.""      <br><br>""Ay,"" they nodded gravely.    <br><br>""But I have no time.  My business is hunting, and it takes all my   time.  So it is but just that the men and women of the village who   eat my meat should build me my IGLOO.""      <br><br>And the IGLOO was built accordingly, on a generous scale which   exceeded even the dwelling of Klosh-Kwan.  Keesh and his mother   moved into it, and it was the first prosperity she had enjoyed   since the death of Bok.  Nor was material prosperity alone hers,   for, because of her wonderful son and the position he had given   her, she came to he looked upon as the first woman in all the   village; and the women were given to visiting her, to asking her   advice, and to quoting her wisdom when arguments arose among   themselves or with the men.    <br><br>But it was the mystery of Keesh's marvellous hunting that took   chief place in all their minds.  And one day Ugh-Gluk taxed him   with witchcraft to his face.      <br><br>""It is charged,"" Ugh-Gluk said ominously, ""that thou dealest with   evil spirits, wherefore thy hunting is rewarded.""    <br><br>""Is not the meat good?"" Keesh made answer.  ""Has one in the village   yet to fall sick from the eating of it?  How dost thou know that   witchcraft be concerned?  Or dost thou guess, in the dark, merely   because of the envy that consumes thee?""      <br><br>And Ugh-Gluk withdrew discomfited, the women laughing at him as he   walked away.  But in the council one night, after long   deliberation, it was determined to put spies on his track when he   went forth to hunt, so that his methods might be learned.  So, on   his next trip, Bim and Bawn, two young men, and of hunters the   craftiest, followed after him, taking care not to be seen.  After   five days they returned, their eyes bulging and their tongues a-  tremble to tell what they had seen.  The council was hastily called   in Klosh-Kwan's dwelling, and Bim took up the tale.    <br><br>""Brothers!  As commanded, we journeyed on the trail of Keesh, and   cunningly we journeyed, so that he might not know.  And midway of   the first day he picked up with a great he-bear.  It was a very   great bear.""      <br><br>""None greater,"" Bawn corroborated, and went on himself.  ""Yet was   the bear not inclined to fight, for he turned away and made off   slowly over the ice.  This we saw from the rocks of the shore, and   the bear came toward us, and after him came Keesh, very much   unafraid.  And he shouted harsh words after the bear, and waved his   arms about, and made much noise.  Then did the bear grow angry, and   rise up on his hind legs, and growl.  But Keesh walked right up to   the bear.""    <br><br>""Ay,"" Bim continued the story.  ""Right up to the bear Keesh walked.    And the bear took after him, and Keesh ran away.  But as he ran he   dropped a little round ball on the ice.  And the bear stopped and   smelled of it, then swallowed it up.  And Keesh continued to run   away and drop little round balls, and the bear continued to swallow   them up.""      <br><br>Exclamations and cries of doubt were being made, and Ugh-Gluk   expressed open unbelief.    <br><br>""With our own eyes we saw it,"" Bim affirmed.      <br><br>And Bawn - ""Ay, with our own eyes.  And this continued until the   bear stood suddenly upright and cried aloud in pain, and thrashed   his fore paws madly about.  And Keesh continued to make off over   the ice to a safe distance.  But the bear gave him no notice, being   occupied with the misfortune the little round balls had wrought   within him.""    <br><br>""Ay, within him,"" Bim interrupted.  ""For he did claw at himself,   and leap about over the ice like a playful puppy, save from the way   he growled and squealed it was plain it was not play but pain.    Never did I see such a sight!""      <br><br>""Nay, never was such a sight seen,"" Bawn took up the strain.  ""And   furthermore, it was such a large bear.""    <br><br>""Witchcraft,"" Ugh-Gluk suggested.      <br><br>""I know not,"" Bawn replied.  ""I tell only of what my eyes beheld.    And after a while the bear grew weak and tired, for he was very   heavy and he had jumped about with exceeding violence, and he went   off along the shore-ice, shaking his head slowly from side to side   and sitting down ever and again to squeal and cry.  And Keesh   followed after the bear, and we followed after Keesh, and for that   day and three days more we followed.  The bear grew weak, and never   ceased crying from his pain.""    <br><br>""It was a charm!"" Ugh-Gluk exclaimed.  ""Surely it was a charm!""      <br><br>""It may well be.""    <br><br>And Bim relieved Bawn.  ""The bear wandered, now this way and now   that, doubling back and forth and crossing his trail in circles, so   that at the end he was near where Keesh had first come upon him.    By this time he was quite sick, the bear, and could crawl no   farther, so Keesh came up close and speared him to death.""      <br><br>""And then?"" Klosh-Kwan demanded.    <br><br>""Then we left Keesh skinning the bear, and came running that the   news of the killing might be told.""      <br><br>And in the afternoon of that day the women hauled in the meat of   the bear while the men sat in council assembled.  When Keesh   arrived a messenger was sent to him, bidding him come to the   council.  But he sent reply, saying that he was hungry and tired;   also that his IGLOO was large and comfortable and could hold many   men.    <br><br>And curiosity was so strong on the men that the whole council,   Klosh-Kwan to the fore, rose up and went to the IGLOO of Keesh.  He   was eating, but he received them with respect and seated them   according to their rank.  Ikeega was proud and embarrassed by   turns, but Keesh was quite composed.      <br><br>Klosh-Kwan recited the information brought by Bim and Bawn, and at   its close said in a stern voice:  ""So explanation is wanted, O   Keesh, of thy manner of hunting.  Is there witchcraft in it?""    <br><br>Keesh looked up and smiled.  ""Nay, O Klosh-Kwan.  It is not for a   boy to know aught of witches, and of witches I know nothing.  I   have but devised a means whereby I may kill the ice-bear with ease,   that is all.  It be headcraft, not witchcraft.""      <br><br>""And may any man?""    <br><br>""Any man.""      <br><br>There was a long silence.  The men looked in one another's faces,   and Keesh went on eating.    <br><br>""And . . . and . . . and wilt thou tell us, O Keesh?"" Klosh-Kwan   finally asked in a tremulous voice.      <br><br>""Yea, I will tell thee.""  Keesh finished sucking a marrow-bone and   rose to his feet.  ""It is quite simple.  Behold!""    <br><br>He picked up a thin strip of whalebone and showed it to them.  The   ends were sharp as needle-points.  The strip he coiled carefully,   till it disappeared in his hand.  Then, suddenly releasing it, it   sprang straight again.  He picked up a piece of blubber.      <br><br>""So,"" he said, ""one takes a small chunk of blubber, thus, and thus   makes it hollow.  Then into the hollow goes the whalebone, so,   tightly coiled, and another piece of blubber is fitted over the   whale-bone.  After that it is put outside where it freezes into a   little round ball.  The bear swallows the little round ball, the   blubber melts, the whalebone with its sharp ends stands out   straight, the bear gets sick, and when the bear is very sick, why,   you kill him with a spear.  It is quite simple.""    <br><br>And Ugh-Gluk said ""Oh!"" and Klosh-Kwan said ""Ah!""  And each said   something after his own manner, and all understood.      <br><br>And this is the story of Keesh, who lived long ago on the rim of   the polar sea.  Because he exercised headcraft and not witchcraft,   he rose from the meanest IGLOO to be head man of his village, and   through all the years that he lived, it is related, his tribe was   prosperous, and neither widow nor weak one cried aloud in the night   because there was no meat.                             <br><br>"
43,The White Silence,"'Carmen won't last more than a couple of days.' Mason spat out a chunk of ice and surveyed the poor animal ruefully, then put her foot in his mouth and proceeded to bite out the ice which clustered cruelly between the toes.   <br><br>'I never saw a dog with a highfalutin' name that ever was worth a rap,' he said, as he concluded his task and shoved her aside. 'They just fade away and die under the responsibility. Did ye ever see one go wrong with a sensible name like Cassiar, Siwash, or Husky? No, sir! Take a look at Shookum here, he's--' Snap! The lean brute flashed up, the white teeth just missing Mason's throat.  <br><br>'Ye will, will ye?' A shrewd clout behind the ear with the butt of the dog whip stretched the animal in the snow, quivering softly, a yellow slaver dripping from its fangs.   <br><br>'As I was saying, just look at Shookum here--he's got the spirit. Bet ye he eats Carmen before the week's out.' 'I'll bank another proposition against that,' replied Malemute Kid, reversing the frozen bread placed before the fire to thaw. 'We'll eat Shookum before the trip is over. What d'ye say, Ruth?' The Indian woman settled the coffee with a piece of ice, glanced from Malemute Kid to her husband, then at the dogs, but vouchsafed no reply. It was such a palpable truism that none was necessary. Two hundred miles of unbroken trail in prospect, with a scant six days' grub for themselves and none for the dogs, could admit no other alternative. The two men and the woman grouped about the fire and began their meager meal. The dogs lay in their harnesses for it was a midday halt, and watched each mouthful enviously.  <br><br>'No more lunches after today,' said Malemute Kid. 'And we've got to keep a close eye on the dogs--they're getting vicious. They'd just as soon pull a fellow down as not, if they get a chance.' 'And I was president of an Epworth once, and taught in the Sunday school.' Having irrelevantly delivered himself of this, Mason fell into a dreamy contemplation of his steaming moccasins, but was aroused by Ruth filling his cup.   <br><br>'Thank God, we've got slathers of tea! I've seen it growing, down in Tennessee. What wouldn't I give for a hot corn pone just now! Never mind, Ruth; you won't starve much longer, nor wear moccasins either.' The woman threw off her gloom at this, and in her eyes welled up a great love for her white lord--the first white man she had ever seen--the first man whom she had known to treat a woman as something better than a mere animal or beast of burden.  <br><br>'Yes, Ruth,' continued her husband, having recourse to the macaronic jargon in which it was alone possible for them to understand each other; 'wait till we clean up and pull for the Outside. We'll take the White Man's canoe and go to the Salt Water. Yes, bad water, rough water--great mountains dance up and down all the time. And so big, so far, so far away--you travel ten sleep, twenty sleep, forty sleep'--he graphically enumerated the days on his fingers--'all the time water, bad water. Then you come to great village, plenty people, just the same mosquitoes next summer. Wigwams oh, so high--ten, twenty pines.   <br><br>Hi-yu skookum!' He paused impotently, cast an appealing glance at Malemute Kid, then laboriously placed the twenty pines, end on end, by sign language. Malemute Kid smiled with cheery cynicism; but Ruth's eyes were wide with wonder, and with pleasure; for she half believed he was joking, and such condescension pleased her poor woman's heart.  <br><br>'And then you step into a--a box, and pouf! up you go.' He tossed his empty cup in the air by way of illustration and, as he deftly caught it, cried: 'And biff! down you come. Oh, great medicine men! You go Fort Yukon. I go Arctic City--twenty-five sleep--big string, all the time--I catch him string--I say, ""Hello, Ruth! How are ye?""--and you say, ""Is that my good husband?""--and I say, ""Yes""--and you say, ""No can bake good bread, no more soda""--then I say, ""Look in cache, under flour; good-by."" You look and catch plenty soda. All the time you Fort Yukon, me Arctic City. Hi-yu medicine man!' Ruth smiled so ingenuously at the fairy story that both men burst into laughter. A row among the dogs cut short the wonders of the Outside, and by the time the snarling combatants were separated, she had lashed the sleds and all was ready for the trail.-- 'Mush! Baldy! Hi! Mush on!' Mason worked his whip smartly and, as the dogs whined low in the traces, broke out the sled with the gee pole. Ruth followed with the second team, leaving Malemute Kid, who had helped her start, to bring up the rear. Strong man, brute that he was, capable of felling an ox at a blow, he could not bear to beat the poor animals, but humored them as a dog driver rarely does--nay, almost wept with them in their misery.   <br><br>'Come, mush on there, you poor sore-footed brutes!' he murmured, after several ineffectual attempts to start the load. But his patience was at last rewarded, and though whimpering with pain, they hastened to join their fellows.  <br><br>No more conversation; the toil of the trail will not permit such extravagance.   <br><br>And of all deadening labors, that of the Northland trail is the worst. Happy is the man who can weather a day's travel at the price of silence, and that on a beaten track.  And of all heartbreaking labors, that of breaking trail is the worst. At every step the great webbed shoe sinks till the snow is level with the knee. Then up, straight up, the deviation of a fraction of an inch being a certain precursor of disaster, the snowshoe must be lifted till the surface is cleared; then forward, down, and the other foot is raised perpendicularly for the matter of half a yard. He who tries this for the first time, if haply he avoids bringing his shoes in dangerous propinquity and measures not his length on the treacherous footing, will give up exhausted at the end of a hundred yards; he who can keep out of the way of the dogs for a whole day may well crawl into his sleeping bag with a clear conscience and a pride which passeth all understanding; and he who travels twenty sleeps on the Long Trail is a man whom the gods may envy.  <br><br>The afternoon wore on, and with the awe, born of the White Silence, the voiceless travelers bent to their work. Nature has many tricks wherewith she convinces man of his finity--the ceaseless flow of the tides, the fury of the storm, the shock of the earthquake, the long roll of heaven's artillery--but the most tremendous, the most stupefying of all, is the passive phase of the White Silence. All movement ceases, the sky clears, the heavens are as brass; the slightest whisper seems sacrilege, and man becomes timid, affrighted at the sound of his own voice. Sole speck of life journeying across the ghostly wastes of a dead world, he trembles at his audacity, realizes that his is a maggot's life, nothing more.   <br><br>Strange thoughts arise unsummoned, and the mystery of all things strives for utterance.  <br><br>And the fear of death, of God, of the universe, comes over him--the hope of the Resurrection and the Life, the yearning for immortality, the vain striving of the imprisoned essence--it is then, if ever, man walks alone with God.   <br><br>So wore the day away. The river took a great bend, and Mason headed his team for the cutoff across the narrow neck of land. But the dogs balked at the high bank. Again and again, though Ruth and Malemute Kid were shoving on the sled, they slipped back. Then came the concerted effort. The miserable creatures, weak from hunger, exerted their last strength. Up--up--the sled poised on the top of the bank; but the leader swung the string of dogs behind him to the right, fouling Mason's snowshoes. The result was grievous.  <br><br>Mason was whipped off his feet; one of the dogs fell in the traces; and the sled toppled back, dragging everything to the bottom again.   <br><br>Slash! the whip fell among the dogs savagely, especially upon the one which had fallen.  <br><br>'Don't,--Mason,' entreated Malemute Kid; 'the poor devil's on its last legs.  Wait and we'll put my team on.' Mason deliberately withheld the whip till the last word had fallen, then out flashed the long lash, completely curling about the offending creature's body.   <br><br>Carmen--for it was Carmen--cowered in the snow, cried piteously, then rolled over on her side.  <br><br>It was a tragic moment, a pitiful incident of the trail--a dying dog, two comrades in anger.   <br><br>Ruth glanced solicitously from man to man. But Malemute Kid restrained himself, though there was a world of reproach in his eyes, and, bending over the dog, cut the traces. No word was spoken. The teams were doublespanned and the difficulty overcome; the sleds were under way again, the dying dog dragging herself along in the rear. As long as an animal can travel, it is not shot, and this last chance is accorded it--the crawling into camp, if it can, in the hope of a moose being killed.  <br><br>Already penitent for his angry action, but too stubborn to make amends, Mason toiled on at the head of the cavalcade, little dreaming that danger hovered in the air. The timber clustered thick in the sheltered bottom, and through this they threaded their way. Fifty feet or more from the trail towered a lofty pine. For generations it had stood there, and for generations destiny had had this one end in view--perhaps the same had been decreed of Mason.   <br><br>He stooped to fasten the loosened thong of his moccasin. The sleds came to a halt, and the dogs lay down in the snow without a whimper. The stillness was weird; not a breath rustled the frost-encrusted forest; the cold and silence of outer space had chilled the heart and smote the trembling lips of nature. A sigh pulsed through the air--they did not seem to actually hear it, but rather felt it, like the premonition of movement in a motionless void. Then the great tree, burdened with its weight of years and snow, played its last part in the tragedy of life. He heard the warning crash and attempted to spring up but, almost erect, caught the blow squarely on the shoulder.  <br><br>The sudden danger, the quick death--how often had Malemute Kid faced it! The pine needles were still quivering as he gave his commands and sprang into action. Nor did the Indian girl faint or raise her voice in idle wailing, as might many of her white sisters. At his order, she threw her weight on the end of a quickly extemporized handspike, easing the pressure and listening to her husband's groans, while Malemute Kid attacked the tree with his ax. The steel rang merrily as it bit into the frozen trunk, each stroke being accompanied by a forced, audible respiration, the 'Huh!' 'Huh!' of the woodsman.   <br><br>At last the Kid laid the pitiable thing that was once a man in the snow. But worse than his comrade's pain was the dumb anguish in the woman's face, the blended look of hopeful, hopeless query. Little was said; those of the Northland are early taught the futility of words and the inestimable value of deeds. With the temperature at sixty-five below zero, a man cannot lie many minutes in the snow and live. So the sled lashings were cut, and the sufferer, rolled in furs, laid on a couch of boughs. Before him roared a fire, built of the very wood which wrought the mishap. Behind and partially over him was stretched the primitive fly--a piece of canvas, which caught the radiating heat and threw it back and down upon hima trick which men may know who study physics at the fount.  <br><br>And men who have shared their bed with death know when the call is sounded. Mason was terribly crushed. The most cursory examination revealed it.   <br><br>His right arm, leg, and back were broken; his limbs were paralyzed from the hips; and the likelihood of internal injuries was large. An occasional moan was his only sign of life.  <br><br>No hope; nothing to be done. The pitiless night crept slowly by--Ruth's portion, the despairing stoicism of her race, and Malemute Kid adding new lines to his face of bronze.   <br><br>In fact, Mason suffered least of all, for he spent his time in eastern Tennessee, in the Great Smoky Mountains, living over the scenes of his childhood. And most pathetic was the melody of his long-forgotten Southern vernacular, as he raved of swimming holes and coon hunts and watermelon raids. It was as Greek to Ruth, but the Kid understood and felt--felt as only one can feel who has been shut out for years from all that civilization means.  <br><br>Morning brought consciousness to the stricken man, and Malemute Kid bent closer to catch his whispers.   <br><br>'You remember when we foregathered on the Tanana, four years come next ice run? I didn't care so much for her then. It was more like she was pretty, and there was a smack of excitement about it, I think. But d'ye know, I've come to think a heap of her. She's been a good wife to me, always at my shoulder in the pinch. And when it comes to trading, you know there isn't her equal. D'ye recollect the time she shot the Moosehorn Rapids to pull you and me off that rock, the bullets whipping the water like hailstones?- and the time of the famine at Nuklukyeto?--when she raced the ice run to bring the news?  <br><br>Yes, she's been a good wife to me, better'n that other one. Didn't know I'd been there?   <br><br>Never told you, eh? Well, I tried it once, down in the States. That's why I'm here. Been raised together, too. I came away to give her a chance for divorce. She got it.  <br><br>'But that's got nothing to do with Ruth. I had thought of cleaning up and pulling for the Outside next year--her and I--but it's too late. Don't send her back to her people, Kid. It's beastly hard for a woman to go back. Think of it!--nearly four years on our bacon and beans and flour and dried fruit, and then to go back to her fish and caribou. It's not good for her to have tried our ways, to come to know they're better'n her people's, and then return to them. Take care of her, Kidwhy don't you--but no, you always fought shy of them--and you never told me why you came to this country. Be kind to her, and send her back to the States as soon as you can. But fix it so she can come back--liable to get homesick, you know.   <br><br>'And the youngster--it's drawn us closer, Kid. I only hope it is a boy. Think of it!--flesh of my flesh, Kid. He mustn't stop in this country. And if it's a girl, why, she can't. Sell my furs; they'll fetch at least five thousand, and I've got as much more with the company. And handle my interests with yours. I think that bench claim will show up. See that he gets a good schooling; and Kid, above all, don't let him come back. This country was not made for white men.  <br><br>'I'm a gone man, Kid. Three or four sleeps at the best. You've got to go on.  You must go on! Remember, it's my wife, it's my boy--O God! I hope it's a boy! You can't stay by me--and I charge you, a dying man, to pull on.'   <br><br>'Give me three days,' pleaded Malemute Kid. 'You may change for the better; something may turn up.'  <br><br>'No.'   <br><br>'Just three days.'  <br><br>'You must pull on.'   <br><br>'Two days.'  <br><br>'It's my wife and my boy, Kid. You would not ask it.'   <br><br>'One day.'  <br><br>'No, no! I charge-'   <br><br>'Only one day. We can shave it through on the grub, and I might knock over a moose.'  <br><br>'No--all right; one day, but not a minute more. And, Kid, don't--don't leave me to face it alone. Just a shot, one pull on the trigger. You understand. Think of it! Think of it! Flesh of my flesh, and I'll never live to see him!   <br><br>'Send Ruth here. I want to say good-by and tell her that she must think of the boy and not wait till I'm dead. She might refuse to go with you if I didn't. Goodby, old man; good-by.  <br><br>'Kid! I say--a--sink a hole above the pup, next to the slide. I panned out forty cents on my shovel there.   <br><br>'And, Kid!' He stooped lower to catch the last faint words, the dying man's surrender of his pride. 'I'm sorry--for--you know--Carmen.' Leaving the girl crying softly over her man, Malemute Kid slipped into his parka and snowshoes, tucked his rifle under his arm, and crept away into the forest. He was no tyro in the stern sorrows of the Northland, but never had he faced so stiff a problem as this. In the abstract, it was a plain, mathematical propositionthree possible lives as against one doomed one. But now he hesitated. For five years, shoulder to shoulder, on the rivers and trails, in the camps and mines, facing death by field and flood and famine, had they knitted the bonds of their comradeship. So close was the tie that he had often been conscious of a vague jealousy of Ruth, from the first time she had come between. And now it must be severed by his own hand.  <br><br>Though he prayed for a moose, just one moose, all game seemed to have deserted the land, and nightfall found the exhausted man crawling into camp, lighthanded, heavyhearted. An uproar from the dogs and shrill cries from Ruth hastened him.   <br><br>Bursting into the camp, he saw the girl in the midst of the snarling pack, laying about her with an ax. The dogs had broken the iron rule of their masters and were rushing the grub.  <br><br>He joined the issue with his rifle reversed, and the hoary game of natural selection was played out with all the ruthlessness of its primeval environment. Rifle and ax went up and down, hit or missed with monotonous regularity; lithe bodies flashed, with wild eyes and dripping fangs; and man and beast fought for supremacy to the bitterest conclusion. Then the beaten brutes crept to the edge of the firelight, licking their wounds, voicing their misery to the stars.   <br><br>The whole stock of dried salmon had been devoured, and perhaps five pounds of flour remained to tide them over two hundred miles of wilderness. Ruth returned to her husband, while Malemute Kid cut up the warm body of one of the dogs, the skull of which had been crushed by the ax. Every portion was carefully put away, save the hide and offal, which were cast to his fellows of the moment before.  <br><br>Morning brought fresh trouble. The animals were turning on each other. Carmen, who still clung to her slender thread of life, was downed by the pack. The lash fell among them unheeded. They cringed and cried under the blows, but refused to scatter till the last wretched bit had disappeared--bones, hide, hair, everything.   <br><br>Malemute Kid went about his work, listening to Mason, who was back in Tennessee, delivering tangled discourses and wild exhortations to his brethren of other days.  <br><br>Taking advantage of neighboring pines, he worked rapidly, and Ruth watched him make a cache similar to those sometimes used by hunters to preserve their meat from the wolverines and dogs. One after the other, he bent the tops of two small pines toward each other and nearly to the ground, making them fast with thongs of moosehide. Then he beat the dogs into submission and harnessed them to two of the sleds, loading the same with everything but the furs which enveloped Mason. These he wrapped and lashed tightly about him, fastening either end of the robes to the bent pines. A single stroke of his hunting knife would release them and send the body high in the air.   <br><br>Ruth had received her husband's last wishes and made no struggle. Poor girl, she had learned the lesson of obedience well. From a child, she had bowed, and seen all women bow, to the lords of creation, and it did not seem in the nature of things for woman to resist. The Kid permitted her one outburst of grief, as she kissed her husband--her own people had no such custom--then led her to the foremost sled and helped her into her snowshoes. Blindly, instinctively, she took the gee pole and whip, and 'mushed' the dogs out on the trail. Then he returned to Mason, who had fallen into a coma, and long after she was out of sight crouched by the fire, waiting, hoping, praying for his comrade to die.  <br><br>It is not pleasant to be alone with painful thoughts in the White Silence. The silence of gloom is merciful, shrouding one as with protection and breathing a thousand intangible sympathies; but the bright White Silence, clear and cold, under steely skies, is pitiless.   <br><br>An hour passed--two hours--but the man would not die. At high noon the sun, without raising its rim above the southern horizon, threw a suggestion of fire athwart the heavens, then quickly drew it back. Malemute Kid roused and dragged himself to his comrade's side. He cast one glance about him. The White Silence seemed to sneer, and a great fear came upon him. There was a sharp report; Mason swung into his aerial sepulcher, and Malemute Kid lashed the dogs into a wild gallop as he fled across the snow.                                    <br><br>"
44,The Wife of a King,"Once when the northland was very young, the social and civic virtues were remarkably alike for their paucity and their simplicity. When the burden of domestic duties grew grievous, and the fireside mood expanded to a constant protest against its bleak loneliness, the adventurers from the Southland, in lieu of better, paid the stipulated prices and took unto themselves native wives. It was a foretaste of Paradise to the women, for it must be confessed that the white rovers gave far better care and treatment of them than did their Indian copartners. Of course, the white men themselves were satisfied with such deals, as were also the Indian men for that matter. Having sold their daughters and sisters for cotton blankets and obsolete rifles and traded their warm furs for flimsy calico and bad whisky, the sons of the soil promptly and cheerfully succumbed to quick consumption and other swift diseases correlated with the blessings of a superior civilization.   <br><br>It was in these days of Arcadian simplicity that Cal Galbraith journeyed through the land and fell sick on the Lower River. It was a refreshing advent in the lives of the good Sisters of the Holy Cross, who gave him shelter and medicine; though they little dreamed of the hot elixir infused into his veins by the touch of their soft hands and their gentle ministrations. Cal Galbraith, became troubled with strange thoughts which clamored for attention till he laid eyes on the Mission girl, Madeline. Yet he gave no sign, biding his time patiently. He strengthened with the coming spring, and when the sun rode the heavens in a golden circle, and the joy and throb of life was in all the land, he gathered his still weak body together and departed.  <br><br>Now, Madeline, the Mission girl, was an orphan. Her white father had failed to give a bald-faced grizzly the trail one day, and had died quickly. Then her Indian mother, having no man to fill the winter cache, had tried the hazardous experiment of waiting till the salmon-run on fifty pounds of flour and half as many of bacon. After that, the baby, Chook-ra, went to live with the good Sisters, and to be thenceforth known by another name.   <br><br>But Madeline still had kinsfolk, the nearest being a dissolute uncle who outraged his vitals with inordinate quantities of the white man's whisky. He strove daily to walk with the gods, and incidentally, his feet sought shorter trails to the grave. When sober he suffered exquisite torture. He had no conscience. To this ancient vagabond Cal Galbraith duly presented himself, and they consumed many words and much tobacco in the conversation that followed. Promises were also made; and in the end the old heathen took a few pounds of dried salmon and his birch-bark canoe, and paddled away to the Mission of the Holy Cross.  <br><br>It is not given the world to know what promises he made and what lies he toldthe Sisters never gossip; but when he returned, upon his swarthy chest there was a brass crucifix, and in his canoe his niece Madeline. That night there was a grand wedding and a potlach; so that for two days to follow there was no fishing done by the village. But in the morning Madeline shook the dust of the Lower River from her moccasins, and with her husband, in a poling-boat, went to live on the Upper River in a place known as the Lower Country. And in the years which followed she was a good wife, sharing her husband's hardships and cooking his food. And she kept him in straight trails, till he learned to save his dust and to work mightily. In the end, he struck it rich and built a cabin in Circle City; and his happiness was such that men who came to visit him in his home-circle became restless at the sight of it and envied him greatly.   <br><br>But the Northland began to mature and social amenities to make their appearance.  <br><br>Hitherto, the Southland had sent forth its sons; but it now belched forth a new exodus- this time of its daughters. Sisters and wives they were not; but they did not fail to put new ideas in the heads of the men, and to elevate the tone of things in ways peculiarly their own. No more did the squaws gather at the dances, go roaring down the center in the good, old Virginia reels, or make merry with jolly 'Dan Tucker.' They fell back on their natural stoicism and uncomplainingly watched the rule of their white sisters from their cabins.   <br><br>Then another exodus came over the mountains from the prolific Southland.  <br><br>This time it was of women that became mighty in the land. Their word was law; their law was steel. They frowned upon the Indian wives, while the other women became mild and walked humbly. There were cowards who became ashamed of their ancient covenants with the daughters of the soil, who looked with a new distaste upon their dark-skinned children; but there were also others--men--who remained true and proud of their aboriginal vows. When it became the fashion to divorce the native wives. Cal Galbraith retained his manhood, and in so doing felt the heavy hand of the women who had come last, knew least, but who ruled the land.   <br><br>One day, the Upper Country, which lies far above Circle City, was pronounced rich. Dog- teams carried the news to Salt Water; golden argosies freighted the lure across the North Pacific; wires and cables sang with the tidings; and the world heard for the first time of the Klondike River and the Yukon Country. Cal Galbraith had lived the years quietly. He had been a good husband to Madeline, and she had blessed him. But somehow discontent fell upon him; he felt vague yearnings for his own kind, for the life he had been shut out from--a general sort of desire, which men sometimes feel, to break out and taste the prime of living. Besides, there drifted down the river wild rumors of the wonderful El Dorado, glowing descriptions of the city of logs and tents, and ludicrous accounts of the che-cha- quas who had rushed in and were stampeding the whole country.  <br><br>Circle City was dead. The world had moved on up river and become a new and most marvelous world.   <br><br>Cal Galbraith grew restless on the edge of things, and wished to see with his own eyes.  <br><br>So, after the wash-up, he weighed in a couple of hundred pounds of dust on the Company's big scales, and took a draft for the same on Dawson. Then he put Tom Dixon in charge of his mines, kissed Madeline good-by, promised to be back before the first mush-ice ran, and took passage on an up-river steamer.   <br><br>Madeline waited, waited through all the three months of daylight. She fed the dogs, gave much of her time to Young Cal, watched the short summer fade away and the sun begin its long journey to the south. And she prayed much in the manner of the Sisters of the Holy Cross. The fall came, and with it there was mush-ice on the Yukon, and Circle City kings returning to the winter's work at their mines, but no Cal Galbraith. Tom Dixon received a letter, however, for his men sledded up her winter's supply of dry pine. The Company received a letter for its dogteams filled her cache with their best provisions, and she was told that her credit was limitless.  <br><br>Through all the ages man has been held the chief instigator of the woes of woman; but in this case the men held their tongues and swore harshly at one of their number who was away, while the women failed utterly to emulate them. So, without needless delay, Madeline heard strange tales of Cal Galbraith's doings; also, of a certain Greek dancer who played with men as children did with bubbles. Now Madeline was an Indian woman, and further, she had no woman friend to whom to go for wise counsel. She prayed and planned by turns, and that night, being quick of resolve and action, she harnessed the dogs, and with Young Cal securely lashed to the sled, stole away.   <br><br>Though the Yukon still ran free, the eddy-ice was growing, and each day saw the river dwindling to a slushy thread. Save him who has done the like, no man may know what she endured in traveling a hundred miles on the rim-ice; nor may they understand the toil and hardship of breaking the two hundred miles of packed ice which remained after the river froze for good. But Madeline was an Indian woman, so she did these things, and one night there came a knock at Malemute Kid's door. Thereat he fed a team of starving dogs, put a healthy youngster to bed, and turned his attention to an exhausted woman. He removed her icebound moccasins while he listened to her tale, and stuck the point of his knife into her feet that he might see how far they were frozen.  <br><br>Despite his tremendous virility, Malemute Kid was possessed of a softer, womanly element, which could win the confidence of a snarling wolf-dog or draw confessions from the most wintry heart. Nor did he seek them. Hearts opened to him as spontaneously as flowers to the sun. Even the priest, Father Roubeau, had been known to confess to him, while the men and women of the Northland were ever knocking at his door--a door from which the latch-string hung always out. To Madeline, he could do no wrong, make no mistake. She had known him from the time she first cast her lot among the people of her father's race; and to her half-barbaric mind it seemed that in him was centered the wisdom of the ages, that between his vision and the future there could be no intervening veil.   <br><br>There were false ideals in the land. The social strictures of Dawson were not synonymous with those of the previous era, and the swift maturity of the Northland involved much wrong. Malemute Kid was aware of this, and he had Cal Galbraith's measure accurately.  <br><br>He knew a hasty word was the father of much evil; besides, he was minded to teach a great lesson and bring shame upon the man. So Stanley Prince, the young mining expert, was called into the conference the following night as was also Lucky Jack Harrington and his violin. That same night, Bettles, who owed a great debt to Malemute Kid, harnessed up Cal Galbraith's dogs, lashed Cal Galbraith, Junior, to the sled, and slipped away in the dark for Stuart River.   <br><br>II 'So; one--two--three, one--two--three. Now reverse! No, no! Start up again, Jack. See--this way.' Prince executed the movement as one should who has led the cotillion.  <br><br>'Now; one--two--three, one--two--three. Reverse! Ah! that's better. Try it again. I say, you know, you mustn't look at your feet. One--two--three, one--twothree. Shorter steps! You are not hanging to the gee-pole just now. Try it over.   <br><br>There! that's the way. One--two--three, one--two--three.' Round and round went Prince and Madeline in an interminable waltz. The table and stools had been shoved over against the wall to increase the room. Malemute Kid sat on the bunk, chin to knees, greatly interested. Jack Harrington sat beside him, scraping away on his violin and following the dancers.  <br><br>It was a unique situation, the undertaking of these three men with the woman.   <br><br>The most pathetic part, perhaps, was the businesslike way in which they went about it.  <br><br>No athlete was ever trained more rigidly for a coming contest, nor wolf-dog for the harness, than was she. But they had good material, for Madeline, unlike most women of her race, in her childhood had escaped the carrying of heavy burdens and the toil of the trail. Besides, she was a clean-limbed, willowy creature, possessed of much grace which had not hitherto been realized. It was this grace which the men strove to bring out and knock into shape.   <br><br>'Trouble with her she learned to dance all wrong,' Prince remarked to the bunk after having deposited his breathless pupil on the table. 'She's quick at picking up; yet I could do better had she never danced a step. But say, Kid, I can't understand this.' Prince imitated a peculiar movement of the shoulders and head--a weakness Madeline suffered from in walking.  <br><br>'Lucky for her she was raised in the Mission,' Malemute Kid answered. 'Packing, you know,--the head-strap. Other Indian women have it bad, but she didn't do any packing till after she married, and then only at first. Saw hard lines with that husband of hers. They went through the Forty-Mile famine together.' 'But can we break it?' 'Don't know.   <br><br>Perhaps long walks with her trainers will make the riffle. Anyway, they'll take it out some, won't they, Madeline?' The girl nodded assent. If Malemute Kid, who knew all things, said so, why it was so. That was all there was about it.  <br><br>She had come over to them, anxious to begin again. Harrington surveyed her in quest of her points much in the same manner men usually do horses. It certainly was not disappointing, for he asked with sudden interest, 'What did that beggarly uncle of yours get anyway?' 'One rifle, one blanket, twenty bottles of hooch. Rifle broke.' She said this last scornfully, as though disgusted at how low her maiden-value had been rated.   <br><br>She spoke fair English, with many peculiarities of her husband's speech, but there was still perceptible the Indian accent, the traditional groping after strange gutturals. Even this her instructors had taken in hand, and with no small success, too.  <br><br>At the next intermission, Prince discovered a new predicament.   <br><br>'I say, Kid,' he said, 'we're wrong, all wrong. She can't learn in moccasins.  <br><br>Put her feet into slippers, and then onto that waxed floor--phew!' Madeline raised a foot and regarded her shapeless house-moccasins dubiously. In previous winters, both at Circle City and Forty-Mile, she had danced many a night away with similar footgear, and there had been nothing the matter.   <br><br>But now--well, if there was anything wrong it was for Malemute Kid to know, not her.  <br><br>But Malemute Kid did know, and he had a good eye for measures; so he put on his cap and mittens and went down the hill to pay Mrs. Eppingwell a call. Her husband, Clove Eppingwell, was prominent in the community as one of the great Government officials.   <br><br>The Kid had noted her slender little foot one night, at the Governor's Ball. And as he also knew her to be as sensible as she was pretty, it was no task to ask of her a certain small favor.  <br><br>On his return, Madeline withdrew for a moment to the inner room. When she reappeared Prince was startled.   <br><br>'By Jove!' he gasped. 'Who'd a' thought it! The little witch! Why my sister-' 'Is an English girl,' interrupted Malemute Kid, 'with an English foot. This girl comes of a small-footed race. Moccasins just broadened her feet healthily, while she did not misshape them by running with the dogs in her childhood.' But this explanation failed utterly to allay Prince's admiration. Harrington's commercial instinct was touched, and as he looked upon the exquisitely turned foot and ankle, there ran through his mind the sordid list--'One rifle, one blanket, twenty bottles of hooch.' Madeline was the wife of a king, a king whose yellow treasure could buy outright a score of fashion's puppets; yet in all her life her feet had known no gear save red-tanned moosehide. At first she had looked in awe at the tiny white-satin slippers; but she had quickly understood the admiration which shone, manlike, in the eyes of the men. Her face flushed with pride. For the moment she was drunken with her woman's loveliness; then she murmured, with increased scorn, 'And one rifle, broke!' So the training went on. Every day Malemute Kid led the girl out on long walks devoted to the correction of her carriage and the shortening of her stride.  <br><br>There was little likelihood of her identity being discovered, for Cal Galbraith and the rest of the Old-Timers were like lost children among the many strangers who had rushed into the land. Besides, the frost of the North has a bitter tongue, and the tender women of the South, to shield their cheeks from its biting caresses, were prone to the use of canvas masks. With faces obscured and bodies lost in squirrel-skin parkas, a mother and daughter, meeting on trail, would pass as strangers.   <br><br>The coaching progressed rapidly. At first it had been slow, but later a sudden acceleration had manifested itself. This began from the moment Madeline tried on the white-satin slippers, and in so doing found herself. The pride of her renegade father, apart from any natural self-esteem she might possess, at that instant received its birth. Hitherto, she had deemed herself a woman of an alien breed, of inferior stock, purchased by her lord's favor. Her husband had seemed to her a god, who had lifted her, through no essential virtues on her part, to his own godlike level. But she had never forgotten, even when Young Cal was born, that she was not of his people. As he had been a god, so had his womenkind been goddesses. She might have contrasted herself with them, but she had never compared.  <br><br>It might have been that familiarity bred contempt; however, be that as it may, she had ultimately come to understand these roving white men, and to weigh them.   <br><br>True, her mind was dark to deliberate analysis, but she yet possessed her woman's clarity of vision in such matters. On the night of the slippers she had measured the bold, open admiration of her three man-friends; and for the first time comparison had suggested itself. It was only a foot and an ankle, but--but comparison could not, in the nature of things, cease at that point. She judged herself by their standards till the divinity of her white sisters was shattered. After all, they were only women, and why should she not exalt herself to their midst? In doing these things she learned where she lacked and with the knowledge of her weakness came her strength. And so mightily did she strive that her three trainers often marveled late into the night over the eternal mystery of woman.  <br><br>In this way Thanksgiving Night drew near. At irregular intervals Bettles sent word down from Stuart River regarding the welfare of Young Cal. The time of their return was approaching. More than once a casual caller, hearing dance-music and the rhythmic pulse of feet, entered, only to find Harrington scraping away and the other two beating time or arguing noisily over a mooted step. Madeline was never in evidence, having precipitately fled to the inner room.   <br><br>On one of these nights Cal Galbraith dropped in. Encouraging news had just come down from Stuart River, and Madeline had surpassed herself--not in walk alone, and carriage and grace, but in womanly roguishness. They had indulged in sharp repartee and she had defended herself brilliantly; and then, yielding to the intoxication of the moment, and of her own power, she had bullied, and mastered, and wheedled, and patronized them with most astonishing success. And instinctively, involuntarily, they had bowed, not to her beauty, her wisdom, her wit, but to that indefinable something in woman to which man yields yet cannot name.  <br><br>The room was dizzy with sheer delight as she and Prince whirled through the last dance of the evening. Harrington was throwing in inconceivable flourishes, while Malemute Kid, utterly abandoned, had seized the broom and was executing mad gyrations on his own account.   <br><br>At this instant the door shook with a heavy rap-rap, and their quick glances noted the lifting of the latch. But they had survived similar situations before. Harrington never broke a note. Madeline shot through the waiting door to the inner room. The broom went hurtling under the bunk, and by the time Cal Galbraith and Louis Savoy got their heads in, Malemute Kid and Prince were in each other's arms, wildly schottisching down the room.  <br><br>As a rule, Indian women do not make a practice of fainting on provocation, but Madeline came as near to it as she ever had in her life. For an hour she crouched on the floor, listening to the heavy voices of the men rumbling up and down in mimic thunder. Like familiar chords of childhood melodies, every intonation, every trick of her husband's voice swept in upon her, fluttering her heart and weakening her knees till she lay half- fainting against the door. It was well she could neither see nor hear when he took his departure.   <br><br>'When do you expect to go back to Circle City?' Malemute Kid asked simply.  <br><br>'Haven't thought much about it,' he replied. 'Don't think till after the ice breaks.' 'And Madeline?'   <br><br>He flushed at the question, and there was a quick droop to his eyes. Malemute Kid could have despised him for that, had he known men less. As it was, his gorge rose against the wives and daughters who had come into the land, and not satisfied with usurping the place of the native women, had put unclean thoughts in the heads of the men and made them ashamed.  <br><br>'I guess she's all right,' the Circle City King answered hastily, and in an apologetic manner. 'Tom Dixon's got charge of my interests, you know, and he sees to it that she has everything she wants.' Malemute Kid laid hand upon his arm and hushed him suddenly. They had stepped without. Overhead, the aurora, a gorgeous wanton, flaunted miracles of color; beneath lay the sleeping town. Far below, a solitary dog gave tongue.   <br><br>The King again began to speak, but the Kid pressed his hand for silence. The sound multiplied. Dog after dog took up the strain till the full-throated chorus swayed the night.  <br><br>To him who hears for the first time this weird song, is told the first and greatest secret of the Northland; to him who has heard it often, it is the solemn knell of lost endeavor. It is the plaint of tortured souls, for in it is invested the heritage of the North, the suffering of countless generations--the warning and the requiem to the world's estrays.   <br><br>Cal Galbraith shivered slightly as it died away in half-caught sobs. The Kid read his thoughts openly, and wandered back with him through all the weary days of famine and disease; and with him was also the patient Madeline, sharing his pains and perils, never doubting, never complaining. His mind's retina vibrated to a score of pictures, stern, clear-cut, and the hand of the past drew back with heavy fingers on his heart. It was the psychological moment. Malemute Kid was halftempted to play his reserve card and win the game; but the lesson was too mild as yet, and he let it pass. The next instant they had gripped hands, and the King's beaded moccasins were drawing protests from the outraged snow as he crunched down the hill.  <br><br>Madeline in collapse was another woman to the mischievous creature of an hour before, whose laughter had been so infectious and whose heightened color and flashing eyes had made her teachers for the while forget. Weak and nerveless, she sat in the chair just as she had been dropped there by Prince and Harrington.   <br><br>Malemute Kid frowned. This would never do. When the time of meeting her husband came to hand, she must carry things off with high-handed imperiousness. It was very necessary she should do it after the manner of white women, else the victory would be no victory at all. So he talked to her, sternly, without mincing of words, and initiated her into the weaknesses of his own sex, till she came to understand what simpletons men were after all, and why the word of their women was law.  <br><br>A few days before Thanksgiving Night, Malemute Kid made another call on Mrs.   <br><br>Eppingwell. She promptly overhauled her feminine fripperies, paid a protracted visit to the dry-goods department of the P. C. Company, and returned with the Kid to make Madeline's acquaintance. After that came a period such as the cabin had never seen before, and what with cutting, and fitting, and basting, and stitching, and numerous other wonderful and unknowable things, the male conspirators were more often banished the premises than not. At such times the Opera House opened its double storm-doors to them.  <br><br>So often did they put their heads together, and so deeply did they drink to curious toasts, that the loungers scented unknown creeks of incalculable richness, and it is known that several checha-quas and at least one Old-Timer kept their stampeding packs stored behind the bar, ready to hit the trail at a moment's notice.   <br><br>Mrs. Eppingwell was a woman of capacity; so, when she turned Madeline over to her trainers on Thanksgiving Night she was so transformed that they were almost afraid of her. Prince wrapped a Hudson Bay blanket about her with a mock reverence more real than feigned, while Malemute Kid, whose arm she had taken, found it a severe trial to resume his wonted mentorship. Harrington, with the list of purchases still running through his head, dragged along in the rear, nor opened his mouth once all the way down into the town. When they came to the back door of the Opera House they took the blanket from Madeline's shoulders and spread it on the snow. Slipping out of Prince's moccasins, she stepped upon it in new satin slippers. The masquerade was at its height. She hesitated, but they jerked open the door and shoved her in. Then they ran around to come in by the front entrance.  <br><br>III 'Where is Freda?' the Old-Timers questioned, while the che-cha-quas were equally energetic in asking who Freda was. The ballroom buzzed with her name.   <br><br>It was on everybody's lips. Grizzled 'sour-dough boys,' day-laborers at the mines but proud of their degree, either patronized the spruce-looking tenderfeet and lied eloquently- the 'sour-dough boys' being specially created to toy with truth--or gave them savage looks of indignation because of their ignorance. Perhaps forty kings of the Upper and Lower Countries were on the floor, each deeming himself hot on the trail and sturdily backing his judgment with the yellow dust of the realm. An assistant was sent to the man at the scales, upon whom had fallen the burden of weighing up the sacks, while several of the gamblers, with the rules of chance at their finger-ends, made up alluring books on the field and favorites.  <br><br>Which was Freda? Time and again the 'Greek Dancer' was thought to have been discovered, but each discovery brought panic to the betting ring and a frantic registering of new wagers by those who wished to hedge. Malemute Kid took an interest in the hunt, his advent being hailed uproariously by the revelers, who knew him to a man. The Kid had a good eye for the trick of a step, and ear for the lilt of a voice, and his private choice was a marvelous creature who scintillated as the 'Aurora Borealis.' But the Greek dancer was too subtle for even his penetration. The majority of the gold-hunters seemed to have centered their verdict on the 'Russian Princess,' who was the most graceful in the room, and hence could be no other than Freda Moloof.   <br><br>During a quadrille a roar of satisfaction went up. She was discovered. At previous balls, in the figure, 'all hands round,' Freda had displayed an inimitable step and variation peculiarly her own. As the figure was called, the 'Russian Princess' gave the unique rhythm to limb and body. A chorus of I-told-you-so's shook the squared roof-beams, when lo! it was noticed that 'Aurora Borealis' and another masque, the 'Spirit of the Pole,' were performing the same trick equally well. And when two twin 'Sun-Dogs' and a 'Frost Queen' followed suit, a second assistant was dispatched to the aid of the man at the scales.  <br><br>Bettles came off trail in the midst of the excitement, descending upon them in a hurricane of frost. His rimed brows turned to cataracts as he whirled about; his mustache, still frozen, seemed gemmed with diamonds and turned the light in varicolored rays; while the flying feet slipped on the chunks of ice which rattled from his moccasins and German socks. A Northland dance is quite an informal affair, the men of the creeks and trails having lost whatever fastidiousness they might have at one time possessed; and only in the high official circles are conventions at all observed. Here, caste carried no significance. Millionaires and paupers, dog-drivers and mounted policemen joined hands with 'ladies in the center,' and swept around the circle performing most remarkable capers. Primitive in their pleasure, boisterous and rough, they displayed no rudeness, but rather a crude chivalry more genuine than the most polished courtesy.   <br><br>In his quest for the 'Greek Dancer,' Cal Galbraith managed to get into the same set with the 'Russian Princess,' toward whom popular suspicion had turned.  <br><br>But by the time he had guided her through one dance, he was willing not only to stake his millions that she was not Freda, but that he had had his arm about her waist before. When or where he could not tell, but the puzzling sense of familiarity so wrought upon him that he turned his attention to the discovery of her identity. Malemute Kid might have aided him instead of occasionally taking the Princess for a few turns and talking earnestly to her in low tones. But it was Jack Harrington who paid the 'Russian Princess' the most assiduous court. Once he drew Cal Galbraith aside and hazarded wild guesses as to who she was, and explained to him that he was going in to win. That rankled the Circle City King, for man is not by nature monogamic, and he forgot both Madeline and Freda in the new quest.   <br><br>It was soon noised about that the 'Russian Princess' was not Freda Moloof. Interest deepened. Here was a fresh enigma. They knew Freda though they could not find her, but here was somebody they had found and did not know. Even the women could not place her, and they knew every good dancer in the camp. Many took her for one of the official clique, indulging in a silly escapade. Not a few asserted she would disappear before the unmasking. Others were equally positive that she was the woman-reporter of the Kansas City Star, come to write them up at ninety dollars per column. And the men at the scales worked busily.  <br><br>At one o'clock every couple took to the floor. The unmasking began amid laughter and delight, like that of carefree children. There was no end of Oh's and Ah's as mask after mask was lifted. The scintillating 'Aurora Borealis' became the brawny negress whose income from washing the community's clothes ran at about five hundred a month. The twin 'Sun-Dogs' discovered mustaches on their upper lips, and were recognized as brother Fraction-Kings of El Dorado. In one of the most prominent sets, and the slowest in uncovering, was Cal Galbraith with the 'Spirit of the Pole.' Opposite him was Jack Harrington and the 'Russian Princess.' The rest had discovered themselves, yet the 'Greek Dancer' was still missing. All eyes were upon the group. Cal Galbraith, in response to their cries, lifted his partner's mask. Freda's wonderful face and brilliant eyes flashed out upon them. A roar went up, to be squelched suddenly in the new and absorbing mystery of the 'Russian Princess.' Her face was still hidden, and Jack Harrington was struggling with her. The dancers tittered on the tiptoes of expectancy. He crushed her dainty costume roughly, and then--and then the revelers exploded. The joke was on them. They had danced all night with a tabooed native woman.   <br><br>But those that knew, and they were many, ceased abruptly, and a hush fell upon the room.  <br><br>Cal Galbraith crossed over with great strides, angrily, and spoke to Madeline in polyglot Chinook. But she retained her composure, apparently oblivious to the fact that she was the cynosure of all eyes, and answered him in English. She showed neither fright nor anger, and Malemute Kid chuckled at her well-bred equanimity. The King felt baffled, defeated; his common Siwash wife had passed beyond him.   <br><br>'Come!' he said finally. 'Come on home.' 'I beg pardon,' she replied; 'I have agreed to go to supper with Mr. Harrington. Besides, there's no end of dances promised.'  <br><br>Harrington extended his arm to lead her away. He evinced not the slightest disinclination toward showing his back, but Malemute Kid had by this time edged in closer. The Circle City King was stunned. Twice his hand dropped to his belt, and twice the Kid gathered himself to spring; but the retreating couple passed through the supper-room door where canned oysters were spread at five dollars the plate.   <br><br>The crowd sighed audibly, broke up into couples, and followed them. Freda pouted and went in with Cal Galbraith; but she had a good heart and a sure tongue, and she spoiled his oysters for him. What she said is of no importance, but his face went red and white at intervals, and he swore repeatedly and savagely at himself.  <br><br>The supper-room was filled with a pandemonium of voices, which ceased suddenly as Cal Galbraith stepped over to his wife's table. Since the unmasking considerable weights of dust had been placed as to the outcome. Everybody watched with breathless interest.   <br><br>Harrington's blue eyes were steady, but under the overhanging tablecloth a Smith & Wesson balanced on his knee. Madeline looked up, casually, with little interest.  <br><br>'May--may I have the next round dance with you?' the King stuttered.   <br><br>The wife of the King glanced at her card and inclined her head.                                    <br><br>"
45,To Build a Fire,"Day had broken cold and grey, exceedingly cold and grey, when the man turned aside from the main Yukon trail and climbed the high earth- bank, where a dim and little-travelled trail led eastward through the fat spruce timberland. It was a steep bank, and he paused for breath at the top, excusing the act to himself by looking at his watch. It was nine o'clock. There was no sun nor hint of sun, though there was not a cloud in the sky. It was a clear day, and yet there seemed an intangible pall over the face of things, a subtle gloom that made the day dark, and that was due to the absence of sun. This fact did not worry the man. He was used to the lack of sun. It had been days since he had seen the sun, and he knew that a few more days must pass before that cheerful orb, due south, would just peep above the sky- line and dip immediately from view.  <br><br>  The man flung a look back along the way he had come. The Yukon lay a mile wide and hidden under three feet of ice. On top of this ice were as many feet of snow. It was all pure white, rolling in gentle undulations where the ice-jams of the freeze-up had formed. North and south, as far as his eye could see, it was unbroken white, save for a dark hair-line that curved and twisted from around the spruce- covered island to the south, and that curved and twisted away into the north, where it disappeared behind another spruce-covered island. This dark hair-line was the trail--the main trail--that led south five hundred miles to the Chilcoot Pass, Dyea, and salt water; and that led north seventy miles to Dawson, and still on to the north a thousand miles to Nulato, and finally to St. Michael on Bering Sea, a thousand miles and half a thousand more.  <br><br>  But all this--the mysterious, far-reaching hairline trail, the absence of sun from the sky, the tremendous cold, and the strangeness and weirdness of it all--made no impression on the man. It was not because he was long used to it. He was a new-comer in the land, a chechaquo, and this was his first winter. The trouble with him was that he was without imagination. He was quick and alert in the things of life, but only in the things, and not in the significances. Fifty degrees below zero meant eighty odd degrees of frost. Such fact impressed him as being cold and uncomfortable, and that was all. It did not lead him to meditate upon his frailty as a creature of temperature, and upon man's frailty in general, able only to live within certain narrow limits of heat and cold; and from there on it did not lead him to the conjectural field of immortality and man's place in the universe. Fifty degrees below zero stood for a bite of frost that hurt and that must be guarded against by the use of mittens, ear-flaps, warm moccasins, and thick socks. Fifty degrees below zero was to him just precisely fifty degrees below zero. That there should be anything more to it than that was a thought that never entered his head.  <br><br>  As he turned to go on, he spat speculatively. There was a sharp, explosive crackle that startled him. He spat again. And again, in the air, before it could fall to the snow, the spittle crackled. He knew that at fifty below spittle crackled on the snow, but this spittle had crackled in the air. Undoubtedly it was colder than fifty below--how much colder he did not know. But the temperature did not matter. He was bound for the old claim on the left fork of Henderson Creek, where the boys were already. They had come over across the divide from the Indian Creek country, while he had come the roundabout way to take a look at the possibilities of getting out logs in the spring from the islands in the Yukon. He would be in to camp by six o'clock; a bit after dark, it was true, but the boys would be there, a fire would be going, and a hot supper would be ready. As for lunch, he pressed his hand against the protruding bundle under his jacket. It was also under his shirt, wrapped up in a handkerchief and lying against the naked skin. It was the only way to keep the biscuits from freezing. He smiled agreeably to himself as he thought of those biscuits, each cut open and sopped in bacon grease, and each enclosing a generous slice of fried bacon.  <br><br>  He plunged in among the big spruce trees. The trail was faint. A foot of snow had fallen since the last sled had passed over, and he was glad he was without a sled, travelling light. In fact, he carried nothing but the lunch wrapped in the handkerchief. He was surprised, however, at the cold. It certainly was cold, he concluded, as he rubbed his numbed nose and cheek-bones with his mittened hand. He was a warm-whiskered man, but the hair on his face did not protect the high cheek-bones and the eager nose that thrust itself aggressively into the frosty air.  <br><br>  At the man's heels trotted a dog, a big native husky, the proper wolf-dog, grey-coated and without any visible or temperamental difference from its brother, the wild wolf. The animal was depressed by the tremendous cold. It knew that it was no time for travelling. Its instinct told it a truer tale than was told to the man by the man's judgment. In reality, it was not merely colder than fifty below zero; it was colder than sixty below, than seventy below. It was seventy-five below zero. Since the freezing-point is thirty-two above zero, it meant that one hundred and seven degrees of frost obtained. The dog did not know anything about thermometers. Possibly in its brain there was no sharp consciousness of a condition of very cold such as was in the man's brain. But the brute had its instinct. It experienced a vague but menacing apprehension that subdued it and made it slink along at the man's heels, and that made it question eagerly every unwonted movement of the man as if expecting him to go into camp or to seek shelter somewhere and build a fire. The dog had learned fire, and it wanted fire, or else to burrow under the snow and cuddle its warmth away from the air.  <br><br>  The frozen moisture of its breathing had settled on its fur in a fine powder of frost, and especially were its jowls, muzzle, and eyelashes whitened by its crystalled breath. The man's red beard and moustache were likewise frosted, but more solidly, the deposit taking the form of ice and increasing with every warm, moist breath he exhaled. Also, the man was chewing tobacco, and the muzzle of ice held his lips so rigidly that he was unable to clear his chin when he expelled the juice. The result was that a crystal beard of the colour and solidity of amber was increasing its length on his chin. If he fell down it would shatter itself, like glass, into brittle fragments. But he did not mind the appendage. It was the penalty all tobacco- chewers paid in that country, and he had been out before in two cold snaps. They had not been so cold as this, he knew, but by the spirit thermometer at Sixty Mile he knew they had been registered at fifty below and at fifty-five.  <br><br>  He held on through the level stretch of woods for several miles, crossed a wide flat of nigger-heads, and dropped down a bank to the frozen bed of a small stream. This was Henderson Creek, and he knew he was ten miles from the forks. He looked at his watch. It was ten o'clock. He was making four miles an hour, and he calculated that he would arrive at the forks at half-past twelve. He decided to celebrate that event by eating his lunch there.  <br><br>  The dog dropped in again at his heels, with a tail drooping discouragement, as the man swung along the creek-bed. The furrow of the old sled-trail was plainly visible, but a dozen inches of snow covered the marks of the last runners. In a month no man had come up or down that silent creek. The man held steadily on. He was not much given to thinking, and just then particularly he had nothing to think about save that he would eat lunch at the forks and that at six o'clock he would be in camp with the boys. There was nobody to talk to and, had there been, speech would have been impossible because of the ice-muzzle on his mouth. So he continued monotonously to chew tobacco and to increase the length of his amber beard.  <br><br>  Once in a while the thought reiterated itself that it was very cold and that he had never experienced such cold. As he walked along he rubbed his cheek-bones and nose with the back of his mittened hand. He did this automatically, now and again changing hands. But rub as he would, the instant he stopped his cheek-bones went numb, and the following instant the end of his nose went numb. He was sure to frost his cheeks; he knew that, and experienced a pang of regret that he had not devised a nose-strap of the sort Bud wore in cold snaps. Such a strap passed across the cheeks, as well, and saved them. But it didn't matter much, after all. What were frosted cheeks? A bit painful, that was all; they were never serious.  <br><br>  Empty as the man's mind was of thoughts, he was keenly observant, and he noticed the changes in the creek, the curves and bends and timber- jams, and always he sharply noted where he placed his feet. Once, coming around a bend, he shied abruptly, like a startled horse, curved away from the place where he had been walking, and retreated several paces back along the trail. The creek he knew was frozen clear to the bottom--no creek could contain water in that arctic winter--but he knew also that there were springs that bubbled out from the hillsides and ran along under the snow and on top the ice of the creek. He knew that the coldest snaps never froze these springs, and he knew likewise their danger. They were traps. They hid pools of water under the snow that might be three inches deep, or three feet. Sometimes a skin of ice half an inch thick covered them, and in turn was covered by the snow. Sometimes there were alternate layers of water and ice-skin, so that when one broke through he kept on breaking through for a while, sometimes wetting himself to the waist.  <br><br>  That was why he had shied in such panic. He had felt the give under his feet and heard the crackle of a snow-hidden ice-skin. And to get his feet wet in such a temperature meant trouble and danger. At the very least it meant delay, for he would be forced to stop and build a fire, and under its protection to bare his feet while he dried his socks and moccasins. He stood and studied the creek-bed and its banks, and decided that the flow of water came from the right. He reflected awhile, rubbing his nose and cheeks, then skirted to the left, stepping gingerly and testing the footing for each step. Once clear of the danger, he took a fresh chew of tobacco and swung along at his four-mile gait.  <br><br>  In the course of the next two hours he came upon several similar traps. Usually the snow above the hidden pools had a sunken, candied appearance that advertised the danger. Once again, however, he had a close call; and once, suspecting danger, he compelled the dog to go on in front. The dog did not want to go. It hung back until the man shoved it forward, and then it went quickly across the white, unbroken surface. Suddenly it broke through, floundered to one side, and got away to firmer footing. It had wet its forefeet and legs, and almost immediately the water that clung to it turned to ice. It made quick efforts to lick the ice off its legs, then dropped down in the snow and began to bite out the ice that had formed between the toes. This was a matter of instinct. To permit the ice to remain would mean sore feet. It did not know this. It merely obeyed the mysterious prompting that arose from the deep crypts of its being. But the man knew, having achieved a judgment on the subject, and he removed the mitten from his right hand and helped tear out the ice- particles. He did not expose his fingers more than a minute, and was astonished at the swift numbness that smote them. It certainly was cold. He pulled on the mitten hastily, and beat the hand savagely across his chest.  <br><br>  At twelve o'clock the day was at its brightest. Yet the sun was too far south on its winter journey to clear the horizon. The bulge of the earth intervened between it and Henderson Creek, where the man walked under a clear sky at noon and cast no shadow. At half-past twelve, to the minute, he arrived at the forks of the creek. He was pleased at the speed he had made. If he kept it up, he would certainly be with the boys by six. He unbuttoned his jacket and shirt and drew forth his lunch. The action consumed no more than a quarter of a minute, yet in that brief moment the numbness laid hold of the exposed fingers. He did not put the mitten on, but, instead, struck the fingers a dozen sharp smashes against his leg. Then he sat down on a snow-covered log to eat. The sting that followed upon the striking of his fingers against his leg ceased so quickly that he was startled, he had had no chance to take a bite of biscuit. He struck the fingers repeatedly and returned them to the mitten, baring the other hand for the purpose of eating. He tried to take a mouthful, but the ice-muzzle prevented. He had forgotten to build a fire and thaw out. He chuckled at his foolishness, and as he chuckled he noted the numbness creeping into the exposed fingers. Also, he noted that the stinging which had first come to his toes when he sat down was already passing away. He wondered whether the toes were warm or numbed. He moved them inside the moccasins and decided that they were numbed.  <br><br>  He pulled the mitten on hurriedly and stood up. He was a bit frightened. He stamped up and down until the stinging returned into the feet. It certainly was cold, was his thought. That man from Sulphur Creek had spoken the truth when telling how cold it sometimes got in the country. And he had laughed at him at the time! That showed one must not be too sure of things. There was no mistake about it, it was cold. He strode up and down, stamping his feet and threshing his arms, until reassured by the returning warmth. Then he got out matches and proceeded to make a fire. From the undergrowth, where high water of the previous spring had lodged a supply of seasoned twigs, he got his firewood. Working carefully from a small beginning, he soon had a roaring fire, over which he thawed the ice from his face and in the protection of which he ate his biscuits. For the moment the cold of space was outwitted. The dog took satisfaction in the fire, stretching out close enough for warmth and far enough away to escape being singed.  <br><br>  When the man had finished, he filled his pipe and took his comfortable time over a smoke. Then he pulled on his mittens, settled the ear-flaps of his cap firmly about his ears, and took the creek trail up the left fork. The dog was disappointed and yearned back toward the fire. This man did not know cold. Possibly all the generations of his ancestry had been ignorant of cold, of real cold, of cold one hundred and seven degrees below freezing-point. But the dog knew; all its ancestry knew, and it had inherited the knowledge. And it knew that it was not good to walk abroad in such fearful cold. It was the time to lie snug in a hole in the snow and wait for a curtain of cloud to be drawn across the face of outer space whence this cold came. On the other hand, there was keen intimacy between the dog and the man. The one was the toil-slave of the other, and the only caresses it had ever received were the caresses of the whip- lash and of harsh and menacing throat-sounds that threatened the whip-lash. So the dog made no effort to communicate its apprehension to the man. It was not concerned in the welfare of the man; it was for its own sake that it yearned back toward the fire. But the man whistled, and spoke to it with the sound of whip-lashes, and the dog swung in at the man's heels and followed after.  <br><br>  The man took a chew of tobacco and proceeded to start a new amber beard. Also, his moist breath quickly powdered with white his moustache, eyebrows, and lashes. There did not seem to be so many springs on the left fork of the Henderson, and for half an hour the man saw no signs of any. And then it happened. At a place where there were no signs, where the soft, unbroken snow seemed to advertise solidity beneath, the man broke through. It was not deep. He wetted himself half-way to the knees before he floundered out to the firm crust.  <br><br>  He was angry, and cursed his luck aloud. He had hoped to get into camp with the boys at six o'clock, and this would delay him an hour, for he would have to build a fire and dry out his foot-gear. This was imperative at that low temperature--he knew that much; and he turned aside to the bank, which he climbed. On top, tangled in the underbrush about the trunks of several small spruce trees, was a high-water deposit of dry firewood--sticks and twigs principally, but also larger portions of seasoned branches and fine, dry, last-year's grasses. He threw down several large pieces on top of the snow. This served for a foundation and prevented the young flame from drowning itself in the snow it otherwise would melt. The flame he got by touching a match to a small shred of birch-bark that he took from his pocket. This burned even more readily than paper. Placing it on the foundation, he fed the young flame with wisps of dry grass and with the tiniest dry twigs.  <br><br>  He worked slowly and carefully, keenly aware of his danger. Gradually, as the flame grew stronger, he increased the size of the twigs with which he fed it. He squatted in the snow, pulling the twigs out from their entanglement in the brush and feeding directly to the flame. He knew there must be no failure. When it is seventy- five below zero, a man must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire--that is, if his feet are wet. If his feet are dry, and he fails, he can run along the trail for half a mile and restore his circulation. But the circulation of wet and freezing feet cannot be restored by running when it is seventy-five below. No matter how fast he runs, the wet feet will freeze the harder.  <br><br>  All this the man knew. The old-timer on Sulphur Creek had told him about it the previous fall, and now he was appreciating the advice. Already all sensation had gone out of his feet. To build the fire he had been forced to remove his mittens, and the fingers had quickly gone numb. His pace of four miles an hour had kept his heart pumping blood to the surface of his body and to all the extremities. But the instant he stopped, the action of the pump eased down. The cold of space smote the unprotected tip of the planet, and he, being on that unprotected tip, received the full force of the blow. The blood of his body recoiled before it. The blood was alive, like the dog, and like the dog it wanted to hide away and cover itself up from the fearful cold. So long as he walked four miles an hour, he pumped that blood, willy-nilly, to the surface; but now it ebbed away and sank down into the recesses of his body. The extremities were the first to feel its absence. His wet feet froze the faster, and his exposed fingers numbed the faster, though they had not yet begun to freeze. Nose and cheeks were already freezing, while the skin of all his body chilled as it lost its blood.  <br><br>  But he was safe. Toes and nose and cheeks would be only touched by the frost, for the fire was beginning to burn with strength. He was feeding it with twigs the size of his finger. In another minute he would be able to feed it with branches the size of his wrist, and then he could remove his wet foot-gear, and, while it dried, he could keep his naked feet warm by the fire, rubbing them at first, of course, with snow. The fire was a success. He was safe. He remembered the advice of the old-timer on Sulphur Creek, and smiled. The old-timer had been very serious in laying down the law that no man must travel alone in the Klondike after fifty below. Well, here he was; he had had the accident; he was alone; and he had saved himself. Those old-timers were rather womanish, some of them, he thought. All a man had to do was to keep his head, and he was all right. Any man who was a man could travel alone. But it was surprising, the rapidity with which his cheeks and nose were freezing. And he had not thought his fingers could go lifeless in so short a time. Lifeless they were, for he could scarcely make them move together to grip a twig, and they seemed remote from his body and from him. When he touched a twig, he had to look and see whether or not he had hold of it. The wires were pretty well down between him and his finger-ends.  <br><br>  All of which counted for little. There was the fire, snapping and crackling and promising life with every dancing flame. He started to untie his moccasins. They were coated with ice; the thick German socks were like sheaths of iron half-way to the knees; and the mocassin strings were like rods of steel all twisted and knotted as by some conflagration. For a moment he tugged with his numbed fingers, then, realizing the folly of it, he drew his sheath-knife.  <br><br>  But before he could cut the strings, it happened. It was his own fault or, rather, his mistake. He should not have built the fire under the spruce tree. He should have built it in the open. But it had been easier to pull the twigs from the brush and drop them directly on the fire. Now the tree under which he had done this carried a weight of snow on its boughs. No wind had blown for weeks, and each bough was fully freighted. Each time he had pulled a twig he had communicated a slight agitation to the tree--an imperceptible agitation, so far as he was concerned, but an agitation sufficient to bring about the disaster. High up in the tree one bough capsized its load of snow. This fell on the boughs beneath, capsizing them. This process continued, spreading out and involving the whole tree. It grew like an avalanche, and it descended without warning upon the man and the fire, and the fire was blotted out! Where it had burned was a mantle of fresh and disordered snow.  <br><br>  The man was shocked. It was as though he had just heard his own sentence of death. For a moment he sat and stared at the spot where the fire had been. Then he grew very calm. Perhaps the old-timer on Sulphur Creek was right. If he had only had a trail-mate he would have been in no danger now. The trail-mate could have built the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire over again, and this second time there must be no failure. Even if he succeeded, he would most likely lose some toes. His feet must be badly frozen by now, and there would be some time before the second fire was ready.  <br><br>  Such were his thoughts, but he did not sit and think them. He was busy all the time they were passing through his mind, he made a new foundation for a fire, this time in the open; where no treacherous tree could blot it out. Next, he gathered dry grasses and tiny twigs from the high-water flotsam. He could not bring his fingers together to pull them out, but he was able to gather them by the handful. In this way he got many rotten twigs and bits of green moss that were undesirable, but it was the best he could do. He worked methodically, even collecting an armful of the larger branches to be used later when the fire gathered strength. And all the while the dog sat and watched him, a certain yearning wistfulness in its eyes, for it looked upon him as the fire-provider, and the fire was slow in coming.  <br><br>  When all was ready, the man reached in his pocket for a second piece of birch-bark. He knew the bark was there, and, though he could not feel it with his fingers, he could hear its crisp rustling as he fumbled for it. Try as he would, he could not clutch hold of it. And all the time, in his consciousness, was the knowledge that each instant his feet were freezing. This thought tended to put him in a panic, but he fought against it and kept calm. He pulled on his mittens with his teeth, and threshed his arms back and forth, beating his hands with all his might against his sides. He did this sitting down, and he stood up to do it; and all the while the dog sat in the snow, its wolf-brush of a tail curled around warmly over its forefeet, its sharp wolf-ears pricked forward intently as it watched the man. And the man as he beat and threshed with his arms and hands, felt a great surge of envy as he regarded the creature that was warm and secure in its natural covering.  <br><br>  After a time he was aware of the first far-away signals of sensation in his beaten fingers. The faint tingling grew stronger till it evolved into a stinging ache that was excruciating, but which the man hailed with satisfaction. He stripped the mitten from his right hand and fetched forth the birch-bark. The exposed fingers were quickly going numb again. Next he brought out his bunch of sulphur matches. But the tremendous cold had already driven the life out of his fingers. In his effort to separate one match from the others, the whole bunch fell in the snow. He tried to pick it out of the snow, but failed. The dead fingers could neither touch nor clutch. He was very careful. He drove the thought of his freezing feet; and nose, and cheeks, out of his mind, devoting his whole soul to the matches. He watched, using the sense of vision in place of that of touch, and when he saw his fingers on each side the bunch, he closed them--that is, he willed to close them, for the wires were drawn, and the fingers did not obey. He pulled the mitten on the right hand, and beat it fiercely against his knee. Then, with both mittened hands, he scooped the bunch of matches, along with much snow, into his lap. Yet he was no better off.  <br><br>  After some manipulation he managed to get the bunch between the heels of his mittened hands. In this fashion he carried it to his mouth. The ice crackled and snapped when by a violent effort he opened his mouth. He drew the lower jaw in, curled the upper lip out of the way, and scraped the bunch with his upper teeth in order to separate a match. He succeeded in getting one, which he dropped on his lap. He was no better off. He could not pick it up. Then he devised a way. He picked it up in his teeth and scratched it on his leg. Twenty times he scratched before he succeeded in lighting it. As it flamed he held it with his teeth to the birch-bark. But the burning brimstone went up his nostrils and into his lungs, causing him to cough spasmodically. The match fell into the snow and went out.  <br><br>  The old-timer on Sulphur Creek was right, he thought in the moment of controlled despair that ensued: after fifty below, a man should travel with a partner. He beat his hands, but failed in exciting any sensation. Suddenly he bared both hands, removing the mittens with his teeth. He caught the whole bunch between the heels of his hands. His arm-muscles not being frozen enabled him to press the hand-heels tightly against the matches. Then he scratched the bunch along his leg. It flared into flame, seventy sulphur matches at once! There was no wind to blow them out. He kept his head to one side to escape the strangling fumes, and held the blazing bunch to the birch-bark. As he so held it, he became aware of sensation in his hand. His flesh was burning. He could smell it. Deep down below the surface he could feel it. The sensation developed into pain that grew acute. And still he endured it, holding the flame of the matches clumsily to the bark that would not light readily because his own burning hands were in the way, absorbing most of the flame.  <br><br>  At last, when he could endure no more, he jerked his hands apart. The blazing matches fell sizzling into the snow, but the birch-bark was alight. He began laying dry grasses and the tiniest twigs on the flame. He could not pick and choose, for he had to lift the fuel between the heels of his hands. Small pieces of rotten wood and green moss clung to the twigs, and he bit them off as well as he could with his teeth. He cherished the flame carefully and awkwardly. It meant life, and it must not perish. The withdrawal of blood from the surface of his body now made him begin to shiver, and he grew more awkward. A large piece of green moss fell squarely on the little fire. He tried to poke it out with his fingers, but his shivering frame made him poke too far, and he disrupted the nucleus of the little fire, the burning grasses and tiny twigs separating and scattering. He tried to poke them together again, but in spite of the tenseness of the effort, his shivering got away with him, and the twigs were hopelessly scattered. Each twig gushed a puff of smoke and went out. The fire-provider had failed. As he looked apathetically about him, his eyes chanced on the dog, sitting across the ruins of the fire from him, in the snow, making restless, hunching movements, slightly lifting one forefoot and then the other, shifting its weight back and forth on them with wistful eagerness.  <br><br>  The sight of the dog put a wild idea into his head. He remembered the tale of the man, caught in a blizzard, who killed a steer and crawled inside the carcass, and so was saved. He would kill the dog and bury his hands in the warm body until the numbness went out of them. Then he could build another fire. He spoke to the dog, calling it to him; but in his voice was a strange note of fear that frightened the animal, who had never known the man to speak in such way before. Something was the matter, and its suspicious nature sensed danger,--it knew not what danger but somewhere, somehow, in its brain arose an apprehension of the man. It flattened its ears down at the sound of the man's voice, and its restless, hunching movements and the liftings and shiftings of its forefeet became more pronounced but it would not come to the man. He got on his hands and knees and crawled toward the dog. This unusual posture again excited suspicion, and the animal sidled mincingly away.  <br><br>  The man sat up in the snow for a moment and struggled for calmness. Then he pulled on his mittens, by means of his teeth, and got upon his feet. He glanced down at first in order to assure himself that he was really standing up, for the absence of sensation in his feet left him unrelated to the earth. His erect position in itself started to drive the webs of suspicion from the dog's mind; and when he spoke peremptorily, with the sound of whip-lashes in his voice, the dog rendered its customary allegiance and came to him. As it came within reaching distance, the man lost his control. His arms flashed out to the dog, and he experienced genuine surprise when he discovered that his hands could not clutch, that there was neither bend nor feeling in the lingers. He had forgotten for the moment that they were frozen and that they were freezing more and more. All this happened quickly, and before the animal could get away, he encircled its body with his arms. He sat down in the snow, and in this fashion held the dog, while it snarled and whined and struggled.  <br><br>  But it was all he could do, hold its body encircled in his arms and sit there. He realized that he could not kill the dog. There was no way to do it. With his helpless hands he could neither draw nor hold his sheath-knife nor throttle the animal. He released it, and it plunged wildly away, with tail between its legs, and still snarling. It halted forty feet away and surveyed him curiously, with ears sharply pricked forward. The man looked down at his hands in order to locate them, and found them hanging on the ends of his arms. It struck him as curious that one should have to use his eyes in order to find out where his hands were. He began threshing his arms back and forth, beating the mittened hands against his sides. He did this for five minutes, violently, and his heart pumped enough blood up to the surface to put a stop to his shivering. But no sensation was aroused in the hands. He had an impression that they hung like weights on the ends of his arms, but when he tried to run the impression down, he could not find it.  <br><br>  A certain fear of death, dull and oppressive, came to him. This fear quickly became poignant as he realized that it was no longer a mere matter of freezing his fingers and toes, or of losing his hands and feet, but that it was a matter of life and death with the chances against him. This threw him into a panic, and he turned and ran up the creek-bed along the old, dim trail. The dog joined in behind and kept up with him. He ran blindly, without intention, in fear such as he had never known in his life. Slowly, as he ploughed and floundered through the snow, he began to see things again--the banks of the creek, the old timber-jams, the leafless aspens, and the sky. The running made him feel better. He did not shiver. Maybe, if he ran on, his feet would thaw out; and, anyway, if he ran far enough, he would reach camp and the boys. Without doubt he would lose some fingers and toes and some of his face; but the boys would take care of him, and save the rest of him when he got there. And at the same time there was another thought in his mind that said he would never get to the camp and the boys; that it was too many miles away, that the freezing had too great a start on him, and that he would soon be stiff and dead. This thought he kept in the background and refused to consider. Sometimes it pushed itself forward and demanded to be heard, but he thrust it back and strove to think of other things.  <br><br>  It struck him as curious that he could run at all on feet so frozen that he could not feel them when they struck the earth and took the weight of his body. He seemed to himself to skim along above the surface and to have no connection with the earth. Somewhere he had once seen a winged Mercury, and he wondered if Mercury felt as he felt when skimming over the earth.  <br><br>  His theory of running until he reached camp and the boys had one flaw in it: he lacked the endurance. Several times he stumbled, and finally he tottered, crumpled up, and fell. When he tried to rise, he failed. He must sit and rest, he decided, and next time he would merely walk and keep on going. As he sat and regained his breath, he noted that he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He was not shivering, and it even seemed that a warm glow had come to his chest and trunk. And yet, when he touched his nose or cheeks, there was no sensation. Running would not thaw them out. Nor would it thaw out his hands and feet. Then the thought came to him that the frozen portions of his body must be extending. He tried to keep this thought down, to forget it, to think of something else; he was aware of the panicky feeling that it caused, and he was afraid of the panic. But the thought asserted itself, and persisted, until it produced a vision of his body totally frozen. This was too much, and he made another wild run along the trail. Once he slowed down to a walk, but the thought of the freezing extending itself made him run again.  <br><br>  And all the time the dog ran with him, at his heels. When he fell down a second time, it curled its tail over its forefeet and sat in front of him facing him curiously eager and intent. The warmth and security of the animal angered him, and he cursed it till it flattened down its ears appeasingly. This time the shivering came more quickly upon the man. He was losing in his battle with the frost. It was creeping into his body from all sides. The thought of it drove him on, but he ran no more than a hundred feet, when he staggered and pitched headlong. It was his last panic. When he had recovered his breath and control, he sat up and entertained in his mind the conception of meeting death with dignity. However, the conception did not come to him in such terms. His idea of it was that he had been making a fool of himself, running around like a chicken with its head cut off--such was the simile that occurred to him. Well, he was bound to freeze anyway, and he might as well take it decently. With this new-found peace of mind came the first glimmerings of drowsiness. A good idea, he thought, to sleep off to death. It was like taking an anaesthetic. Freezing was not so bad as people thought. There were lots worse ways to die.  <br><br>  He pictured the boys finding his body next day. Suddenly he found himself with them, coming along the trail and looking for himself. And, still with them, he came around a turn in the trail and found himself lying in the snow. He did not belong with himself any more, for even then he was out of himself, standing with the boys and looking at himself in the snow. It certainly was cold, was his thought. When he got back to the States he could tell the folks what real cold was. He drifted on from this to a vision of the old-timer on Sulphur Creek. He could see him quite clearly, warm and comfortable, and smoking a pipe.  <br><br>  ""You were right, old hoss; you were right,"" the man mumbled to the old-timer of Sulphur Creek.  <br><br>  Then the man drowsed off into what seemed to him the most comfortable and satisfying sleep he had ever known. The dog sat facing him and waiting. The brief day drew to a close in a long, slow twilight. There were no signs of a fire to be made, and, besides, never in the dog's experience had it known a man to sit like that in the snow and make no fire. As the twilight drew on, its eager yearning for the fire mastered it, and with a great lifting and shifting of forefeet, it whined softly, then flattened its ears down in anticipation of being chidden by the man. But the man remained silent. Later, the dog whined loudly. And still later it crept close to the man and caught the scent of death. This made the animal bristle and back away. A little longer it delayed, howling under the stars that leaped and danced and shone brightly in the cold sky. Then it turned and trotted up the trail in the direction of the camp it knew, where were the other food-providers and fire-providers.                             <br><br>"
46,To Kill a Man,"THOUGH dim night-lights burned, she moved familiarly through  the big rooms and wide halls, seeking vainly the half-finished  book of verse she had mislaid and only now remembered. When she  turned on the lights in the drawing-room, she disclosed herself  clad in a sweeping negligee gown of soft rose-colored stuff,  throat and shoulders smothered in lace. Her rings were still on  her fingers, her massed yellow hair had not yet been taken  down. She was delicately, gracefully beautiful, with slender,  oval face, red lips, a faint color in the cheeks, and blue eyes  of the chameleon sort that at will stare wide with the  innocence of childhood, go hard and gray and brilliantly cold,  or flame up in hot wilfulness and mastery.<br><br>    She turned the lights off and passed out and down the hall  toward the morning room. At the entrance she paused and  listened. From farther on had come, not a noise, but an  impression of movement. She could have sworn she had not heard  anything, yet something had been different. The atmosphere of  night quietude had been disturbed. She wondered what servant  could be prowling about. Not the butler, who was nosion.  torious for retiring early save on special occasion. Nor could  it be her maid, whom she had permitted to go that evening.<br><br>    Passing on to the dining-room, she found the door closed. Why  she opened it and went on in, she did not know, except for the  feeling that the disturbing factor, whatever it might be, was  there. The room was in darkness, and she felt her way to the  button and pressed. As the blaze of light flashed on, she  stepped back and cried out. It was a mere ""Oh!"" and it was not  loud.<br><br>    Facing her, alongside the button, flat against the wall, was a  man. In his hand, pointed toward her, was a revolver. She  noticed, even in the shock of seeing him, that the weapon was  black and exceedingly long-barreled. She knew black and  exceedingly long it for what it was, a Colt's. He was a  medium-sized man, roughly clad, brown-eyed, and swarthy with  sunburn. He seemed very cool. There was no wabble to the  revolver and it was directed toward her stomach, not from an  outstretched arm, but from the hip, against which the forearm  rested. <br><br>    ""Oh,"" she said. ""I beg your pardon. You startled me. What do  you want?""<br><br>    ""I reckon I want to get out,"" he answered, with a humorous  twitch to the lips. ""I've kind of lost my way in this here  shebang, and if you'll kindly show me the door I'll cause no  trouble and sure vamoose.""<br><br>    ""But what are you doing here?"" she demanded, her voice touched  with the sharpness of one used to authority.<br><br>    ""Plain robbing, Miss, that's all. I came snooping around to see  what I could gather up. I thought you wan't to home, seein' as  I saw you pull out with your old man in an auto. I reckon that  must a ben your pa, and you're Miss Setliffe.""<br><br>    Mrs. Setliffe saw his mistake, appreciated the naive  compliment, and decided not to undeceive him.<br><br>    ""How do you know I am Miss Setliffe?"" she asked.<br><br>    ""This is old Setliffe's house, ain't it?""<br><br>    She nodded.<br><br>    ""I didn't know he had a daughter, but I reckon you must be her.  And now, if it ain't botherin' you too much, I'd sure be  obliged if you'd show me the way out.""<br><br>    ""But why should I? You are a robber, a burglar.""<br><br>    ""If I wan't an ornery shorthorn at the business, I'd be  accumulatin' them rings on your fingers instead of being  polite,"" he retorted.<br><br>    ""I come to make a raise outa old Setliffe, and not to be  robbing women-folks. If you get outa the way, I reckon I can  find my own way out.""<br><br>    Mrs. Setliffe was a keen woman, and she felt that from such a  man there was little to fear. That he was not a typical  criminal, she was certain. From his speech she knew he was not  of the cities, and she seemed to sense the wider, homelier air  of large spaces.<br><br>    ""Suppose I screamed?"" she queried curiously. ""Suppose I made an  outcry for help? You couldn't shoot me? . . . a woman?""<br><br>    She noted the fleeting bafflement in his brown eyes. He  answered slowly and thoughtfully, as if working out a difficult  problem. ""I reckon, then, I'd have to choke you and maul you  some bad.""<br><br>    ""A woman?""<br><br>    ""I'd sure have to,"" he answered, and she saw his mouth set  grimly.<br><br>    ""You're only a soft woman, but you see, Miss, I can't afford to  go to jail. No, Miss, I sure can't. There's a friend of mine  waitin' for me out West. He's in a hole, and I've got to help  him out."" The mouth shaped even more grimly. ""I guess I could  choke you without hurting you much to speak of.""<br><br>    Her eyes took on a baby stare of innocent incredulity as she  watched him. <br><br>    ""I never met a burglar before,"" she assured him, ""and I can't  begin to tell you how interested I am.""<br><br>    ""I'm not a burglar, Miss. Not a real one,"" he hastened to add  as she looked her amused unbelief. ""It looks like it, me being  here in your house. But it's the first time I ever tackled such  a job. I needed the money bad. Besides, I kind of look on it  like collecting what's coming to me.""<br><br>    ""I don't understand,"" she smiled encouragingly. ""You came here  to rob, and to rob is to take what is not yours.""<br><br>    ""Yes, and no, in this here particular case. But I reckon I'd  better be going now.""<br><br>    He started for the door of the dining-room, but she interposed,  and a very beautiful obstacle she made of herself. His left  hand went out as if to grip her, then hesitated. He was  patently awed by her soft womanhood.<br><br>    ""There!"" she cried triumphantly. ""I knew you wouldn't.""<br><br>    The man was embarrassed.<br><br>    ""I ain't never manhandled a woman yet,"" he explained, ""and it  don't come easy. But I sure will, if you set to screaming.""<br><br>    ""Won't you stay a few minutes and talk?"" she urged. ""I'm so  interested. I should like to hear you explain how burglary is  collecting what is coming to you.""<br><br>    He looked at her admiringly.<br><br>    ""I always thought women-folks were scairt of robbers,"" he  confessed. ""But you don't seem none.""<br><br>    She laughed gaily.<br><br>    ""There are robbers and robbers, you know. I am not afraid of  you, because I am confident you are not the sort of creature  that would harm a woman. Come, talk with me a while. Nobody  will disturb us. I am all alone. My-- father caught the night  train to New York. The servants are all asleep. I should like  to give you something to eat--women always prepare midnight  suppers for the burglars they catch, at least they do in the  magazine stories. But I don't know where to find the food.  Perhaps you will have something to drink?""<br><br>    He hesitated, and did not reply; but she could see the  admiration for her growing in his eyes.<br><br>    ""You're not afraid?"" she queried. ""I won't poison you, I  promise. I'll drink with you to show you it is all right.""<br><br>    ""You sure are a surprise package of all right,"" he declared,  for the first time lowering the weapon and letting it hang at  his side. ""No one don't need to tell me ever again that  women-folks in cities is afraid. You ain't much--just a little  soft pretty thing. But you've sure got the spunk. And you're  trustful on top of it. There ain't many women, or men either.  who'd treat a man with a gun the way you're treating me.""<br><br>    She smiled her pleasure in the compliment, and her face, was  very earnest as she said:<br><br>    ""That is because I like your appearance. You are too  decent-looking a man to be a robber. You oughtn't to do such  things. If you are in bad luck you should go to work. Come, put  away that nasty revolver and let us talk it over. The thing for  you to do is to work.""<br><br>    ""Not in this burg,"" he commented bitterly. ""I've walked two  inches off the bottom of my legs trying to find a job. Honest,  I was a fine large man once. . . before I started looking for a  job.""<br><br>    The merry laughter with which she greeted his sally obviously  pleased him, and she was quick to note and take advantage of  it. She moved directly away from the door and toward the  sideboard.<br><br>    ""Come, you must tell me all about it while I get that drink for  you. What will it be? Whisky?""<br><br>    ""Yes, ma'am,"" he said, as he followed her, though he still  carried the big revolver at his side, and though he glanced  reluctantly at the unguarded open door.<br><br>    She filled a glass for him at the sideboard.<br><br>    ""I promised to drink with you,"" she said hesitatingly. ""But I  don't like whisky. I . . . I prefer sherry.""<br><br>    She lifted the sherry bottle tentatively for his consent.<br><br>    ""Sure,"" he answered, with a nod. ""Whisky's a man's drink. I  never like to see women at it. Wine's more their stuff.""<br><br>    She raised her glass to his, her eyes meltingly sympathetic.<br><br>    ""Here's to finding you a good position--""<br><br>    But she broke off at sight of the expression of surprised  disgust on his face. The glass, barely touched, was removed  from his wry lips.<br><br>    ""What is the matter!"" she asked anxiously. ""Don't you like it?  Have I made a mistake?""<br><br>    ""It's sure funny whisky. Tastes like it got burned and smoked  in the making.""<br><br>    ""Oh! How silly of me! I gave you Scotch. Of course you are  accustomed to rye. Let me change it.""<br><br>    She was almost solicitiously maternal, as she replaced the  glass with another and sought and found the proper bottle.<br><br>    ""Better?"" she asked.<br><br>    ""Yes, ma'am. No smoke in it. It's sure the real good stuff. I  ain't had a drink in a week. Kind of slick, that; oily, you  know; not made in a chemical factory.""<br><br>    ""You are a drinking man?"" It was half a question, half a  challenge.<br><br>    ""No, ma'am, not to speak of. I HAVE rared up and ripsnorted at  spells, but most unfrequent. But there is times when a good  stiff jolt lands on the right spot kerchunk, and this is sure  one of them. And now, thanking you for your kindness, ma'am,  I'll just be a pulling along.""<br><br>    But Mrs. Setliffe did not want to lose her burglar. She was too  poised a woman to possess much romance, but there was a thrill  about the present situation that delighted her. Besides, she  knew there was no danger. The man, despite his jaw and the  steady brown eyes, was eminently tractable. Also, farther back  in her consciousness glimmered the thought of an audience of  admiring friends. It was too bad not to have that audience.<br><br>    ""You haven't explained how burglary, in your case, is merely  collecting what is your own,"" she said. ""Come, sit down, and  tell me about it here at the table.""<br><br>    She maneuvered for her own seat, and placed him across the  corner from her. His alertness had not deserted him, as she  noted, and his eyes roved sharply about, returning always with  smoldering admiration to hers, but never resting long. And she  noted likewise that while she spoke he was intent on listening  for other sounds than those of her voice. Nor had he  relinquished the revolver, which lay at the corner of the table  between them, the butt close to his right hand.<br><br>    But he was in a new habitat which he did not know. This man  from the West, cunning in woodcraft and plainscraft, with eyes  and ears open, tense and suspicious, did not know that under  the table, close to her foot, was the push button of an  electric bell. He had never heard of such a contrivance, and  his keenness and wariness went for naught.<br><br>    ""It's like this, Miss,"" he began, in response to her urging.  ""Old Setliffe done me up in a little deal once. It was raw, but  it worked. Anything will work full and legal when it's got few  hundred million behind it. I'm not squealin', and I ain't  taking a slam at your pa. He don't know me from Adam, and I  reckon he don't know he done me outa anything. He's too big,  thinking and dealing in millions, to ever hear of a small  potato like me. He's an operator. He's got all kinds of experts  thinking and planning and working for him, some of them, I  hear, getting more cash salary than the President of the United  States. I'm only one of thousands that have been done up by  your pa, that's all.<br><br>    ""You see, ma'am, I had a little hole in the ground--a dinky,  hydraulic, one-horse outfit of a mine. And when the Setliffe  crowd shook down Idaho, and reorganized the smelter trust, and  roped in the rest of the landscape, and put through the big  hydraulic scheme at Twin Pines, why I sure got squeezed. I  never had a run for my money. I was scratched off the card  before the first heat. And so, to-night, being broke and my  friend needing me bad, I just dropped around to make a raise  outa your pa. Seeing as I needed it, it kinda was coming to  me.""<br><br>    ""Granting all that you say is so,"" she said, ""nevertheless it  does not make house-breaking any the less house-breaking. You  couldn't make such a defense in a court of law.""<br><br>    ""I know that,"" he confessed meekly. ""What's right ain't always  legal. And that's why I am so uncomfortable a-settin' here and  talking with you. Not that I ain't enjoying your company--I  sure do enjoy it--but I just can't afford to be caught. I know  what they'd do to me in this here city. There was a young  fellow that got fifty years only last week for holding a man up  on the street for two dollars and eighty-five cents. I read  about it in the paper. When times is hard and they ain't no  work, men get desperate. And then the other men who've got  something to be robbed of get desperate, too, and they just  sure soak it to the other fellows. If I got caught, I reckon I  wouldn't get a mite less than ten years. That's why I'm  hankering to be on my way.""<br><br>    ""No; wait."" She lifted a detaining hand, at the same time  removing her foot from the bell, which she had been pressing  intermittently. ""You haven't told me your name yet.""<br><br>    He hesitated.<br><br>    ""Call me Dave.""<br><br>    ""Then . . . Dave,"" she laughed with pretty confusion.  ""Something must be done for you. You are a young man, and you  are just at the beginning of a bad start. If you begin by  attempting to collect what you think is coming to you, later on  you will be collecting what you are perfectly sure isn't coming  to you. And you know what the end will be. Instead of this, we  must find something honorable for you to do.""<br><br>    ""I need the money, and I need it now,"" he replied doggedly.  ""It's not for myself, but for that friend I told you about.  He's in a peck of trouble, and he's got to get his lift now or  not at all.""<br><br>    ""I can find you a position,"" she said quickly. ""And--yes, the  very thing!--I'll lend you the money you want to send to your  friend. This you can pay back out of your salary.""<br><br>    ""About three hundred would do,"" he said slowly. ""Three hundred  would pull him through. I'd work my fingers off for a year for  that, and my keep, and a few cents to buy Bull Durham with.""<br><br>    ""Ah! You smoke! I never thought of it.""<br><br>    Her hand went out over the revolver toward his hand, as she  pointed to the tell-tale yellow stain on his fingers. At the  same time her eyes measured the nearness of her own hand and of  his to the weapon. She ached to grip it in one swift movement.  She was sure she could do it, and yet she was not sure; and so  it was that she refrained as she withdrew her hand.<br><br>    ""Won't you smoke?"" she invited.<br><br>    ""I'm 'most dying to.""<br><br>    ""Then do so. I don't mind. I really like it--cigarettes, I  mean.""<br><br>    With his left band he dipped into his side pocket, brought out  a loose wheat-straw paper and shifted it to his right hand  close by the revolver. Again he dipped, transferring to the  paper a pinch of brown, flaky tobacco. Then he proceeded, both  hands just over the revolver, to roll the cigarette.<br><br>    ""From the way you hover close to that nasty weapon, you seem to  be afraid of me,"" she challenged.<br><br>    ""Not exactly afraid of you, ma'am, but, under the  circumstances, just a mite timid.""<br><br>    ""But I've not been afraid of you.""<br><br>    ""You've got nothing to lose.""<br><br>    ""My life,"" she retorted.<br><br>    ""That's right,"" he acknowledged promptly, ""and you ain't been  scairt of me. Mebbe I am over anxious.""<br><br>    ""I wouldn't cause you any harm.""<br><br>    Even as she spoke, her slipper felt for the bell and pressed  it. At the same time her eyes were earnest with a plea of  honesty.<br><br>    ""You are a judge of men. I know it. And of women. Surely, when  I am trying to persuade you from a criminal life and to get you  honest work to do . . . .?""<br><br>    He was immediately contrite.<br><br>    ""I sure beg your pardon, ma'am,"" he said. ""I reckon my  nervousness ain't complimentary.""<br><br>    As he spoke, he drew his right hand from the table, and after  lighting the cigarette, dropped it by his side.<br><br>    ""Thank you for your confidence,"" she breathed softly,  resolutely keeping her eyes from measuring the distance to the  revolver, and keeping her foot pressed firmly on the bell.<br><br>    ""About that three hundred,"" he began. ""I can telegraph it West  to-night. And I'll agree to work a year for it and my keep.""<br><br>    ""You will earn more than that. I can promise seventy-five  dollars a month at the least. Do you know horses?""<br><br>    His face lighted up and his eyes sparkled.<br><br>    ""Then go to work for me--or for my father, rather, though I  engage all the servants. I need a second coachman--""<br><br>    ""And wear a uniform?"" he interrupted sharply, the sneer of the  free-born West in his voice and on his lips.<br><br>    She smiled tolerantly.<br><br>    ""Evidently that won't do. Let me think. Yes. Can you break and  handle colts?""<br><br>    He nodded.<br><br>    ""We have a stock farm, and there's room for just such a man as  you. Will you take it?""<br><br>    ""Will I, ma'am?"" His voice was rich with gratitude and  enthusiasm. ""Show me to it. I'll dig right in to-morrow. And I  can sure promise you one thing, ma'am. You'll never be sorry  for lending Hughie Luke a hand in his trouble--""<br><br>    ""I thought you said to call you Dave,"" she chided forgivingly.<br><br>    ""I did, ma'am. I did. And I sure beg your pardon. It was just  plain bluff. My real name is Hughie Luke. And if you'll give me  the address of that stock farm of yours, and the railroad fare,  I head for it first thing in the morning.""<br><br>    Throughout the conversation she had never relaxed her attempts  on the bell. She had pressed it in every alarming way--three  shorts and a long, two and a long, and five. She had tried long  series of shorts, and, once, she had held the button down for a  solid three minutes. And she had been divided between  objurgation of the stupid, heavy-sleeping butler and doubt if  the bell were in order.<br><br>    ""I am so glad,"" she said; ""so glad that you are willing. There  won't be much to arrange. But you will first have to trust me  while I go upstairs for my purse.""<br><br>    She saw the doubt flicker momentarily in his eyes, and added  hastily, ""But you see I am trusting you with the three hundred  dollars.""<br><br>    ""I believe you, ma'am,"" he came back gallantly. ""Though I just  can't help this nervousness.""<br><br>    ""Shall I go and get it?""<br><br>    But before she could receive consent, a slight muffled jar from  the distance came to her ear. She knew it for the swing-door of  the butler's pantry. But so slight was it--more a faint  vibration than a sound--that she would not have heard had not  her ears been keyed and listening for it. Yet the man had  heard. He was startled in his composed way.<br><br>    ""What was that?"" he demanded.<br><br>    For answer, her left hand flashed out to the revolver and  brought it back. She had had the start of him, and she needed  it, for the next instant his hand leaped up from his side,  clutching emptiness where the revolver had been.<br><br>    ""Sit down!"" she commanded sharply, in a voice new to him.  ""Don't move. Keep your hands on the table.""<br><br>    She had taken a lesson from him. Instead of holding the heavy  weapon extended, the butt of it and her forearm rested on the  table, the muzzle pointed, not at his head, but his chest. And  he, looking coolly and obeying her commands, knew there was no  chance of the kick-up of the recoil producing a miss. Also, he  saw that the revolver did not wabble, nor the hand shake, and  he was thoroughly conversant with the size of hole the  soft-nosed bullets could make. He had eyes, not for her, but  for the hammer, which had risen under the pressure of her  forefinger on the trigger.<br><br>    ""I reckon I'd best warn you that that there trigger-pull is  filed dreadful fine. Don't press too hard, or I'll have a hole  in me the size of a walnut.""<br><br>    She slacked the hammer partly down.<br><br>    ""That's better,"" he commented. ""You'd best put it down all the  way. You see how easy it works. If you want to, a quick light  pull will jiffy her up and back and make a pretty mess all over  your nice floor.""<br><br>    A door opened behind him, and he heard somebody enter the room.  But he did not turn his bead. He was looking at her, and he  found it the face of another woman--hard, cold, pitiless yet  brilliant in its beauty. The eyes, too, were hard, though  blazing with a cold light.<br><br>    ""Thomas,"" she commanded, ""go to the telephone and call the  police. Why were you so long in answering?""<br><br>    ""I came as soon as I heard the bell, madam,"" was the answer.<br><br>    The robber never took his eyes from hers, nor did she from his,  but at mention of the bell she noticed that his eyes were  puzzled for the moment.<br><br>    ""Beg your pardon,"" said the butler from behind, ""but wouldn't  it be better for me to get a weapon and arouse the servants?""<br><br>    ""No; ring for the police. I can hold this man. Go and do  it--quickly.""<br><br>    The butler slippered out of the room, and the man and the woman  sat on, gazing into each other's eyes. To her it was an  experience keen with enjoyment, and in her mind was the gossip  of her crowd, and she saw notes in the society weeklies of the  beautiful young Mrs. Setliffe capturing an armed robber  single-handed. It would create a sensation, she was sure.<br><br>    ""When you get that sentence you mentioned,"" she said coldly,  ""you will have time to meditate upon what a fool you have been,  taking other persons' property and threatening women with  revolvers. You will have time to learn your lesson thoroughly.  Now tell the truth. You haven't any friend in trouble. All that  you told me was lies.""<br><br>    He did not reply. Though his eyes were upon her, they seemed  blank. In truth, for the instant she was veiled to him, and  what he saw was the wide sunwashed spaces of the West, where  men and women were bigger than the rotten denizens, as he had  encountered them, of the thrice rotten cities of the East.<br><br>    ""Go on. Why don't you speak? Why don't you lie some more? Why  don't you beg to be let off?""<br><br>    ""I might,"" he answered, licking his dry lips. ""I might ask to  be let off if . . . ""<br><br>    ""If what?"" she demanded peremptorily, as he paused.<br><br>    ""I was trying to think of a word you reminded me of. As I was  saying, I might if you was a decent woman.""<br><br>    Her face paled.<br><br>    ""Be careful,"" she warned.<br><br>    ""You don't dast kill me,"" he sneered. ""The world's a pretty low  down place to have a thing like you prowling around in it, but  it ain't so plumb low down, I reckon, as to let you put a hole  in me. You're sure bad, but the trouble with you is that you're  weak in your badness. It ain't much to kill a man, but you  ain't got it in you. There's where you lose out.""<br><br>    ""Be careful of what you say,"" she repeated. ""Or else, I warn  you, it will go hard with you. It can be seen to whether your  sentence is light or heavy.""<br><br>    ""Something's the matter with God,"" he remarked irrelevantly,  ""to be letting you around loose. It's clean beyond me what he's  up to, playing such-like tricks on poor humanity. Now if I was  God--""<br><br>    His further opinion was interrupted by the entrance of the  butler.<br><br>    ""Something is wrong with the telephone, madam,"" he announced.  ""The wires are crossed or something, because I can't get  Central.""<br><br>    ""Go and call one of the servants,"" she ordered. ""Send him out  for an officer, and then return here.""<br><br>    Again the pair was left alone.<br><br>    ""Will you kindly answer one question, ma'am?"" the man said.  ""That servant fellow said something about a bell. I watched you  like a cat, and you sure rung no bell.""<br><br>    ""It was under the table, you poor fool. I pressed it with my  foot.""<br><br>    ""Thank you, ma'am. I reckoned I'd seen your kind before, and  now I sure know I have. I spoke to you true and trusting, and  all the time you was lying like hell to me.""<br><br>    She laughed mockingly.<br><br>    ""Go on. Say what you wish. It is very interesting.""<br><br>    ""You made eyes at me, looking soft and kind, playing up all the  time the fact that you wore skirts instead of pants--and all  the time with your foot on the bell under the table. Well,  there's some consolation. I'd sooner be poor Hughie Luke, doing  his ten years, than be in your skin. Ma'am, hell is full of  women like you.""<br><br>    There was silence for a space, in which the man, never taking  his eyes from her, studying her, was making up his mind.<br><br>    ""Go on,"" she urged. ""Say something.""<br><br>    ""Yes, ma'am, I'll say something. I'll sure say something. Do  you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to get right up from  this chair and walk out that door. I'd take the gun from you,  only you might turn foolish and let it go off. You can have the  gun. It's a good one. As I was saying, I am going right out  that door. And you ain't going to pull that gun off either. It  takes guts to shoot a man, and you sure ain't got them. Now get  ready and see if you can pull that trigger. I ain't going to  harm you. I'm going out that door, and I'm starting.""<br><br>    Keeping his eyes fixed on her, he pushed back the chair and  slowly stood erect. The hammer rose halfway. She watched it. So  did he.<br><br>    ""Pull harder,"" he advised. ""It ain't half up yet. Go on and  pull it and kill a man. That's what I said, kill a man, spatter  his brains out on the floor, or slap a hole into him the size  of your. fist. That's what killing a man means.""<br><br>    The hammer lowered jerkily but gently. The man turned his back  and walked slowly to the door. She swung the revolver around so  that it bore on his back. Twice again the hammer came up  halfway and was reluctantly eased down.<br><br>    At the door the man turned for a moment before passing on. A  sneer was on his lips. He spoke to her in a low voice, almost  drawling, but in it was the quintessence of all loathing, as he  called her a name unspeakable and vile.  						                                      <br><br>"
47,Too Much Gold,"This being a story--and a truer one than it may appear--of a mining country, it is quite to be expected that it will be a hard-luck story.  But that depends on the point of view.  Hard luck is a mild way of terming it so far as Kink Mitchell and Hootchinoo Bill are concerned; and that they have a decided opinion on the subject is a matter of common knowledge in the Yukon country.  <br><br>It was in the fall of 1896 that the two partners came down to the east bank of the Yukon, and drew a Peterborough canoe from a moss- covered cache.  They were not particularly pleasant-looking objects.  A summer's prospecting, filled to repletion with hardship and rather empty of grub, had left their clothes in tatters and themselves worn and cadaverous.  A nimbus of mosquitoes buzzed about each man's head.  Their faces were coated with blue clay. Each carried a lump of this damp clay, and, whenever it dried and fell from their faces, more was daubed on in its place.  There was a querulous plaint in their voices, an irritability of movement and gesture, that told of broken sleep and a losing struggle with the little winged pests.   <br><br>""Them skeeters'll be the death of me yet,"" Kink Mitchell whimpered, as the canoe felt the current on her nose, and leaped out from the bank  <br><br>""Cheer up, cheer up.  We're about done,"" Hootchinoo Bill answered, with an attempted heartiness in his funereal tones that was ghastly.  ""We'll be in Forty Mile in forty minutes, and then-- cursed little devil!""   <br><br>One hand left his paddle and landed on the back of his neck with a sharp slap.  He put a fresh daub of clay on the injured part, swearing sulphurously the while.  Kink Mitchell was not in the least amused.  He merely improved the opportunity by putting a thicker coating of clay on his own neck.  <br><br>They crossed the Yukon to its west bank, shot down-stream with easy stroke, and at the end of forty minutes swung in close to the left around the tail of an island.  Forty Mile spread itself suddenly before them.  Both men straightened their backs and gazed at the sight.  They gazed long and carefully, drifting with the current, in their faces an expression of mingled surprise and consternation slowly gathering.  Not a thread of smoke was rising from the hundreds of log-cabins.  There was no sound of axes biting sharply into wood, of hammering and sawing.  Neither dogs nor men loitered before the big store.  No steamboats lay at the bank, no canoes, nor scows, nor poling-boats.  The river was as bare of craft as the town was of life.   <br><br>""Kind of looks like Gabriel's tooted his little horn, and you an' me has turned up missing,"" remarked Hootchinoo Bill.  <br><br>His remark was casual, as though there was nothing unusual about the occurrence.  Kink Mitchell's reply was just as casual as though he, too, were unaware of any strange perturbation of spirit.   <br><br>""Looks as they was all Baptists, then, and took the boats to go by water,"" was his contribution.  <br><br>""My ol' dad was a Baptist,"" Hootchinoo Bill supplemented.  ""An' he always did hold it was forty thousand miles nearer that way.""   <br><br>This was the end of their levity.  They ran the canoe in and climbed the high earth bank.  A feeling of awe descended upon them as they walked the deserted streets.  The sunlight streamed placidly over the town.  A gentle wind tapped the halyards against the flagpole before the closed doors of the Caledonia Dance Hall. Mosquitoes buzzed, robins sang, and moose birds tripped hungrily among the cabins; but there was no human life nor sign of human life.  <br><br>""I'm just dyin' for a drink,"" Hootchinoo Bill said and unconsciously his voice sank to a hoarse whisper.   <br><br>His partner nodded his head, loth to hear his own voice break the stillness.  They trudged on in uneasy silence till surprised by an open door.  Above this door, and stretching the width of the building, a rude sign announced the same as the ""Monte Carlo.""  But beside the door, hat over eyes, chair tilted back, a man sat sunning himself.  He was an old man.  Beard and hair were long and white and patriarchal.  <br><br>""If it ain't ol' Jim Cummings, turned up like us, too late for Resurrection!"" said Kink Mitchell.   <br><br>""Most like he didn't hear Gabriel tootin',"" was Hootchinoo Bill's suggestion.  <br><br>""Hello, Jim!  Wake up!"" he shouted.   <br><br>The old man unlimbered lamely, blinking his eyes and murmuring automatically:  ""What'll ye have, gents?  What'll ye have?""  <br><br>They followed him inside and ranged up against the long bar where of yore a half-dozen nimble bar-keepers found little time to loaf. The great room, ordinarily aroar with life, was still and gloomy as a tomb.  There was no rattling of chips, no whirring of ivory balls.  Roulette and faro tables were like gravestones under their canvas covers.  No women's voices drifted merrily from the dance- room behind.  Ol' Jim Cummings wiped a glass with palsied hands, and Kink Mitchell scrawled his initials on the dust-covered bar.   <br><br>""Where's the girls?"" Hootchinoo Bill shouted, with affected geniality.  <br><br>""Gone,"" was the ancient bar-keeper's reply, in a voice thin and aged as himself, and as unsteady as his hand.   <br><br>""Where's Bidwell and Barlow?""  <br><br>""Gone.""   <br><br>""And Sweetwater Charley?""  <br><br>""Gone.""   <br><br>""And his sister?""  <br><br>""Gone too.""   <br><br>""Your daughter Sally, then, and her little kid?""  <br><br>""Gone, all gone.""  The old man shook his head sadly, rummaging in an absent way among the dusty bottles.   <br><br>""Great Sardanapolis!  Where?"" Kink Mitchell exploded, unable longer to restrain himself.  ""You don't say you've had the plague?""  <br><br>""Why, ain't you heerd?""  The old man chuckled quietly.  ""They-all's gone to Dawson.""   <br><br>""What-like is that?"" Bill demanded.  ""A creek? or a bar? or a place?""  <br><br>""Ain't never heered of Dawson, eh?""  The old man chuckled exasperatingly.  ""Why, Dawson's a town, a city, bigger'n Forty Mile.  Yes, sir, bigger'n Forty Mile.""   <br><br>""I've ben in this land seven year,"" Bill announced emphatically, ""an' I make free to say I never heard tell of the burg before. Hold on!  Let's have some more of that whisky.  Your information's flabbergasted me, that it has.  Now just whereabouts is this Dawson-place you was a-mentionin'?""  <br><br>""On the big flat jest below the mouth of Klondike,"" ol' Jim answered.  ""But where has you-all ben this summer?""   <br><br>""Never you mind where we-all's ben,"" was Kink Mitchell's testy reply.  ""We-all's ben where the skeeters is that thick you've got to throw a stick into the air so as to see the sun and tell the time of day.  Ain't I right, Bill?""  <br><br>""Right you are,"" said Bill.  ""But speakin' of this Dawson-place how like did it happen to be, Jim?""   <br><br>""Ounce to the pan on a creek called Bonanza, an' they ain't got to bed-rock yet.""  <br><br>""Who struck it?""   <br><br>""Carmack.""  <br><br>At mention of the discoverer's name the partners stared at each other disgustedly.  Then they winked with great solemnity.   <br><br>""Siwash George,"" sniffed Hootchinoo Bill.  <br><br>""That squaw-man,"" sneered Kink Mitchell.   <br><br>""I wouldn't put on my moccasins to stampede after anything he'd ever find,"" said Bill.  <br><br>""Same here,"" announced his partner.  ""A cuss that's too plumb lazy to fish his own salmon.  That's why he took up with the Indians. S'pose that black brother-in-law of his,--lemme see, Skookum Jim, eh?--s'pose he's in on it?""   <br><br>The old bar-keeper nodded.  ""Sure, an' what's more, all Forty Mile, exceptin' me an' a few cripples.""  <br><br>""And drunks,"" added Kink Mitchell.   <br><br>""No-sir-ee!"" the old man shouted emphatically.  <br><br>""I bet you the drinks Honkins ain't in on it!"" Hootchinoo Bill cried with certitude.   <br><br>Ol' Jim's face lighted up.  ""I takes you, Bill, an' you loses.""  <br><br>""However did that ol' soak budge out of Forty Mile?"" Mitchell demanded.   <br><br>""The ties him down an' throws him in the bottom of a polin'-boat,"" ol' Jim explained.  ""Come right in here, they did, an' takes him out of that there chair there in the corner, an' three more drunks they finds under the pianny.  I tell you-alls the whole camp hits up the Yukon for Dawson jes' like Sam Scratch was after them,-- wimmen, children, babes in arms, the whole shebang.  Bidwell comes to me an' sez, sez he, 'Jim, I wants you to keep tab on the Monte Carlo.  I'm goin'.'  <br><br>""'Where's Barlow?' sez I.  'Gone,' sez he, 'an' I'm a-followin' with a load of whisky.'  An' with that, never waitin' for me to decline, he makes a run for his boat an' away he goes, polin' up river like mad.  So here I be, an' these is the first drinks I've passed out in three days.""   <br><br>The partners looked at each other.  <br><br>""Gosh darn my buttoms!"" said Hootchinoo Bill.  ""Seems likes you and me, Kink, is the kind of folks always caught out with forks when it rains soup.""   <br><br>""Wouldn't it take the saleratus out your dough, now?"" said Kink Mitchell.  ""A stampede of tin-horns, drunks, an' loafers.""  <br><br>""An' squaw-men,"" added Bill.  ""Not a genooine miner in the whole caboodle.""   <br><br>""Genooine miners like you an' me, Kink,"" he went on academically, ""is all out an' sweatin' hard over Birch Creek way.  Not a genooine miner in this whole crazy Dawson outfit, and I say right here, not a step do I budge for any Carmack strike.  I've got to see the colour of the dust first.""  <br><br>""Same here,"" Mitchell agreed.  ""Let's have another drink.""   <br><br>Having wet this resolution, they beached the canoe, transferred its contents to their cabin, and cooked dinner.  But as the afternoon wore along they grew restive.  They were men used to the silence of the great wilderness, but this gravelike silence of a town worried them.  They caught themselves listening for familiar sounds-- ""waitin' for something to make a noise which ain't goin' to make a noise,"" as Bill put it.  They strolled through the deserted streets to the Monte Carlo for more drinks, and wandered along the river bank to the steamer landing, where only water gurgled as the eddy filled and emptied, and an occasional salmon leapt flashing into the sun.  <br><br>They sat down in the shade in front of the store and talked with the consumptive storekeeper, whose liability to hemorrhage accounted for his presence.  Bill and Kink told him how they intended loafing in their cabin and resting up after the hard summer's work.  They told him, with a certain insistence, that was half appeal for belief, half challenge for contradiction, how much they were going to enjoy their idleness.  But the storekeeper was uninterested.  He switched the conversation back to the strike on Klondike, and they could not keep him away from it.  He could think of nothing else, talk of nothing else, till Hootchinoo Bill rose up in anger and disgust.   <br><br>""Gosh darn Dawson, say I!"" he cried.  <br><br>""Same here,"" said Kink Mitchell, with a brightening face.  ""One'd think something was doin' up there, 'stead of bein' a mere stampede of greenhorns an' tinhorns.""   <br><br>But a boat came into view from downstream.  It was long and slim. It hugged the bank closely, and its three occupants, standing upright, propelled it against the stiff current by means of long poles.  <br><br>""Circle City outfit,"" said the storekeeper.  ""I was lookin' for 'em along by afternoon.  Forty Mile had the start of them by a hundred and seventy miles.  But gee! they ain't losin' any time!""   <br><br>'We'll just sit here quiet-like and watch 'em string by,"" Bill said complacently.  <br><br>As he spoke, another boat appeared in sight, followed after a brief interval by two others.  By this time the first boat was abreast of the men on the bank.  Its occupants did not cease poling while greetings were exchanged, and, though its progress was slow, a half-hour saw it out of sight up river.   <br><br>Still they came from below, boat after boat, in endless procession. The uneasiness of Bill and Kink increased.  They stole speculative, tentative glances at each other, and when their eyes met looked away in embarrassment.  Finally, however, their eyes met and neither looked away.  <br><br>Kink opened his mouth to speak, but words failed him and his mouth remained open while he continued to gaze at his partner.   <br><br>""Just what I was thinken', Kink,"" said Bill.  <br><br>They grinned sheepishly at each other, and by tacit consent started to walk away.  Their pace quickened, and by the time they arrived at their cabin they were on the run.   <br><br>""Can't lose no time with all that multitude a-rushin' by,"" Kink spluttered, as he jabbed the sour-dough can into the beanpot with one hand and with the other gathered in the frying-pan and coffee- pot.  <br><br>""Should say not,"" gasped Bill, his head and shoulders buried in a clothes-sack wherein were stored winter socks and underwear.  ""I say, Kink, don't forget the saleratus on the corner shelf back of the stove.""   <br><br>Half-an-hour later they were launching the canoe and loading up, while the storekeeper made jocular remarks about poor, weak mortals and the contagiousness of ""stampedin' fever.""  But when Bill and Kink thrust their long poles to bottom and started the canoe against the current, he called after them:-  <br><br>""Well, so-long and good luck!  And don't forget to blaze a stake or two for me!""   <br><br>They nodded their heads vigorously and felt sorry for the poor wretch who remained perforce behind.  <pre> * * * * *</pre>   <br><br>Kink and Bill were sweating hard.  According to the revised Northland Scripture, the stampede is to the swift, the blazing of stakes to the strong, and the Crown in royalties, gathers to itself the fulness thereof.  Kink and Bill were both swift and strong. They took the soggy trail at a long, swinging gait that broke the hearts of a couple of tender-feet who tried to keep up with them. Behind, strung out between them and Dawson (where the boats were discarded and land travel began), was the vanguard of the Circle City outfit.  In the race from Forty Mile the partners had passed every boat, winning from the leading boat by a length in the Dawson eddy, and leaving its occupants sadly behind the moment their feet struck the trail.  <br><br>""Huh! couldn't see us for smoke,"" Hootchinoo Bill chuckled, flirting the stinging sweat from his brow and glancing swiftly back along the way they had come.   <br><br>Three men emerged from where the trail broke through the trees. Two followed close at their heels, and then a man and a woman shot into view.  <br><br>""Come on, you Kink!  Hit her up!  Hit her up!""   <br><br>Bill quickened his pace.  Mitchell glanced back in more leisurely fashion.  <br><br>""I declare if they ain't lopin'!""   <br><br>""And here's one that's loped himself out,"" said Bill, pointing to the side of the trail.  <br><br>A man was lying on his back panting in the culminating stages of violent exhaustion.  His face was ghastly, his eyes bloodshot and glazed, for all the world like a dying man.   <br><br>""CHECHAQUO!"" Kink Mitchell grunted, and it was the grunt of the old ""sour dough"" for the green-horn, for the man who outfitted with ""self-risin'"" flour and used baking-powder in his biscuits.  <br><br>The partners, true to the old-timer custom, had intended to stake down-stream from the strike, but when they saw claim 81 BELOW blazed on a tree,--which meant fully eight miles below Discovery,-- they changed their minds.  The eight miles were covered in less than two hours.  It was a killing pace, over so rough trail, and they passed scores of exhausted men that had fallen by the wayside.   <br><br>At Discovery little was to be learned of the upper creek. Cormack's Indian brother-in-law, Skookum Jim, had a hazy notion that the creek was staked as high as the 30's; but when Kink and Bill looked at the corner-stakes of 79 ABOVE, they threw their stampeding packs off their backs and sat down to smoke.  All their efforts had been vain.  Bonanza was staked from mouth to source,-- ""out of sight and across the next divide.""  Bill complained that night as they fried their bacon and boiled their coffee over Cormack's fire at Discovery.  <br><br>""Try that pup,"" Carmack suggested next morning.   <br><br>""That pup"" was a broad creek that flowed into Bonanza at 7 ABOVE. The partners received his advice with the magnificent contempt of the sour dough for a squaw-man, and, instead, spent the day on Adam's Creek, another and more likely-looking tributary of Bonanza. But it was the old story over again--staked to the sky-line.  <br><br>For threes days Carmack repeated his advice, and for three days they received it contemptuously.  But on the fourth day, there being nowhere else to go, they went up ""that pup.""  They knew that it was practically unstaked, but they had no intention of staking. The trip was made more for the purpose of giving vent to their ill- humour than for anything else.  They had become quite cynical, sceptical.  They jeered and scoffed at everything, and insulted every chechaquo they met along the way.   <br><br>At No. 23 the stakes ceased.  The remainder of the creek was open for location.  <br><br>""Moose pasture,"" sneered Kink Mitchell.   <br><br>But Bill gravely paced off five hundred feet up the creek and blazed the corner-stakes.  He had picked up the bottom of a candle- box, and on the smooth side he wrote the notice for his centre- stake:-  <pre> THIS MOOSE PASTURE IS RESERVED FOR THE SWEDES AND CHECHAQUOS. - BILL RADER.</pre>   <br><br>Kink read it over with approval, saying:-  <br><br>""As them's my sentiments, I reckon I might as well subscribe.""   <br><br>So the name of Charles Mitchell was added to the notice; and many an old sour dough's face relaxed that day at sight of the handiwork of a kindred spirit.  <br><br>""How's the pup?"" Carmack inquired when they strolled back into camp.   <br><br>""To hell with pups!"" was Hootchinoo Bill's reply.  ""Me and Kink's goin' a-lookin' for Too Much Gold when we get rested up.""  <br><br>Too Much Gold was the fabled creek of which all sour doughs dreamed, whereof it was said the gold was so thick that, in order to wash it, gravel must first be shovelled into the sluice-boxes. But the several days' rest, preliminary to the quest for Too Much Gold, brought a slight change in their plan, inasmuch as it brought one Ans Handerson, a Swede.   <br><br>Ans Handerson had been working for wages all summer at Miller Creek over on the Sixty Mile, and, the summer done, had strayed up Bonanza like many another waif helplessly adrift on the gold tides that swept willy-nilly across the land.  He was tall and lanky. His arms were long, like prehistoric man's, and his hands were like soup-plates, twisted and gnarled, and big-knuckled from toil.  He was slow of utterance and movement, and his eyes, pale blue as his hair was pale yellow, seemed filled with an immortal dreaming, the stuff of which no man knew, and himself least of all.  Perhaps this appearance of immortal dreaming was due to a supreme and vacuous innocence.  At any rate, this was the valuation men of ordinary clay put upon him, and there was nothing extraordinary about the composition of Hootchinoo Bill and Kink Mitchell.  <br><br>The partners had spent a day of visiting and gossip, and in the evening met in the temporary quarters of the Monte Carlo--a large tent were stampeders rested their weary bones and bad whisky sold at a dollar a drink.  Since the only money in circulation was dust, and since the house took the ""down-weight"" on the scales, a drink cost something more than a dollar.  Bill and Kink were not drinking, principally for the reason that their one and common sack was not strong enough to stand many excursions to the scales.   <br><br>""Say, Bill, I've got a chechaquo on the string for a sack of flour,"" Mitchell announced jubilantly.  <br><br>Bill looked interested and pleased.  Grub as scarce, and they were not over-plentifully supplied for the quest after Too Much Gold.   <br><br>""Flour's worth a dollar a pound,"" he answered.  ""How like do you calculate to get your finger on it?""  <br><br>""Trade 'm a half-interest in that claim of ourn,"" Kink answered.   <br><br>""What claim?"" Bill was surprised.  Then he remembered the reservation he had staked off for the Swedes, and said, ""Oh!""  <br><br>""I wouldn't be so clost about it, though,"" he added.  ""Give 'm the whole thing while you're about it, in a right free-handed way.""   <br><br>Bill shook his head.  ""If I did, he'd get clean scairt and prance off.  I'm lettin' on as how the ground is believed to be valuable, an' that we're lettin' go half just because we're monstrous short on grub.  After the dicker we can make him a present of the whole shebang.""  <br><br>""If somebody ain't disregarded our notice,"" Bill objected, though he was plainly pleased at the prospect of exchanging the claim for a sack of flour.   <br><br>""She ain't jumped,"" Kink assured him.  ""It's No. 24, and it stands. The chechaquos took it serious, and they begun stakin' where you left off.  Staked clean over the divide, too.  I was gassin' with one of them which has just got in with cramps in his legs.""  <br><br>It was then, and for the first time, that they heard the slow and groping utterance of Ans Handerson.   <br><br>""Ay like the looks,"" he was saying to the bar-keeper.  ""Ay tank Ay gat a claim.""  <br><br>The partners winked at each other, and a few minutes later a surprised and grateful Swede was drinking bad whisky with two hard- hearted strangers.  But he was as hard-headed as they were hard- hearted.  The sack made frequent journeys to the scales, followed solicitously each time by Kink Mitchell's eyes, and still Ans Handerson did not loosen up.  In his pale blue eyes, as in summer seas, immortal dreams swam up and burned, but the swimming and the burning were due to the tales of gold and prospect pans he heard, rather than to the whisky he slid so easily down his throat.   <br><br>The  partners were in despair, though they appeared boisterous and jovial of speech and action.  <br><br>""Don't mind me, my friend,"" Hootchinoo Bill hiccoughed, his hand upon Ans Handerson's shoulder.  ""Have another drink.  We're just celebratin' Kink's birthday here.  This is my pardner, Kink, Kink Mitchell.  An' what might your name be?""   <br><br>This learned, his hand descended resoundingly on Kink's back, and Kink simulated clumsy self-consciousness in that he was for the time being the centre of the rejoicing, while Ans Handerson looked pleased and asked them to have a drink with him.  It was the first and last time he treated, until the play changed and his canny soul was roused to unwonted prodigality.  But he paid for the liquor from a fairly healthy-looking sack.  ""Not less 'n eight hundred in it,"" calculated the lynx-eyed Kink; and on the strength of it he took the first opportunity of a privy conversation with Bidwell, proprietor of the bad whisky and the tent.  <br><br>""Here's my sack, Bidwell,"" Kink said, with the intimacy and surety of one old-timer to another.  ""Just weigh fifty dollars into it for a day or so more or less, and we'll be yours truly, Bill an' me.""   <br><br>Thereafter the journeys of the sack to the scales were more frequent, and the celebration of Kink's natal day waxed hilarious. He even essayed to sing the old-timer's classic, ""The Juice of the Forbidden Fruit,"" but broke down and drowned his embarrassment in another round of drinks.  Even Bidwell honoured him with a round or two on the house; and he and Bill were decently drunk by the time Ans Handerson's eyelids began to droop and his tongue gave promise of loosening.  <br><br>Bill grew affectionate, then confidential.  He told his troubles and hard luck to the bar-keeper and the world in general, and to Ans Handerson in particular.  He required no histrionic powers to act the part.  The bad whisky attended to that.  He worked himself into a great sorrow for himself and Bill, and his tears were sincere when he told how he and his partner were thinking of selling a half-interest in good ground just because they were short of grub.  Even Kink listened and believed.   <br><br>Ans Handerson's eyes were shining unholily as he asked, ""How much you tank you take?""  <br><br>Bill and Kink did not hear him, and he was compelled to repeat his query.  They appeared reluctant.  He grew keener.  And he swayed back and forward, holding on to the bar and listened with all his ears while they conferred together on one side, and wrangled as to whether they should or not, and disagreed in stage whispers over the price they should set.   <br><br>""Two hundred and--hic!--fifty,"" Bill finally announced, ""but we reckon as we won't sell.""  <br><br>""Which is monstrous wise if I might chip in my little say,"" seconded Bidwell.   <br><br>""Yes, indeedy,"" added Kink.  ""We ain't in no charity business a- disgorgin' free an' generous to Swedes an' white men.""  <br><br>""Ay tank we haf another drink,"" hiccoughed Ans Handerson, craftily changing the subject against a more propitious time.   <br><br>And thereafter, to bring about that propitious time, his own sack began to see-saw between his hip pocket and the scales.  Bill and Kink were coy, but they finally yielded to his blandishments. Whereupon he grew shy and drew Bidwell to one side.  He staggered exceedingly, and held on to Bidwell for support as he asked -  <br><br>""They ban all right, them men, you tank so?""   <br><br>""Sure,"" Bidwell answered heartily.  ""Known 'em for years.  Old sour doughs.  When they sell a claim, they sell a claim.  They ain't no air-dealers.""  <br><br>""Ay tank Ay buy,"" Ans Handerson announced, tottering back to the two men.   <br><br>But by now he was dreaming deeply, and he proclaimed he would have the whole claim or nothing.  This was the cause of great pain to Hootchinoo Bill.  He orated grandly against the ""hawgishness"" of chechaquos and Swedes, albeit he dozed between periods, his voice dying away to a gurgle, and his head sinking forward on his breast. But whenever roused by a nudge from Kink or Bidwell, he never failed to explode another volley of abuse and insult.  <br><br>Ans Handerson was calm under it all.  Each insult added to the value of the claim.  Such unamiable reluctance to sell advertised but one thing to him, and he was aware of a great relief when Hootchinoo Bill sank snoring to the floor, and he was free to turn his attention to his less intractable partner.   <br><br>Kink Mitchell was persuadable, though a poor mathematician.  He wept dolefully, but was willing to sell a half-interest for two hundred and fifty dollars or the whole claim for seven hundred and fifty.  Ans Handerson and Bidwell laboured to clear away his erroneous ideas concerning fractions, but their labour was vain. He spilled tears and regrets all over the bar and on their shoulders, which tears, however, did not wash away his opinion, that if one half was worth two hundred and fifty, two halves were worth three times as much.  <br><br>In the end,--and even Bidwell retained no more than hazy recollections of how the night terminated,--a bill of sale was drawn up, wherein Bill Rader and Charles Mitchell yielded up all right and title to the claim known as 24 ELDORADO, the same being the name the creek had received from some optimistic chechaquo.   <br><br>When Kink had signed, it took the united efforts of the three to arouse Bill.  Pen in hand, he swayed long over the document; and, each time he rocked back and forth, in Ans Handerson's eyes flashed and faded a wondrous golden vision.  When the precious signature was at last appended and the dust paid over, he breathed a great sigh, and sank to sleep under a table, where he dreamed immortally until morning.  <br><br>But the day was chill and grey.  He felt bad.  His first act, unconscious and automatic, was to feel for his sack.  Its lightness startled him.  Then, slowly, memories of the night thronged into his brain.  Rough voices disturbed him.  He opened his eyes and peered out from under the table.  A couple of early risers, or, rather, men who had been out on trail all night, were vociferating their opinions concerning the utter and loathsome worthlessness of Eldorado Creek.  He grew frightened, felt in his pocket, and found the deed to 24 ELDORADO.   <br><br>Ten minutes later Hootchinoo Bill and Kink Mitchell were roused from their blankets by a wild-eyed Swede that strove to force upon them an ink-scrawled and very blotty piece of paper.  <br><br>""Ay tank Ay take my money back,"" he gibbered.  ""Ay tank Ay take my money back.""   <br><br>Tears were in his eyes and throat.  They ran down his cheeks as he knelt before them and pleaded and implored.  But Bill and Kink did not laugh.  They might have been harder hearted.  <br><br>""First time I ever hear a man squeal over a minin' deal,"" Bill said.  ""An' I make free to say 'tis too onusual for me to savvy.""   <br><br>""Same here,"" Kink Mitchell remarked.  ""Minin' deals is like horse- tradin'.""  <br><br>They were honest in their wonderment.  They could not conceive of themselves raising a wail over a business transaction, so they could not understand it in another man.   <br><br>""The poor, ornery chechaquo,"" murmured Hootchinoo Bill, as they watched the sorrowing Swede disappear up the trail.  <br><br>""But this ain't Too Much Gold,"" Kink Mitchell said cheerfully.   <br><br>And ere the day was out they purchased flour and bacon at exorbitant prices with Ans Handerson's dust and crossed over the divide in the direction of the creeks that lie between Klondike and Indian River.  <br><br>Three months later they came back over the divide in the midst of a snow-storm and dropped down the trail to 24 ELDORADO.  It merely chanced that the trail led them that way.  They were not looking for the claim.  Nor could they see much through the driving white till they set foot upon the claim itself.  And then the air lightened, and they beheld a dump, capped by a windlass that a man was turning.  They saw him draw a bucket of gravel from the hole and tilt it on the edge of the dump.  Likewise they saw another, man, strangely familiar, filling a pan with the fresh gravel.  His hands were large; his hair wets pale yellow.  But before they reached him, he turned with the pan and fled toward a cabin.  He wore no hat, and the snow falling down his neck accounted for his haste.  Bill and Kink ran after him, and came upon him in the cabin, kneeling by the stove and washing the pan of gravel in a tub of water.   <br><br>He was too deeply engaged to notice more than that somebody had entered the cabin.  They stood at his shoulder and looked on.  He imparted to the pan a deft circular motion, pausing once or twice to rake out the larger particles of gravel with his fingers.  The water was muddy, and, with the pan buried in it, they could see nothing of its contents.  Suddenly he lifted the pan clear and sent the water out of it with a flirt.  A mass of yellow, like butter in a churn, showed across the bottom.  <br><br>Hootchinoo Bill swallowed.  Never in his life had he dreamed of so rich a test-pan.   <br><br>""Kind of thick, my friend,"" he said huskily.  ""How much might you reckon that-all to be?""  <br><br>Ans Handerson did not look up as he replied, ""Ay tank fafty ounces.""   <br><br>""You must be scrumptious rich, then, eh?""  <br><br>Still Ans Handerson kept his head down, absorbed in putting in the fine touches which wash out the last particles of dross, though he answered, ""Ay tank Ay ban wort' five hundred t'ousand dollar.""   <br><br>""Gosh!"" said Hootchinoo Bill, and he said it reverently.  <br><br>""Yes, Bill, gosh!"" said Kink Mitchell; and they went out softly and closed the door.                                    <br><br>"
48,When God Laughs,"Carquinez had relaxed finally.  He stole a glance at the rattling windows,  looked upward at the beamed roof, and listened for a moment to the savage  roar of the south-easter as it caught the bungalow in its bellowing jaws.  Then he held his glass between him and the fire and laughed for joy through  the golden wine.<br><br>    ""It is beautiful,"" he said.  ""It is sweetly sweet.  It is a woman's wine,  and it was made for gray-robed saints to drink.""<br><br>    ""We grow it on our own warm hills,"" I said, with pardonable California  pride.  ""You rode up yesterday through the vines from which it was made.""<br><br>    It was worth while to get Carquinez to loosen up.  Nor was he ever really  himself until he felt the mellow warmth of the vine singing in his blood.  He was an artist, it is true, always an artist; but somehow, sober, the  high pitch and lilt went out of his thought-processes and he was prone to  be as deadly dull as a British Sunday--not dull as other men are dull, but  dull when measured by the sprightly wight that Monte Carquinez was when he  was really himself.<br><br>    From all this it must not be inferred that Carquinez, who is my dear friend  and dearer comrade, was a sot.  Far from it.  He rarely erred.  As I have  said, he was an artist.  He knew when he had enough, and enough, with him,  was equilibrium--the equilibrium that is yours and mine when we are sober.<br><br>    His was a wise and instinctive temperateness that savoured of the Greek.  Yet he was far from Greek.  ""I am Aztec, I am Inca, I am Spaniard,"" I have  heard him say.  And in truth he looked it, a compound of strange and  ancient races, what with his swarthy skin and the asymmetry and  primitiveness of his features.  His eyes, under massively arched brows,  were wide apart and black with the blackness that is barbaric, while before  them was perpetually falling down a great black mop of hair through which  he gazed like a roguish satyr from a thicket.  He invariably wore a soft  flannel shirt under his velvet-corduroy jacket, and his necktie was red.  This latter stood for the red flag (he had once lived with the socialists  of Paris), and it symbolized the blood and brotherhood of man.  Also, he  had never been known to wear anything on his head save a leather-banded  sombrero.  It was even rumoured that he had been born with this particular  piece of headgear.  And in my experience it was provocative of nothing  short of sheer delight to see that Mexican sombrero hailing a cab in  Piccadilly or storm-tossed in the crush for the New York Elevated.<br><br>    As I have said, Carquinez was made quick by wine--""as the clay was made  quick when God breathed the breath of life into it,"" was his way of saying  it.  I confess that he was blasphemously intimate with God; and I must add  that there was no blasphemy in him.  He was at all times honest, and,  because he was compounded of paradoxes, greatly misunderstood by those who  did not know him.  He could be as elementally raw at times as a screaming  savage; and at other times as delicate as a maid, as subtle as a Spaniard.  And--well, was he not Aztec? Inca? Spaniard?<br><br>    And now I must ask pardon for the space I have given him.  (He is my  friend, and I love him.)  The house was shaking to the storm, as he drew  closer to the fire and laughed at it through his wine.  He looked at me,  and by the added lustre of his eye, and by the alertness of it, I knew that  at last he was pitched in his proper key.<br><br>    ""And so you think you've won out against the gods?"" he demanded.<br><br>    ""Why the gods?""<br><br>    ""Whose will but theirs has put satiety upon man?"" he cried.<br><br>    ""And whence the will in me to escape satiety?"" I asked triumphantly.<br><br>    ""Again the gods,"" he laughed.  ""It is their game we play.  They deal and  shuffle all the cards . . . and take the stakes.  Think not that you have  escaped by fleeing from the mad cities.  You with your vine-clad hills,  your sunsets and your sunrises, your homely fare and simple round of  living!<br><br>    ""I've watched you ever since I came.  You have not won.  You have  surrendered.  You have made terms with the enemy.  You have made confession  that you are tired.  You have flown the white flag of fatigue.  You have  nailed up a notice to the effect that life is ebbing down in you.  You have  run away from life.  You have played a trick, shabby trick.  You have  balked at the game.  You refuse to play.  You have thrown your cards under  the table and run away to hide, here amongst your hills.""<br><br>    He tossed his straight hair back from his flashing eyes, and scarcely  interrupted to roll a long, brown, Mexican cigarette.<br><br>    ""But the gods know.  It is an old trick.  All the generations of man have  tried it . . . and lost.  The gods know how to deal with such as you.  To  pursue is to possess, and to possess is to be sated.  And so you, in your  wisdom, have refused any longer to pursue.  You have elected surcease.  Very well.  You will become sated with surcease.  You say you have escaped  satiety!  You have merely bartered it for senility.  And senility is  another name for satiety.  It is satiety's masquerade.  Bah!""<br><br>    ""But look at me!"" I cried.<br><br>    Carquinez was ever a demon for haling ones soul out and making rags and  tatters of it.<br><br>    He looked me witheringly up and down.<br><br>    ""You see no signs,"" I challenged.<br><br>    ""Decay is insidious,"" he retorted.  ""You are rotten ripe.""<br><br>    I laughed and forgave him for his very deviltry.  But he refused to be  forgiven.<br><br>    ""Do I not know?"" he asked.  ""The gods always win.  I have watched men play  for years what seemed a winning game.  In the end they lost.""<br><br>    ""Don't you ever make mistakes?"" I asked.<br><br>    He blew many meditative rings of smoke before replying.<br><br>    ""Yes, I was nearly fooled, once.  Let me tell you.  There was Marvin Fiske.  You remember him?  And his Dantesque face and poet's soul, singing his  chant of the flesh, the very priest of Love?  And there was Ethel Baird,  whom also you must remember.""<br><br>    ""A warm saint,"" I said.<br><br>    ""That is she!  Holy as Love, and sweeter!  Just a woman, made for love; and  yet--how shall I say?--drenched through with holiness as your own air here  is with the perfume of flowers.  Well, they married.  They played a hand  with the gods--""<br><br>    ""And they won, they gloriously won!"" I broke in.<br><br>    Carquinez looked at me pityingly, and his voice was like a funeral bell.<br><br>    ""They lost.  They supremely, colossally lost.""<br><br>    ""But the world believes otherwise,"" I ventured coldly.<br><br>    ""The world conjectures.  The world sees only the face of things.  But I  know.  Has it ever entered your mind to wonder why she took the veil,  buried herself in that dolorous convent of the living dead?""<br><br>    ""Because she loved him so, and when he died . . .""<br><br>    Speech was frozen on my lips by Carquinez's sneer.<br><br>    ""A pat answer,"" he said, ""machine-made like a piece of cotton-drill.  The  world's judgment!  And much the world knows about it.  Like you, she fled  from life.  She was beaten.  She flung out the white flag of fatigue.  And  no beleaguered city ever flew that flag in such bitterness and tears.<br><br>    ""Now I shall tell you the whole tale, and you must believe me, for I know.  They had pondered the problem of satiety.  They loved Love.  They knew to  the uttermost farthing the value of Love.  They loved him so well that they  were fain to keep him always, warm and a-thrill in their hearts.  They  welcomed his coming; they feared to have him depart.<br><br>    ""Love was desire, they held, a delicious pain.  He was ever seeking  easement, and when he found that for which he sought, he died.  Love denied  was Love alive; Love granted was Love deceased.  Do you follow me?  They  saw it was not the way of life to be hungry for what it has.  To eat and  still be hungry--man has never accomplished that feat.  The problem of  satiety.  That is it.  To have and to keep the sharp famine-edge of  appetite at the groaning board.  This was their problem, for they loved  Love.  Often did they discuss it, with all Love's sweet ardours brimming in  their eyes; his ruddy blood spraying their cheeks; his voice playing in and  out with their voices, now hiding as a tremolo in their throats, and again  shading a tone with that ineffable tenderness which he alone can utter.<br><br>    ""How do I know all this?  I saw--much.  More I learned from her diary.  This I found in it, from Fiona Macleod:  'For, truly, that wandering voice,  that twilight-whisper, that breath so dewy-sweet, that flame-winged lute-  player whom none sees but for a moment, in a rainbow-shimmer of joy, or a  sudden lightning-flare of passion, this exquisite mystery we call Amor,  comes, to some rapt visionaries at least, not with a song upon the lips  that all may hear, or with blithe viol of public music, but as one wrought  by ecstasy, dumbly eloquent with desire.'<br><br>    ""How to keep the flame-winged lute-player with his dumb eloquence of  desire?  To feast him was to lose him.  Their love for each other was a  great love.  Their granaries were overflowing with plenitude; yet they  wanted to keep the sharp famine-edge of their love undulled.<br><br>    ""Nor were they lean little fledglings theorizing on the threshold of Love.  They were robust and realized souls.  They had loved before, with others,  in the days before they met; and in those days they had throttled Love with  caresses, and killed him with kisses, and buried him in the pit of satiety.<br><br>    ""They were not cold wraiths, this man and woman.  They were warm human.  They had no Saxon soberness in their blood.  The colour of it was sunset-  red.  They glowed with it.  Temperamentally theirs was the French joy in  the flesh.  They were idealists, but their idealism was Gallic.  It was not  tempered by the chill and sombre fluid that for the English serves as  blood.  There was no stoicism about them.  They were Americans, descended  out of the English, and yet the refraining and self-denying of the English  spirit-groping were not theirs.<br><br>    ""They were all this that I have said, and they were made for joy, only they  achieved a concept.  A curse on concepts!  They played with logic, and this  was their logic.--But first let me tell you of a talk we had one night.  It  was of Gautier's Madeline de Maupin.  You remember the maid?  She kissed  once, and once only, and kisses she would have no more.  Not that she found  kisses were not sweet, but that she feared with repetition they would cloy.  Satiety again!  She tried to play without stakes against the gods.  Now  this is contrary to a rule of the game the gods themselves have made.  Only  the rules are not posted over the table.  Mortals must play in order to  learn the rules.<br><br>    ""Well, to the logic.  The man and the woman argued thus:  Why kiss once  only?  If to kiss once were wise, was it not wiser to kiss not at all?  Thus could they keep Love alive.  Fasting, he would knock forever at their  hearts.<br><br>    ""Perhaps it was out of their heredity that they achieved this unholy  concept.  The breed will out and sometimes most fantastically.  Thus in  them did cursed Albion array herself a scheming wanton, a bold, cold-  calculating, and artful hussy.  After all, I do not know.  But this I know:  it was out of their inordinate desire for joy that they forewent joy.<br><br>    ""As he said (I read it long afterward in one of his letters to her):  'To  hold you in my arms, close, and yet not close.  To yearn for you, and never  to have you, and so always to have you.'  And she:  'For you to be always  just beyond my reach.  To be ever attaining you, and yet never attaining  you, and for this to last forever, always fresh and new, and always with  the first flush upon us.<br><br>    ""That is not the way they said it.  On my lips their love-philosophy is  mangled.  And who am I to delve into their soul-stuff?  I am a frog, on the  dank edge of a great darkness, gazing goggle-eyed at the mystery and wonder  of their flaming souls.<br><br>    ""And they were right, as far as they went.  Everything is good . . . as  long as it is unpossessed.  Satiety and possession are Death's horses; they  run in span.<br><br>           ""'And time could only tutor us to eke         Our rapture's warmth with custom's afterglow.'<br><br>    ""They got that from a sonnet of Alfred Austin's.  It was called 'Love's  Wisdom.'  It was the one kiss of Madeline de Maupin.  How did it run?<br><br>           ""'Kiss we and part; no further can we go;         And better death than we from high to low     Should dwindle, or decline from strong to weak.'<br><br>    ""But they were wiser.  They would not kiss and part.  They would not kiss  at all, and thus they planned to stay at Love's topmost peak.  They  married.  You were in England at the time.  And never was there such a  marriage.  They kept their secret to themselves.  I did not know, then.  Their rapture's warmth did not cool.  Their love burned with increasing  brightness.  Never was there anything like it.  The time passed, the  months, the years, and ever the flame-winged lute-player grew more  resplendent.<br><br>    ""Everybody marvelled.  They became the wonderful lovers, and they were  greatly envied.  Sometimes women pitied her because she was childless; it  is the form the envy of such creatures takes.<br><br>    ""And I did not know their secret.  I pondered and I marvelled.  As first I  had expected, subconsciously I imagine, the passing of their love.  Then I  became aware that it was Time that passed and Love that remained.  Then I  became curious.  What was their secret?  What were the magic fetters with  which they bound Love to them?  How did they hold the graceless elf?  What  elixir of eternal love had they drunk together as had Tristram and Iseult  of old time?  And whose hand had brewed the fairy drink?<br><br>    ""As I say, I was curious, and I watched them.  They were love-mad.  They  lived in an unending revel of Love.  They made a pomp and ceremonial of it.  They saturated themselves in the art and poetry of Love.  No, they were not  neurotics.  They were sane and healthy, and they were artists.  But they  had accomplished the impossible.  They had achieved deathless desire.<br><br>    ""And I?  I saw much of them and their everlasting miracle of Love.  I  puzzled and wondered, and then one day--""<br><br>    Carquinez broke off abruptly and asked, ""Have you ever read, 'Love's  Waiting Time'?""<br><br>    I shook my head.<br><br>    ""Page wrote it--Curtis Hidden Page, I think.  Well, it was that bit of  verse that gave me the clue.  One day, in the window-seat near the big  piano--you remember how she could play?  She used to laugh, sometimes, and  doubt whether it was for them I came, or for the music.  She called me a  'music-sot' once, a 'sound-debauchee.'  What a voice he had!  When he sang  I believed in immortality, my regard for the gods grew almost patronizing  and I devised ways and means whereby I surely could outwit them and their  tricks.<br><br>    ""It was a spectacle for God, that man and woman, years married, and singing  love-songs with a freshness virginal as new-born Love himself, with a  ripeness and wealth of ardour that young lovers can never know.  Young  lovers were pale and anaemic beside that long-married pair.  To see them,  all fire and flame and tenderness, at a trembling distance, lavishing  caresses of eye and voice with every action, through every silence--their  love driving them toward each other, and they withholding like fluttering  moths, each to the other a candle-flame, and revolving each about the other  in the mad gyrations of an amazing orbit-flight!  It seemed, in obedience  to some great law of physics, more potent than gravitation and more subtle,  that they must corporeally melt each into each there before my very eyes.  Small wonder they were called the wonderful lovers.<br><br>    ""I have wandered.  Now to the clue.  One day in the window-seat I found a  book of verse.  It opened of itself, betraying long habit, to 'Love's  Waiting Time.'  The page was thumbed and limp with overhandling, and there  I read:--<br><br>           ""'So sweet it is to stand but just apart,         To know each other better, and to keep         The soft, delicious sense of two that touch . . .<br><br>           O love, not yet! . . .  Sweet, let us keep our love         Wrapped round with sacred mystery awhile,         Waiting the secret of the coming years,         That come not yet, not yet . . . sometime . . .                      not yet . . .<br><br>           Oh, yet a little while our love may grow!         When it has blossomed it will haply die.         Feed it with lipless kisses, let it sleep,         Bedded in dead denial yet some while . . .         Oh, yet a little while, a little while.'<br><br>    ""I folded the book on my thumb and sat there silent and without moving for  a long time.  I was stunned by the clearness of vision the verse had  imparted to me.  It was illumination.  It was like a bolt of God's  lightning in the Pit.  They would keep Love, the fickle sprite, the  forerunner of young life--young life that is imperative to be born!<br><br>    ""I conned the lines over in my mind--'Not yet, sometime'--'O Love, not  yet'--'Feed it with lipless kisses, let it sleep.'  And I laughed aloud,  ha, ha!  I saw with white vision their blameless souls.  They were  children.  They did not understand.  They played with Nature's fire and  bedded with a naked sword.  They laughed at the gods.  They would stop the  cosmic sap.  They had invented a system, and brought it to the gaming-table  of life, and expected to win out.  'Beware!' I cried.  'The gods are behind  the table.  They make new rules for every system that is devised.  You have  no chance to win.'<br><br>    ""But I did not so cry to them.  I waited.  They would learn that their  system was worthless and throw it away.  They would be content with  whatever happiness the gods gave them and not strive to wrest more away.<br><br>    ""I watched.  I said nothing.  The months continued to come and go, and  still the famine-edge of their love grew the sharper.  Never did they dull  it with a permitted love-clasp.  They ground and whetted it on self-denial,  and sharper and sharper it grew.  This went on until even I doubted.  Did  the gods sleep?  I wondered.  Or were they dead?  I laughed to myself.  The  man and the woman had made a miracle.  They had outwitted God.  They had  shamed the flesh, and blackened the face of the good Earth Mother.  They  had played with her fire and not been burned.  They were immune.  They were  themselves gods, knowing good from evil and tasting not.  'Was this the way  gods came to be?' I asked myself.  'I am a frog,' I said.  'But for my mud-  lidded eyes I should have been blinded by the brightness of this wonder I  have witnessed.  I have puffed myself up with my wisdom and passed judgment  upon gods.'<br><br>    ""Yet even in this, my latest wisdom, I was wrong.  They were not gods.  They were man and woman--soft clay that sighed and thrilled, shot through  with desire, thumbed with strange weaknesses which the gods have not.""<br><br>    Carquinez broke from his narrative to roll another cigarette and to laugh  harshly.  It was not a pretty laugh; it was like the mockery of a devil,  and it rose over and rode the roar of the storm that came muffled to our  ears from the crashing outside world.<br><br>    ""I am a frog,"" he said apologetically.  ""How were they to understand?  They  were artists, not biologists.  They knew the clay of the studio, but they  did not know the clay of which they themselves were made.  But this I will  say--they played high.  Never was there such a game before, and I doubt me  if there will ever be such a game again.<br><br>    ""Never was lovers' ecstasy like theirs.  They had not killed Love with  kisses.  They had quickened him with denial.  And by denial they drove him  on till he was all aburst with desire.  And the flame-winged lute-player  fanned them with his warm wings till they were all but swooning.  It was  the very delirium of Love, and it continued undiminished and increasing  through the weeks and months.<br><br>    ""They longed and yearned, with all the fond pangs and sweet delicious  agonies, with an intensity never felt by lovers before nor since.<br><br>    ""And then one day the drowsy gods ceased nodding.  They aroused and looked  at the man and woman who had made a mock of them.  And the man and woman  looked into each other's eyes one morning and knew that something was gone.  It was the flame-winged one.  He had fled, silently, in the night, from  their anchorites' board.<br><br>    ""They looked into each other's eyes and knew that they did not care.  Desire was dead.  Do you understand?  Desire was dead.  And they had never  kissed.  Not once had they kissed.  Love was gone.  They would never yearn  and burn again.  For them there was nothing left--no more tremblings and  flutterings and delicious anguishes, no more throbbing and pulsing, and  sighing and song.  Desire was dead.  It had died in the night, on a couch  cold and unattended; nor had they witnessed its passing.  They learned it  for the first time in each other's eyes.<br><br>    ""The gods may not be kind, but they are often merciful.  They had twirled  the little ivory ball and swept the stakes from the table.  All that  remained was the man and woman gazing into each other's cold eyes.  And  then he died.  That was the mercy.  Within the week Marvin Fiske was dead--  you remember the accident.  And in her diary, written at this time, I long  afterward read Mitchell Kennerly's:--<br><br>           ""'There was not a single hour         We might have kissed and did not kiss.'""<br><br>    ""Oh, the irony of it!"" I cried out.<br><br>    And Carquinez, in the firelight a veritable Mephistopheles in velvet  jacket, fixed me with his black eyes.<br><br>    ""And they won, you said?  The world's judgment!  I have told you, and I  know.  They won as you are winning, here in your hills.""<br><br>    ""But you,"" I demanded hotly; ""you with your orgies of sound and sense, with  your mad cities and madder frolics--bethink you that you win?""<br><br>    He shook his head slowly.  ""Because you with your sober bucolic regime,  lose, is no reason that I should win.  We never win.  Sometimes we think we  win.  That is a little pleasantry of the gods.""  						                                      <br><br>"
49,When the World was Young,"HE was a very quiet, self-possessed sort of man, sitting a  moment on top of the wall to sound the damp darkness for  warnings of the dangers it might conceal. But the plummet of  his hearing brought nothing to him save the moaning of wind  through invisible trees and the rustling of leaves on swaying  branches. A heavy fog drifted and drove before the wind, and  though he could not see this fog, the wet of it blew upon his  face, and the wall on which he sat was wet.<br><br>    Without noise he had climbed to the top of the wall from the  outside, and without noise he dropped to the ground on the  inside. From his pocket he drew an electric night-stick, but he  did not use it. Dark as the way was, he was not anxious for  light. Carrying the night-stick in his hand, his finger on the  button, he advanced through the darkness. The ground was  velvety and springy to his feet, being carpeted with dead  pine-needles and leaves and mold which evidently bad been  undisturbed for years. Leaves and branches brushed against his  body, but so dark was it that he could not avoid them. Soon he  walked with his hand stretched out gropingly before him, and  more than once the hand fetched up against the solid trunks of  massive trees. All about him he knew were these trees; he  sensed the loom of them everywhere; and he experienced a  strange feeling of microscopic smallness in the midst of great  bulks leaning toward him to crush him. Beyond, he knew, was the  house, and he expected to find some trail or winding path that  would lead easily to it.<br><br>    Once, he found himself trapped. On every side he groped against  trees and branches, or blundered into thickets of underbrush,  until there seemed no way out. Then he turned on his light,  circumspectly, directing its rays to the ground at his feet.  Slowly and carefully he moved it about him, the white  brightness showing in sharp detail all the obstacles to his  progress. He saw, an opening between huge-trunked trees, and  advanced through it, putting out the light and treading on dry  footing as yet protected from the drip of the fog by the dense  foliage overhead. His sense of direction was good, and he knew  he was going toward the house.<br><br>    And then the thing happened--the thing unthinkable and  unexpected. His descending foot came down upon something that  was soft and alive, and that arose with a snort under the  weight of his body. He sprang clear, and crouched for another  spring, anywhere, tense and expectant, keyed for the onslaught  of the unknown. He waited a moment, wondering what manner of  animal it was that had arisen from under his foot and that now  made no sound nor movement and that must be crouching and  waiting just as tensely and expectantly as he. The strain  became unbearable. Holding the night-stick before him, he  pressed the button, saw, and screamed aloud in terror. He was  prepared for anything, from a frightened calf or fawn to a  belligerent lion, but he was not prepared for what he saw. In  that instant his tiny searchlight, sharp and white, had shown  him what a thousand years would not en. able him to forget--a  man, huge and blond, yellow-haired and yellow-bearded, naked  except for soft-tanned moccasins and what seemed a goat-skin  about his middle. Arms and legs were bare, as were his  shoulders and most of his chest. The skin was smooth and  hairless, but browned by sun and wind, while under it heavy  muscles were knotted like fat snakes. Still, this alone,  unexpected as it well was, was not what had made the man scream  out. What had caused his terror was the unspeakable ferocity of  the face, the wild-animal glare of the blue eyes scarcely  dazzled by the light, the pine-needles matted and clinging in  the beard and hair, and the whole formidable body crouched and  in the act of springing at him. Practically in the instant he  saw all this, and while his scream still rang, the thing  leaped, he flung his night-stick full at it, and threw himself  to the ground. He felt its feet and shins strike against his  ribs, and he bounded up and away while the thing itself hurled  onward in a heavy crashing fall into the underbrush.<br><br>    As the noise of the fall ceased, the man stopped and on hands  and knees waited. He could hear the thing moving about,  searching for him, and he was afraid to advertise his location  by attempting further flight. He knew that inevitably he would  crackle the underbrush and be pursued. Once he drew out his  revolver, then changed his mind. He had recovered his composure  and hoped to get away without noise. Several times he heard the  thing beating up the thickets for him, and there were moments  when it, too, remained still and listened. This gave an idea to  the man. One of his hands was resting on a chunk of dead wood.  Carefully, first feeling about him in the darkness to know that  the full swing of his arm was clear, he raised the chunk of  wood and threw it. It was not a large piece, and it went far,  landing noisily in a bush. He heard the thing bound into the  bush, and at the same time himself crawled steadily away. And  on hands and knees, slowly and cautiously, he crawled on, till  his knees were wet on the soggy mold, When he listened he heard  naught but the moaning wind and the drip-drip of the fog from  the branches. Never abating his caution, he stood erect and  went on to the stone wall, over which he climbed and dropped  down to the road outside.<br><br>    Feeling his way in a clump of bushes, he drew out a bicycle and  prepared to mount. He was in the act of driving the gear around  with his foot for the purpose of getting the opposite pedal in  position, when he heard the thud of a heavy body that landed  lightly and evidently on its feet. He did not wait for more,  but ran, with hands on the handles of his bicycle, until he was  able to vault astride the saddle, catch the pedals, and start a  spurt. Behind he could hear the quick thud-thud of feet on the  dust of the road, but he drew away from it and lost it.  Unfortunately, he had started away from the direction of town  and was heading higher up into the hills. He knew that on this  particular road there were no cross roads. The only way back  was past that terror, and he could not steel himself to face  it. At the end of half an hour, finding himself on an ever  increasing grade, he dismounted. For still greater safety,  leaving the wheel by the roadside, he climbed through a fence  into what he decided was a hillside pasture, spread a newspaper  on the ground, and sat down.<br><br>    ""Gosh!"" he said aloud, mopping the sweat and fog from his face.<br><br>    And ""Gosh!"" he said once again, while rolling a cigarette and  as he pondered the problem of getting back.<br><br>    But he made no attempt to go back. He was resolved not to face  that road in the dark, and with head bowed on knees, he dozed,  waiting for daylight.<br><br>    How long afterward he did not know, he was awakened by the  yapping bark of a young coyote. As he looked about and located  it on the brow of the hill behind him, he noted the change that  had come over the face of the night. The fog was gone; the  stars and moon were out; even the wind had died down. It had  transformed into a balmy California summer night. He tried to  doze again, but the yap of the coyote disturbed him. Half  asleep, he heard a wild and eery chant. Looking about him, he  noticed that the coyote had ceased its noise and was running  away along the crest of the hill, and behind it, in full  pursuit, no longer chanting, ran the naked creature he had  encountered in the garden. It was a young coyote, and it was  being overtaken when the chase passed from view. The man  trembled as with a chill as he started to his feet, clambered  over the fence, and mounted his wheel. But it was his chance  and he knew it. The terror was no longer between him and Mill  Valley.<br><br>    He sped at a breakneck rate down the hill, but in the turn at  the bottom, in the deep shadows, he encountered a chuck-hole  and pitched headlong over the handle bar.<br><br>    ""It's sure not my night,"" he muttered, as he examined the  broken fork of the machine<br><br>    Shouldering the useless wheel, he trudged on. In time he came  to the stone wall, and, half disbelieving his experience, he  sought in the road for tracks, and found them--moccasin tracks,  large ones, deep-bitten into the dust at the toes. It was while  bending over them, examining, that again he heard the eery  chant. He had seen the thing pursue the coyote, and he knew he  had no chance on a straight run. He did not attempt it,  contenting himself with hiding in the shadows on the off side  of the road.<br><br>    And again he saw the thing that was like a naked man, running  swiftly and lightly and singing as it ran. Opposite him it  paused, and his heart stood still. But instead of coming toward  his hiding-place, it leaped into the air, caught the branch of  a roadside tree, and swung swiftly upward, from limb to limb,  like an ape. It swung across the wall, and a dozen feet above  the top, into the branches of another tree, and dropped out of  sight to the ground. The man waited a few wondering minutes,  then started on.<br><br>    <b>II</b><br><br>    Dave Slotter leaned belligerently against the desk that barred  the way to the private office of James Ward, senior partner of  the firm of Ward, Knowles & Co. Dave was angry. Every one in  the outer office had looked him over suspiciously, and the man  who faced him was excessively suspicious.<br><br>    ""You just tell Mr. Ward it's important,"" he urged.<br><br>    ""I tell you he is dictating and cannot be disturbed,"" was the  answer. ""Come to-morrow.""<br><br>    ""To-morrow will be too late. You just trot along and tell Mr.  Ward it's a matter of life and death.""<br><br>    The secretary hesitated and Dave seized the advantage.<br><br>    ""You just tell him I was across the bay in Mill Valley last  night, and that I want to put him wise to something.""<br><br>    ""What name?"" was the query.<br><br>    ""Never mind the name. He don't know me.""<br><br>    When Dave was shown into the private office, he was still in  the belligerent frame of mind, but when he saw a large fair man  whirl in a revolving chair from dictating to a stenographer to  face him, Dave's demeanor abruptly changed. He did not know why  it changed, and he was secretly angry with himself.<br><br>    ""You are Mr. Ward?"" Dave asked with a fatuousness that still  further irritated him. He had never intended it at all.<br><br>    ""Yes,"" came the answer.<br><br>    ""And who are you?""<br><br>    ""Harry Bancroft,"" Dave lied. ""You don't know me, and my name  don't matter.""<br><br>    ""You sent in word that you were in Mill Valley last night?""<br><br>    ""You live there, don't you?"" Dave countered, looking  suspiciously at the stenographer.<br><br>    ""Yes. What do you mean to see me about? I am very busy.""<br><br>    ""I'd like to see you alone, sir.""<br><br>    Mr. Ward gave him a quick, penetrating look, hesitated, then  made up his mind.<br><br>    ""That will do for a few minutes, Miss Potter.""<br><br>    The girl arose, gathered her notes together, and passed out.  Dave looked at Mr. James Ward wonderingly, until that gentleman  broke his train of inchoate thought.<br><br>    ""Well?""<br><br>    ""I was over in Mill Valley last night,"" Dave began confusedly. <br><br>    ""I've heard that before. What do you want?""<br><br>    And Dave proceeded in the face of a growing conviction that was  unbelievable. ""I was at your house, or in the grounds, I mean.""<br><br>    ""What were you doing there?""<br><br>    ""I came to break in,"" Dave answered in all frankness.<br><br>    ""I heard you lived all alone with a Chinaman for cook, and it  looked good to me. Only I didn't break in. Something happened  that prevented. That's why I'm here. I come to warn you. I  found a wild man loose in your grounds--a regular devil. He  could pull a guy like me to pieces. He gave me the run of my  life. He don't wear any clothes to speak of, he climbs trees  like a monkey, and he runs like a deer. I saw him chasing a  coyote, and the last I saw of it, by God, he was gaining on  it.""<br><br>    Dave paused and looked for the effect that would follow his  words. But no effect came. James Ward was quietly curious, and  that was all.<br><br>    ""Very remarkable, very remarkable,"" he murmured. ""A wild man,  you say. Why have you come to tell me?""<br><br>    ""To warn you of your danger. I'm something of a hard  proposition myself, but I don't believe in killing people . . .  that is, unnecessarily. I realized that you was in danger. I  thought I'd warn you. Honest, that's the game. Of course, if  you wanted to give me anything for my trouble, I'd take it.  That was in my mind, too. But I don't care whether you give me  anything or not. I've warned you any way, and done my duty.""<br><br>    Mr. Ward meditated and drummed on the surface of his desk. Dave  noticed they were large, powerful hands, withal well-cared for  despite their dark sunburn. Also, he noted what had already  caught his eye before--a tiny strip of flesh-colored  courtplaster on the forehead over one eve. And still the  thought that forced itself into his mind was unbelievable.<br><br>    Mr. Ward took a wallet from his inside coat pocket, drew out a  greenback, and passed it to Dave, who noted as he pocketed it  that it was for twenty dollars.<br><br>    ""Thank you,"" said Mr. Ward, indicating that the interview was  at an end.<br><br>    ""I shall have the matter investigated. A wild man running loose  IS dangerous.""<br><br>    But so quiet a man was Mr. Ward, that Dave's courage returned.  Besides, a new theory had suggested itself. The wild man was  evidently Mr. Ward's brother, a lunatic privately confined.  Dave had heard of such things. Perhaps Mr. Ward wanted it kept  quiet. That was why he had given him the twenty dollars.<br><br>    ""Say,"" Dave began, ""now I come to think of it that wild man  looked a lot like you--""<br><br>    That was as far as Dave got, for at that moment he witnessed a  transformation and found himself gazing into the same  unspeakably ferocious blue eyes of the night before, at the  same clutching talon-like hands, and at the same formidable  bulk in the act of springing upon him. But this time Dave had  no night-stick to throw, and he was caught by the biceps of  both arms in a grip so terrific that it made him groan with  pain. He saw the large white teeth exposed, for all the world  as a dog's about to bite. Mr. Ward's beard brushed his face as  the teeth went in for the grip on his throat. But the bite was  not given. Instead, Dave felt the other's body stiffen as with  an iron restraint, and then he was flung aside, without effort  but with such force that only the wall stopped his momentum and  dropped him gasping to the floor.<br><br>    ""What do you mean by coming here and trying to blackmail me?""  Mr. Ward was snarling at him. ""Here, give me back that money.""<br><br>    Dave passed the bill back without a word.<br><br>    ""I thought you came here with good intentions. I know you now.  Let me see and hear no more of you, or I'll put you in prison  where you belong. Do you understand?""<br><br>    ""Yes, sir,"" Dave gasped.<br><br>    ""Then go.""<br><br>    And Dave went, without further word, both his biceps aching  intolerably from the bruise of that tremendous grip. As his  hand rested on the door knob, he was stopped.<br><br>    ""You were lucky,"" Mr. Ward was saying, and Dave noted that his  face and eyes were cruel and gloating and proud.<br><br>    ""You were lucky. Had I wanted, I could have torn your muscles  out of your arms and thrown them in the waste basket there.""<br><br>    ""Yes, sir,"" said Dave; and absolute conviction vibrated in his voice.<br><br>    He opened the door and passed out. The secretary looked at him  interrogatively.<br><br>    ""Gosh!"" was all Dave vouchsafed, and with this utterance passed  out of the offices and the story.<br><br>    <b>III</b><br><br>    James G. Ward was forty years of age, a successful business  man, and very unhappy. For forty years he had vainly tried to  solve a problem that was really himself and that with  increasing years became more and more a woeful affliction. In  himself he was two men, and, chronologically speaking, these  men were several thousand years or so apart. He had studied the  question of dual personality probably more profoundly than any  half dozen of the leading specialists in that intricate and  mysterious psychological field. In himself he was a different  case from any that had been recorded. Even the most fanciful  flights of the fiction-writers had not quite hit upon him. He  was not a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, nor was he like the  unfortunate young man in Kipling's ""Greatest Story in the  World."" His two personalities were so mixed that they were  practically aware of themselves and of each other all the time.<br><br>    His other self he had located as a savage and a barbarian  living under the primitive conditions of several thousand years  before. But which self was he, and which was the other, he  could never tell. For he was both selves, and both selves all  the time. Very rarely indeed did it happen that one self did  not know what the other was doing. Another thing was that he  had no visions nor memories of the past in which that early  self had lived. That early self lived in the present; but while  it lived in the present, it was under the compulsion to live  the way of life that must have been in that distant past.<br><br>    In his childhood he had been a problem to his father and  mother, and to the family doctors, though never had they come  within a thousand miles of hitting upon the clue to his  erratic, conduct. Thus, they could not understand his excessive  somnolence in the forenoon, nor his excessive activity at  night. When they found him wandering along the hallways at  night, or climbing over giddy roofs, or running in the hills,  they decided he was a somnambulist. In reality he was wide-eyed  awake and merely under the nightroaming compulsion of his early  self. Questioned by an obtuse medico, he once told the truth  and suffered the ignominy of having the revelation  contemptuously labeled and dismissed as ""dreams.""<br><br>    The point was, that as twilight and evening came on he became  wakeful. The four walls of a room were an irk and a restraint.  He heard a thousand voices whispering to him through the  darkness. The night called to him, for he was, for that period  of the twenty-four hours, essentially a night-prowler. But  nobody understood, and never again did he attempt to explain.  They classified him as a sleep-walker and took precautions  accordingly--precautions that very often were futile. As his  childhood advanced, he grew more cunning, so that the major  portion of all his nights were spent in the open at realizing  his other self. As a result, he slept in the forenoons. Morning  studies and schools were impossible, and it was discovered that  only in the afternoons, under private teachers, could he be  taught anything. Thus was his modern self educated and  developed.<br><br>    But a problem, as a child, he ever remained. He was known as a  little demon, of insensate cruelty and viciousness. The family  medicos privately adjudged him a mental monstrosity and  degenerate. Such few boy companions as he had, hailed him as a  wonder, though they were all afraid of him. He could outclimb,  outswim, outrun, outdevil any of them; while none dared fight  with him. He was too terribly strong, madly furious.<br><br>    When nine years of age he ran away to the hills, where he  flourished, night-prowling, for seven weeks before he was  discovered and brought home. The marvel was how he had managed  to subsist and keep in condition during that time. They did not  know, and he never told them, of the rabbits he had killed, of  the quail, young and old, he had captured and devoured, of the  farmers' chicken-roosts he had raided, nor of the cave-lair he  had made and carpeted with dry leaves and grasses and in which  he had slept in warmth and comfort through the forenoons of  many days.<br><br>    At college he was notorious for his sleepiness and stupidity  during the morning lectures and for his brilliance in the  afternoon. By collateral reading and by borrowing the notebook  of his fellow students he managed to scrape through the  detestable morning courses, while his afternoon courses were  triumphs. In football he proved a giant and a terror, and, in  almost every form of track athletics, save for strange  Berserker rages that were sometimes displayed, he could be  depended upon to win. But his fellows were afraid to box with  him, and he signalized his last wrestling bout by sinking his  teeth into the shoulder of his opponent.<br><br>    After college, his father, in despair, sent him among the  cow-punchers of a Wyoming ranch. Three months later the doughty  cowmen confessed he was too much for them and telegraphed his  father to come and take the wild man away. Also, when the  father arrived to take him away, the cowmen allowed that they  would vastly prefer chumming with howling cannibals, gibbering  lunatics, cavorting gorillas, grizzly bears, and man-eating  tigers than with this particular Young college product with  hair parted in the middle.<br><br>    There was one exception to the lack of memory of the life of  his early self, and that was language. By some quirk of  atavism, a certain portion of that early self's language had  come down to him as a racial memory. In moments of happiness,  exaltation, or battle, he was prone to burst out in wild  barbaric songs or chants. It was by this means that he located  in time and space that strayed half of him who should have been  dead and dust for thousands of years. He sang, once, and  deliberately, several of the ancient chants in the presence of  Professor Wertz, who gave courses in old Saxon and who was a  philogist of repute and passion. At the first one, the  professor pricked up his ears and demanded to know what mongrel  tongue or hog-German it was. When the second chant was  rendered, the professor was highly excited. James Ward then  concluded the performance by giving a song that always  irresistibly rushed to his lips when he was engaged in fierce  struggling or fighting. Then it was that Professor Wertz  proclaimed it no hog-German, but early German, or early Teuton,  of a date that must far precede anything that had ever been  discovered and handed down by the scholars. So early was it  that it was beyond him; yet it was filled with haunting  reminiscences of word-forms he knew and which his trained  intuition told him were true and real. He demanded the source  of the songs, and asked to borrow the precious book that  contained them. Also, he demanded to know why young Ward had  always posed as being profoundly ignorant of the German  language. And Ward could neither explain his ignorance nor lend  the book. Whereupon, after pleadings and entreaties that  extended through weeks, Professor Wert took a dislike to the  young man, believed him a liar, and classified him as a man of  monstrous selfishness for not giving him a glimpse of this  wonderful screed that was older than the oldest any philologist  had ever known or dreamed.<br><br>    But little good did it do this much-mixed young man to know  that half of him was late American and the other half early  Teuton. Nevertheless, the late American in him was no weakling,  and he (if he were a he and had a shred of existence outside of  these two) compelled an adjustment or compromise between his  one self that was a nightprowling savage that kept his other  self sleepy of mornings, and that other self that was cultured  and refined and that wanted to be normal and live and love and  prosecute business like other people. The afternoons and early  evenings he gave to the one, the nights to the other; the  forenoons and parts of the nights were devoted to sleep for the  twain. But in the mornings he slept in bed like a civilized  man. In the night time he slept like a wild animal, as he had  slept Dave Slotter stepped on him in the woods.<br><br>    Persuading his father to advance the capital, he went into  business and keen and successful business he made of it,  devoting his afternoons whole-souled to it, while his partner  devoted the mornings. The early evenings he spent socially,  but, as the hour grew to nine or ten, an irresistible  restlessness overcame him and he disappeared from the haunts of  men until the next afternoon. Friends and acquaintances thought  that he spent much of his time in sport. And they were right,  though they never would have dreamed of the nature of the  sport, even if they had seen him running coyotes in  night-chases over the hills of Mill Valley. Neither were the  schooner captains believed when they reported seeing, on cold  winter mornings, a man swimming in the tide-rips of Raccoon  Straits or in the swift currents between Goat island and Angel  Island miles from shore.<br><br>    In the bungalow at Mill Valley he lived alone, save for Lee  Sing, the Chinese cook and factotum, who knew much about the  strangeness of his master, who was paid well for saying  nothing, and who never did say anything. After the satisfaction  of his nights, a morning's sleep, and a breakfast of Lee  Sing's, James Ward crossed the bay to San Francisco on a midday  ferryboat and went to the club and on to his office, as normal  and conventional a man of business as could be found in the  city. But as the evening lengthened, the night called to him.  There came a quickening of all his perceptions and a  restlessness. His hearing was suddenly acute; the myriad  night-noises told him a luring and familiar story; and, if  alone, he would begin to pace up and down the narrow room like  any caged animal from the wild.<br><br>    Once, he ventured to fall in love. He never permitted himself  that diversion again. He was afraid. And for many a day the  young lady, scared at least out of a portion of her young  ladyhood, bore on her arms and shoulders and wrists divers  black-and-blue bruises--tokens of caresses which he had  bestowed in all fond gentleness but too late at night. There  was the mistake. Had he ventured love-making in the afternoon,  all would have been well, for it would have been as the quiet  gentleman that he would have made love--but at night it was the  uncouth, wife-stealing savage of the dark German forests. Out  of his wisdom, he decided that afternoon love-making could be  prosecuted successfully; but out of the same wisdom he was  convinced that marriage as would prove a ghastly failure. He  found it appalling to imagine being married and encountering  his wife after dark.<br><br>    So he had eschewed all love-making, regulated his dual life,  cleaned up a million in business, fought shy of match-making  mamas and bright-eyed and eager young ladies of various ages,  met Lilian Gersdale and made it a rigid observance never to see  her later than eight o'clock in the evening, run of nights  after his coyotes, and slept in forest lairs--and through it  all had kept his secret safe save Lee Sing . . . and now, Dave  Slotter. It was the latter's discovery of both his selves that  frightened him. In spite of the counter fright he had given the  burglar, the latter might talk. And even if he did not, sooner  or later he would be found out by some one else.<br><br>    Thus it was that James Ward made a fresh and heroic effort to  control the Teutonic barbarian that was half of him. So well  did he make it a point to see Lilian in the afternoons, that  the time came when she accepted him for better or worse, and  when he prayed privily and fervently that it was not for worse.  During this period no prize-fighter ever trained more harshly  and faithfully for a contest than he trained to subdue the wild  savage in him. Among other things, he strove to exhaust himself  during the day, so that sleep would render him deaf to the call  of the night. He took a vacation from the office and went on  long hunting trips, following the deer through the most  inaccessible and rugged country he could find--and always in  the daytime. Night found him indoors and tired. At home he  installed a score of exercise machines, and where other men  might go through a particular movement ten times, he went  hundreds. Also, as a compromise, he built a sleeping porch on  the second story. Here he at least breathed the blessed night  air. Double screens prevented him from escaping into the woods,  and each night Lee Sing locked him in and each morning let him  out.<br><br>    The time came, in the month of August, when he engaged  additional servants to assist Lee Sing and dared a house party  in his Mill Valley bungalow. Lilian, her mother and brother,  and half a dozen mutual friends, were the guests. For two days  and nights all went well. And on the third night, playing  bridge till eleven o'clock, he had reason to be proud of  himself. His restlessness fully hid, but as luck would have it,  Lilian Gersdale was his opponent on his right. She was a frail  delicate flower of a woman, and in his night-mood her very  frailty incensed him. Not that he loved her less, but that he  felt almost irresistibly impelled to reach out and paw and maul  her. Especially was this true when she was engaged in playing a  winning hand against him.<br><br>    He had one of the deer-hounds brought in and, when it seemed he  must fly to pieces with the tension, a caressing hand laid on  the animal brought him relief. These contacts with the hairy  coat gave him instant easement and enabled him to play out the  evening. Nor did anyone guess the while terrible struggle their  host was making, the while he laughed so carelessly and played  so keenly and deliberately.<br><br>    When they separated for the night, he saw to it that he parted  from Lilian in the presence or the others. Once on his sleeping  porch and safely locked in, he doubled and tripled and even  quadrupled his exercises until, exhausted, he lay down on the  couch to woo sleep and to ponder two problems that especially  troubled him. One was this matter of exercise. It was a  paradox. The more he exercised in this excessive fashion, the  stronger he became. While it was true that he thus quite tired  out his night-running Teutonic self, it seemed that he was  merely setting back the fatal day when his strength would be  too much for him and overpower him, and then it would be a  strength more terrible than he had yet known. The other problem  was that of his marriage and of the stratagems he must employ  in order to avoid his wife after dark. And thus, fruitlessly  pondering, he fell asleep.<br><br>    Now, where the huge grizzly bear came from that night was long  a mystery, while the people of the Springs Brothers' Circus,  showing at Sausalito, searched long and vainly for ""Big Ben,  the Biggest Grizzly in Captivity."" But Big Ben escaped, and,  out of the mazes of half a thousand bungalows and country  estates, selected the grounds of James J. Ward for visitation.  The self first Mr. Ward knew was when he found him on his feet,  quivering and tense, a surge of battle in his breast and on his  lips the old war-chant. From without came a wild baying and  bellowing of the hounds. And sharp as a knife-thrust through  the pandemonium came the agony of a stricken dog--his dog, he  knew.<br><br>    Not stopping for slippers, pajama-clad, he burst through the  door Lee Sing had so carefully locked, and sped down the stairs  and out into the night. As his naked feet struck the graveled  driveway, he stopped abruptly, reached under the steps to a  hiding-place he knew well, and pulled forth a huge knotty  club--his old companion on many a mad night adventure on the  hills. The frantic hullabaloo of the dogs was coming nearer,  and, swinging the club, he sprang straight into the thickets to  meet it.<br><br>    The aroused household assembled on the wide veranda. Somebody  turned on the electric lights, but they could see nothing but  one another's frightened faces. Beyond the brightly illuminated  driveway the trees formed a wall of impenetrable blackness. Yet  somewhere in that blackness a terrible struggle was going on.  There was an infernal outcry of animals, a great snarling and  growling, the sound of blows being struck and a smashing and  crashing of underbrush by heavy bodies.<br><br>    The tide of battle swept out from among the trees and upon the  driveway just beneath the onlookers. Then they saw. Mrs.  Gersdale cried out and clung fainting to her son. Lilian,  clutching the railing so spasmodically that a bruising hurt was  left in her finger-ends for days, gazed horror-stricken at a  yellow-haired, wild-eyed giant whom she recognized as the man  who was to be her husband. He was swinging a great club, and  fighting furiously and calmly with a shaggy monster that was  bigger than any bear she had ever seen. One rip of the beast's  claws had dragged away Ward's pajama-coat and streaked his  flesh with blood.<br><br>    While most of Lilian Gersdale's fright was for the man beloved,  there was a large portion of it due to the man himself. Never  had she dreamed so formidable and magnificent a savage lurked  under the starched shirt and conventional garb of her  betrothed. And never had she had any conception of how a man  battled. Such a battle was certainly not modern; nor was she  there beholding a modern man, though she did not know it. For  this was not Mr. James J. Ward, the San Francisco business man,  but one, unnamed and unknown, a crude, rude savage creature  who, by some freak of chance, lived again after thrice a  thousand years.<br><br>    The hounds, ever maintaining their mad uproar, circled about  the fight, or dashed in and out, distracting the bear. When the  animal turned to meet such flanking assaults, the man leaped in  and the club came down. Angered afresh by every such blow, the  bear would rush, and the man, leaping and skipping, avoiding  the dogs, went backwards or circled to one side or the other.  Whereupon the dogs, taking advantage of the opening, would  again spring in and draw the animal's wrath to them.<br><br>    The end came suddenly. Whirling, the grizzly caught a hound  with a wide sweeping cuff that sent the brute, its ribs caved  in and its back broken, hurtling twenty feet. Then the human  brute went mad. A foaming rage flecked the lips that parted  with a wild inarticulate cry, as it sprang in, swung the club  mightily in both hands, and brought it down full on the head of  the uprearing grizzly. Not even the skull of a grizzly could  withstand the crushing force of such a blow, and the animal  went down to meet the worrying of the hounds. And through their  scurrying leaped the man, squarely upon the body, where, in the  white electric light, resting on his club, he chanted a triumph  in an unknown tongue--a song so ancient that Professor Wertz  would have given ten years of his life for it.<br><br>    His guests rushed to possess him and acclaim him, but James  Ward, suddenly looking out of the eyes of the early Teuton, saw  the fair frail Twentieth Century girl he loved, and felt  something snap in his brain. He staggered weakly toward her,  dropped the club, and nearly fell. Something had gone wrong  with him. Inside his brain was an intolerable agony. It seemed  as if the soul of him were flying asunder. Following the  excited gaze of the others, he glanced back and saw the carcass  of the bear. The sight filled him with fear. He uttered a cry  and would have fled, had they not restrained him and led him  into the bungalow.<br><br>      .  .  .   .    .   .<br><br>    James J. Ward is still at the head of the firm of Ward, Knowles  & Co. But he no longer lives in the country; nor does he run of  nights after the coyotes under the moon. The early Teuton in  him died the night of the Mill Valley fight with the bear.  James J. Ward is now wholly James J. Ward, and he shares no  part of his being with any vagabond anachronism from the  younger world. And so wholly is James J. Ward modern, that he  knows in all its bitter fullness the curse of civilized fear.  He is now afraid of the dark, and night in the forest is to him  a thing of abysmal terror. His city house is of the spick and  span order, and he evinces a great interest in burglarproof  devices. His home is a tangle of electric wires, and after  bed-time a guest can scarcely breathe without setting off an  alarm. Also, he had invented a combination keyless door-lock  that travelers may carry in their vest pockets and apply  immediately and successfully under all circumstances. But his  wife does not deem him a coward. She knows better. And, like  any hero, he is content to rest on his laurels. His bravery is  never questioned by those friends who are aware of the Mill  Valley episode.  						                               <br><br>"
50,Yellow Handkerchief,"""I'm not wanting to dictate to you, lad,"" Charley said; ""but I'm  very much against your making a last raid.  You've gone safely  through rough times with rough men, and it would be a shame to have  something happen to you at the very end.""<br><br>    ""But how can I get out of making a last raid?"" I demanded, with the  cocksureness of youth.  ""There always has to be a last, you know,  to anything.""<br><br>    Charley crossed his legs, leaned back, and considered the problem.  ""Very true.  But why not call the capture of Demetrios Contos the  last?  You're back from it safe and sound and hearty, for all your  good wetting, and - and - ""  His voice broke and he could not speak  for a moment.  ""And I could never forgive myself if anything  happened to you now.""<br><br>    I laughed at Charley's fears while I gave in to the claims of his  affection, and agreed to consider the last raid already performed.  We had been together for two years, and now I was leaving the fish  patrol in order to go back and finish my education.  I had earned  and saved money to put me through three years at the high school,  and though the beginning of the term was several months away, I  intended doing a lot of studying for the entrance examinations.<br><br>    My belongings were packed snugly in a sea-chest, and I was all  ready to buy my ticket and ride down on the train to Oakland, when  Neil Partington arrived in Benicia.  The Reindeer was needed  immediately for work far down on the Lower Bay, and Neil said he  intended to run straight for Oakland.  As that was his home and as  I was to live with his family while going to school, he saw no  reason, he said, why I should not put my chest aboard and come  along.<br><br>    So the chest went aboard, and in the middle of the afternoon we  hoisted the Reindeer's big mainsail and cast off.  It was  tantalizing fall weather.  The sea-breeze, which had blown steadily  all summer, was gone, and in its place were capricious winds and  murky skies which made the time of arriving anywhere extremely  problematical.  We started on the first of the ebb, and as we  slipped down the Carquinez Straits, I looked my last for some time  upon Benicia and the bight at Turner's Shipyard, where we had  besieged the Lancashire Queen, and had captured Big Alec, the King  of the Greeks.  And at the mouth of the Straits I looked with not a  little interest upon the spot where a few days before I should have  drowned but for the good that was in the nature of Demetrios  Contos.<br><br>    A great wall of fog advanced across San Pablo Bay to meet us, and  in a few minutes the Reindeer was running blindly through the damp  obscurity.  Charley, who was steering, seemed to have an instinct  for that kind of work.  How he did it, he himself confessed that he  did not know; but he had a way of calculating winds, currents,  distance, time, drift, and sailing speed that was truly marvellous.<br><br>    ""It looks as though it were lifting,"" Neil Partington said, a  couple of hours after we had entered the fog.  ""Where do you say we  are, Charley?""<br><br>    Charley looked at his watch, ""Six o'clock, and three hours more of  ebb,"" he remarked casually.<br><br>    ""But where do you say we are?"" Neil insisted.<br><br>    Charley pondered a moment, and then answered, ""The tide has edged  us over a bit out of our course, but if the fog lifts right now, as  it is going to lift, you'll find we're not more than a thousand  miles off McNear's Landing.""<br><br>    ""You might be a little more definite by a few miles, anyway,"" Neil  grumbled, showing by his tone that he disagreed.<br><br>    ""All right, then,"" Charley said, conclusively, ""not less than a  quarter of a mile, not more than a half.""<br><br>    The wind freshened with a couple of little puffs, and the fog  thinned perceptibly.<br><br>    ""McNear's is right off there,"" Charley said, pointing directly into  the fog on our weather beam.<br><br>    The three of us were peering intently in that direction, when the  Reindeer struck with a dull crash and came to a standstill.  We ran  forward, and found her bowsprit entangled in the tanned rigging of  a short, chunky mast.  She had collided, head on, with a Chinese  junk lying at anchor.<br><br>    At the moment we arrived forward, five Chinese, like so many bees,  came swarming out of the little 'tween-decks cabin, the sleep still  in their eyes.<br><br>    Leading them came a big, muscular man, conspicuous for his pock-  marked face and the yellow silk handkerchief swathed about his  head.  It was Yellow Handkerchief, the Chinaman whom we had  arrested for illegal shrimp-fishing the year before, and who, at  that time, had nearly sunk the Reindeer, as he had nearly sunk it  now by violating the rules of navigation.<br><br>    ""What d'ye mean, you yellow-faced heathen, lying here in a fairway  without a horn a-going?"" Charley cried hotly.<br><br>    ""Mean?"" Neil calmly answered.  ""Just take a look - that's what he  means.""<br><br>    Our eyes followed the direction indicated by Neil's finger, and we  saw the open amidships of the junk, half filled, as we found on  closer examination, with fresh-caught shrimps.  Mingled with the  shrimps were myriads of small fish, from a quarter of an inch  upward in size.<br><br>    Yellow Handkerchief had lifted the trap-net at high-water slack,  and, taking advantage of the concealment offered by the fog, had  boldly been lying by, waiting to lift the net again at low-water  slack.<br><br>    ""Well,"" Neil hummed and hawed, ""in all my varied and extensive  experience as a fish patrolman, I must say this is the easiest  capture I ever made.  What'll we do with them, Charley?""<br><br>    ""Tow the junk into San Rafael, of course,"" came the answer.  Charley turned to me.  ""You stand by the junk, lad, and I'll pass  you a towing line.  If the wind doesn't fail us, we'll make the  creek before the tide gets too low, sleep at San Rafael, and arrive  in Oakland to-morrow by midday.""<br><br>    So saying, Charley and Neil returned to the Reindeer and got under  way, the junk towing astern.  I went aft and took charge of the  prize, steering by means of an antiquated tiller and a rudder with  large, diamond-shaped holes, through which the water rushed back  and forth.<br><br>    By now the last of the fog had vanished, and Charley's estimate of  our position was confirmed by the sight of McNear's Landing a short  half-mile away.  Following along the west shore, we rounded Point  Pedro in plain view of the Chinese shrimp villages, and a great to-  do was raised when they saw one of their junks towing behind the  familiar fish patrol sloop.<br><br>    The wind, coming off the land, was rather puffy and uncertain, and  it would have been more to our advantage had it been stronger.  San  Rafael Creek, up which we had to go to reach the town and turn over  our prisoners to the authorities, ran through wide-stretching  marshes, and was difficult to navigate on a falling tide, while at  low tide it was impossible to navigate at all.  So, with the tide  already half-ebbed, it was necessary for us to make time.  This the  heavy junk prevented, lumbering along behind and holding the  Reindeer back by just so much dead weight.<br><br>    ""Tell those coolies to get up that sail,"" Charley finally called to  me.  ""We don't want to hang up on the mud flats for the rest of the  night.""<br><br>    I repeated the order to Yellow Handkerchief, who mumbled it huskily  to his men.  He was suffering from a bad cold, which doubled him up  in convulsive coughing spells and made his eyes heavy and  bloodshot.  This made him more evil-looking than ever, and when he  glared viciously at me I remembered with a shiver the close shave I  had had with him at the time of his previous arrest.<br><br>    His crew sullenly tailed on to the halyards, and the strange,  outlandish sail, lateen in rig and dyed a warm brown, rose in the  air.  We were sailing on the wind, and when Yellow Handkerchief  flattened down the sheet the junk forged ahead and the tow-line  went slack.  Fast as the Reindeer could sail, the junk outsailed  her; and to avoid running her down I hauled a little closer on the  wind.  But the junk likewise outpointed, and in a couple of minutes  I was abreast of the Reindeer and to windward.  The tow-line had  now tautened, at right angles to the two boats, and the predicament  was laughable.<br><br>    ""Cast off!"" I shouted.<br><br>    Charley hesitated.<br><br>    ""It's all right,"" I added.  ""Nothing can happen.  We'll make the  creek on this tack, and you'll be right behind me all the way up to  San Rafael.""<br><br>    At this Charley cast off, and Yellow Handkerchief sent one of his  men forward to haul in the line.  In the gathering darkness I could  just make out the mouth of San Rafael Creek, and by the time we  entered it I could barely see its banks.  The Reindeer was fully  five minutes astern, and we continued to leave her astern as we  beat up the narrow, winding channel.  With Charley behind us, it  seemed I had little to fear from my five prisoners; but the  darkness prevented my keeping a sharp eye on them, so I transferred  my revolver from my trousers pocket to the side pocket of my coat,  where I could more quickly put my hand on it.<br><br>    Yellow Handkerchief was the one I feared, and that he knew it and  made use of it, subsequent events will show.  He was sitting a few  feet away from me, on what then happened to be the weather side of  the junk.  I could scarcely see the outlines of his form, but I  soon became convinced that he was slowly, very slowly, edging  closer to me.  I watched him carefully.  Steering with my left  hand, I slipped my right into my pocket and got hold of the  revolver.<br><br>    I saw him shift along for a couple of inches, and I was just about  to order him back - the words were trembling on the tip of my  tongue - when I was struck with great force by a heavy figure that  had leaped through the air upon me from the lee side.  It was one  of the crew.  He pinioned my right arm so that I could not withdraw  my hand from my pocket, and at the same time clapped his other hand  over my mouth.  Of course, I could have struggled away from him and  freed my hand or gotten my mouth clear so that I might cry an  alarm, but in a trice Yellow Handkerchief was on top of me.<br><br>    I struggled around to no purpose in the bottom of the junk, while  my legs and arms were tied and my mouth securely bound in what I  afterward found to be a cotton shirt.  Then I was left lying in the  bottom.  Yellow Handkerchief took the tiller, issuing his orders in  whispers; and from our position at the time, and from the  alteration of the sail, which I could dimly make out above me as a  blot against the stars, I knew the junk was being headed into the  mouth of a small slough which emptied at that point into San Rafael  Creek.<br><br>    In a couple of minutes we ran softly alongside the bank, and the  sail was silently lowered.  The Chinese kept very quiet.  Yellow  Handkerchief sat down in the bottom alongside of me, and I could  feel him straining to repress his raspy, hacking cough.  Possibly  seven or eight minutes later I heard Charley's voice as the  Reindeer went past the mouth of the slough.<br><br>    ""I can't tell you how relieved I am,"" I could plainly hear him  saying to Neil, ""that the lad has finished with the fish patrol  without accident.""<br><br>    Here Neil said something which I could not catch, and then  Charley's voice went on:<br><br>    ""The youngster takes naturally to the water, and if, when he  finishes high school, he takes a course in navigation and goes deep  sea, I see no reason why he shouldn't rise to be master of the  finest and biggest ship afloat.""<br><br>    It was all very flattering to me, but lying there, bound and gagged  by my own prisoners, with the voices growing faint and fainter as  the Reindeer slipped on through the darkness toward San Rafael, I  must say I was not in quite the proper situation to enjoy my  smiling future.  With the Reindeer went my last hope.  What was to  happen next I could not imagine, for the Chinese were a different  race from mine, and from what I knew I was confident that fair play  was no part of their make-up.<br><br>    After waiting a few minutes longer, the crew hoisted the lateen  sail, and Yellow Handkerchief steered down toward the mouth of San  Rafael Creek.  The tide was getting lower, and he had difficulty in  escaping the mud-banks.  I was hoping he would run aground, but he  succeeded in making the Bay without accident.<br><br>    As we passed out of the creek a noisy discussion arose, which I  knew related to me.  Yellow Handkerchief was vehement, but the  other four as vehemently opposed him.  It was very evident that he  advocated doing away with me and that they were afraid of the  consequences.  I was familiar enough with the Chinese character to  know that fear alone restrained them.  But what plan they offered  in place of Yellow Handkerchief's murderous one, I could not make  out.<br><br>    My feelings, as my fate hung in the balance, may be guessed.  The  discussion developed into a quarrel, in the midst of which Yellow  Handkerchief unshipped the heavy tiller and sprang toward me.  But  his four companions threw themselves between, and a clumsy struggle  took place for possession of the tiller.  In the end Yellow  Handkerchief was overcome, and sullenly returned to the steering,  while they soundly berated him for his rashness.<br><br>    Not long after, the sail was run down and the junk slowly urged  forward by means of the sweeps.  I felt it ground gently on the  soft mud.  Three of the Chinese - they all wore long sea-boots -  got over the side, and the other two passed me across the rail.  With Yellow Handkerchief at my legs and his two companions at my  shoulders, they began to flounder along through the mud.  After  some time their feet struck firmer footing, and I knew they were  carrying me up some beach.  The location of this beach was not  doubtful in my mind.  It could be none other than one of the Marin  Islands, a group of rocky islets which lay off the Marin County  shore.<br><br>    When they reached the firm sand that marked high tide, I was  dropped, and none too gently.  Yellow Handkerchief kicked me  spitefully in the ribs, and then the trio floundered back through  the mud to the junk.  A moment later I heard the sail go up and  slat in the wind as they drew in the sheet.  Then silence fell, and  I was left to my own devices for getting free.<br><br>    I remembered having seen tricksters writhe and squirm out of ropes  with which they were bound, but though I writhed and squirmed like  a good fellow, the knots remained as hard as ever, and there was no  appreciable slack.  In the course of my squirming, however, I  rolled over upon a heap of clam-shells - the remains, evidently, of  some yachting party's clam-bake.  This gave me an idea.  My hands  were tied behind my back; and, clutching a shell in them, I rolled  over and over, up the beach, till I came to the rocks I knew to be  there.<br><br>    Rolling around and searching, I finally discovered a narrow  crevice, into which I shoved the shell.  The edge of it was sharp,  and across the sharp edge I proceeded to saw the rope that bound my  wrists.  The edge of the shell was also brittle, and I broke it by  bearing too heavily upon it.  Then I rolled back to the heap and  returned with as many shells as I could carry in both hands.  I  broke many shells, cut my hands a number of times, and got cramps  in my legs from my strained position and my exertions.<br><br>    While I was suffering from the cramps, and resting, I heard a  familiar halloo drift across the water.  It was Charley, searching  for me.  The gag in my mouth prevented me from replying, and I  could only lie there, helplessly fuming, while he rowed past the  island and his voice slowly lost itself in the distance.<br><br>    I returned to the sawing process, and at the end of half an hour  succeeded in severing the rope.  The rest was easy.  My hands once  free, it was a matter of minutes to loosen my legs and to take the  gag out of my mouth.  I ran around the island to make sure it was  an island and not by any chance a portion of the mainland.  An  island it certainly was, one of the Marin group, fringed with a  sandy beach and surrounded by a sea of mud.  Nothing remained but  to wait till daylight and to keep warm; for it was a cold, raw  night for California, with just enough wind to pierce the skin and  cause one to shiver.<br><br>    To keep up the circulation, I ran around the island a dozen times  or so, and clambered across its rocky backbone as many times more -  all of which was of greater service to me, as I afterward  discovered, than merely to warm me up.  In the midst of this  exercise I wondered if I had lost anything out of my pockets while  rolling over and over in the sand.  A search showed the absence of  my revolver and pocket-knife.  The first Yellow Handkerchief had  taken; but the knife had been lost in the sand.<br><br>    I was hunting for it when the sound of rowlocks came to my ears.  At first, of course, I thought of Charley; but on second thought I  knew Charley would be calling out as he rowed along.  A sudden  premonition of danger seized me.  The Marin Islands are lonely  places; chance visitors in the dead of night are hardly to be  expected.  What if it were Yellow Handkerchief?  The sound made by  the rowlocks grew more distinct.  I crouched in the sand and  listened intently.  The boat, which I judged a small skiff from the  quick stroke of the oars, was landing in the mud about fifty yards  up the beach.  I heard a raspy, hacking cough, and my heart stood  still.  It was Yellow Handkerchief.  Not to be robbed of his  revenge by his more cautious companions, he had stolen away from  the village and come back alone.<br><br>    I did some swift thinking.  I was unarmed and helpless on a tiny  islet, and a yellow barbarian, whom I had reason to fear, was  coming after me.  Any place was safer than the island, and I turned  instinctively to the water, or rather to the mud.  As he began to  flounder ashore through the mud, I started to flounder out into it,  going over the same course which the Chinese had taken in landing  me and in returning to the junk.<br><br>    Yellow Handkerchief, believing me to be lying tightly bound,  exercised no care, but came ashore noisily.  This helped me, for,  under the shield of his noise and making no more myself than  necessary, I managed to cover fifty feet by the time he had made  the beach.  Here I lay down in the mud.  It was cold and clammy,  and made me shiver, but I did not care to stand up and run the risk  of being discovered by his sharp eyes.<br><br>    He walked down the beach straight to where he had left me lying,  and I had a fleeting feeling of regret at not being able to see his  surprise when he did not find me.  But it was a very fleeting  regret, for my teeth were chattering with the cold.<br><br>    What his movements were after that I had largely to deduce from the  facts of the situation, for I could scarcely see him in the dim  starlight.  But I was sure that the first thing he did was to make  the circuit of the beach to learn if landings had been made by  other boats.  This he would have known at once by the tracks  through the mud.<br><br>    Convinced that no boat had removed me from the island, he next  started to find out what had become of me.  Beginning at the pile  of clamshells, he lighted matches to trace my tracks in the sand.  At such times I could see his villanous face plainly, and, when the  sulphur from the matches irritated his lungs, between the raspy  cough that followed and the clammy mud in which I was lying, I  confess I shivered harder than ever.<br><br>    The multiplicity of my footprints puzzled him.  Then the idea that  I might be out in the mud must have struck him, for he waded out a  few yards in my direction, and, stooping, with his eyes searched  the dim surface long and carefully.  He could not have been more  than fifteen feet from me, and had he lighted a match he would  surely have discovered me.<br><br>    He returned to the beach and clambered about, over the rocky  backbone, again hunting for me with lighted matches, The closeness  of the shave impelled me to further flight.  Not daring to wade  upright, on account of the noise made by floundering and by the  suck of the mud, I remained lying down in the mud and propelled  myself over its surface by means of my hands.  Still keeping the  trail made by the Chinese in going from and to the junk, I held on  until I reached the water.  Into this I waded to a depth of three  feet, and then I turned off to the side on a line parallel with the  beach.<br><br>    The thought came to me of going toward Yellow Handkerchief's skiff  and escaping in it, but at that very moment he returned to the  beach, and, as though fearing the very thing I had in mind, he  slushed out through the mud to assure himself that the skiff was  safe.  This turned me in the opposite direction.  Half swimming,  half wading, with my head just out of water and avoiding splashing,  I succeeded in putting about a hundred feet between myself and the  spot where the Chinese had begun to wade ashore from the junk.  I  drew myself out on the mud and remained lying flat.<br><br>    Again Yellow Handkerchief returned to the beach and made a search  of the island, and again he returned to the heap of clam-shells.  I  knew what was running in his mind as well as he did himself.  No  one could leave or land without making tracks in the mud.  The only  tracks to be seen were those leading from his skiff and from where  the junk had been.  I was not on the island.  I must have left it  by one or the other of those two tracks.  He had just been over the  one to his skiff, and was certain I had not left that way.  Therefore I could have left the island only by going over the  tracks of the junk landing.  This he proceeded to verify by wading  out over them himself, lighting matches as he came along.<br><br>    When he arrived at the point where I had first lain, I knew, by the  matches he burned and the time he took, that he had discovered the  marks left by my body.  These he followed straight to the water and  into it, but in three feet of water he could no longer see them.  On the other hand, as the tide was still falling, he could easily  make out the impression made by the junk's bow, and could have  likewise made out the impression of any other boat if it had landed  at that particular spot.  But there was no such mark; and I knew  that he was absolutely convinced that I was hiding somewhere in the  mud.<br><br>    But to hunt on a dark night for a boy in a sea of mud would be like  hunting for a needle in a haystack, and he did not attempt it.  Instead he went back to the beach and prowled around for some time.  I was hoping he would give me up and go, for by this time I was  suffering severely from the cold.  At last he waded out to his  skiff and rowed away.  What if this departure of Yellow  Handkerchief's were a sham?  What if he had done it merely to  entice me ashore?<br><br>    The more I thought of it the more certain I became that he had made  a little too much noise with his oars as he rowed away.  So I  remained, lying in the mud and shivering.  I shivered till the  muscles of the small of my back ached and pained me as badly as the  cold, and I had need of all my self-control to force myself to  remain in my miserable situation.<br><br>    It was well that I did, however, for, possibly an hour later, I  thought I could make out something moving on the beach.  I watched  intently, but my ears were rewarded first, by a raspy cough I knew  only too well.  Yellow Handkerchief had sneaked back, landed on the  other side of the island, and crept around to surprise me if I had  returned.<br><br>    After that, though hours passed without sign of him, I was afraid  to return to the island at all.  On the other hand, I was almost  equally afraid that I should die of the exposure I was undergoing.  I had never dreamed one could suffer so.  I grew so cold and numb,  finally, that I ceased to shiver.  But my muscles and bones began  to ache in a way that was agony.  The tide had long since begun to  rise, and, foot by foot, it drove me in toward the beach.  High  water came at three o'clock, and at three o'clock I drew myself up  on the beach, more dead than alive, and too helpless to have  offered any resistance had Yellow Handkerchief swooped down upon  me.<br><br>    But no Yellow Handkerchief appeared.  He had given me up and gone  back to Point Pedro.  Nevertheless, I was in a deplorable, not to  say dangerous, condition.  I could not stand upon my feet, much  less walk.  My clammy, muddy garments clung to me like sheets of  ice.  I thought I should never get them off.  So numb and lifeless  were my fingers, and so weak was I, that it seemed to take an hour  to get off my shoes.  I had not the strength to break the porpoise-  hide laces, and the knots defied me.  I repeatedly beat my hands  upon the rocks to get some sort of life into them.  Sometimes I  felt sure I was going to die.<br><br>    But in the end, - after several centuries, it seemed to me, - I got  off the last of my clothes.  The water was now close at hand, and I  crawled painfully into it and washed the mud from my naked body.  Still, I could not get on my feet and walk and I was afraid to lie  still.  Nothing remained but to crawl weakly, like a snail, and at  the cost of constant pain, up and down the sand.  I kept this up as  long as possible, but as the east paled with the coming of dawn I  began to succumb.  The sky grew rosy-red, and the golden rim of the  sun, showing above the horizon, found me lying helpless and  motionless among the clam-shells.<br><br>    As in a dream, I saw the familiar mainsail of the Reindeer as she  slipped out of San Rafael Creek on a light puff of morning air.  This dream was very much broken.  There are intervals I can never  recollect on looking back over it.  Three things, however, I  distinctly remember:  the first sight of the Reindeer's mainsail;  her lying at anchor a few hundred feet away and a small boat  leaving her side; and the cabin stove roaring red-hot, myself  swathed all over with blankets, except on the chest and shoulders,  which Charley was pounding and mauling unmercifully, and my mouth  and throat burning with the coffee which Neil Partington was  pouring down a trifle too hot.<br><br>    But burn or no burn, I tell you it felt good.  By the time we  arrived in Oakland I was as limber and strong as ever, - though  Charlie and Neil Partington were afraid I was going to have  pneumonia, and Mrs. Partington, for my first six months of school,  kept an anxious eye upon me to discover the first symptoms of  consumption.<br><br>    Time flies.  It seems but yesterday that I was a lad of sixteen on  the fish patrol.  Yet I know that I arrived this very morning from  China, with a quick passage to my credit, and master of the  barkentine Harvester.  And I know that to-morrow morning I shall  run over to Oakland to see Neil Partington and his wife and family,  and later on up to Benicia to see Charley Le Grant and talk over  old times.  No; I shall not go to Benicia, now that I think about  it.  I expect to be a highly interested party to a wedding, shortly  to take place.  Her name is Alice Partington, and, since Charley  has promised to be best man, he will have to come down to Oakland  instead.  						                                      <br><br>"
51,After the Winter,"<b>I</b><br><br>Trézinie, the blacksmith's daughter, stepped out upon the gallery just as M'sieur Michel passed by. He did not notice the girl but walked straight on down the village street.<br><br>His seven hounds skulked, as usual, about him. At his side hung his powder-horn, and on his shoulder a gunny-bag slackly filled with game that he carried to the store. A broad felt hat shaded his bearded face and in his hand he carelessly swung his old-fashioned rifle. It was doubtless the same with which he had slain so many people, Trézinie shudderingly reflected. For Cami, the cobbler's son - who must have known - had often related to her how this man had killed two Choctaws, as many Texans, a free mulatto and numberless blacks, in that vague locality known as ""the hills.""<br><br>Older people who knew better took little trouble to correct this ghastly record that a younger generation had scored against him. They themselves had come to half-believe that M'sieur Michel might be capable of anything, living as he had, for so many years, apart from humanity, alone with his hounds in a kennel of a cabin on the hill. The time seemed to most of them fainter than a memory when, a lusty young fellow of twenty-five, he had cultivated his strip of land across the lane from Les Chêniers; when home and toil and wife and child were so many benedictions that he humbly thanked heaven for having given him.<br><br>But in the early '60's he went with his friend Duplan and the rest of the ""Louisiana Tigers."" He came back with some of them. He came to find - well, death may lurk in a peaceful valley lying in wait to ensnare the toddling feet of little ones. Then, there are women - there are wives with thoughts that roam and grow wanton with roaming; women whose pulses are stirred by strange voices and eyes that woo; women who forget the claims of yesterday, the hopes of to-morrow, in the impetuous clutch of to-day.<br><br>But that was no reason, some people thought, why he should have cursed men who found their blessings where they had left them - cursed God, who had abandoned him.<br><br>Persons who met him upon the road had long ago stopped greeting him. What was the use? He never answered them; he spoke to no one; he never so much as looked into men's faces. When he bartered his game and fish at the village store for powder and shot and such scant food as he needed, he did so with few words and less courtesy. Yet feeble as it was, this was the only link that held him to his fellow- beings.<br><br>Strange to say, the sight of M'sieur Michel, though more forbidding than ever that delightful spring afternoon, was so suggestive to Trézinie as to be almost an inspiration.<br><br>It was Easter eve and the early part of April. The whole earth seemed teeming with new, green, vigorous life everywhere - except the arid spot that immediately surrounded Trézinie. It was no use; she had tried. Nothing would grow among those cinders that filled the yard; in that atmosphere of smoke and flame that was constantly belching from the forge where her father worked at his trade. There were wagon wheels, bolts and bars of iron, plowshares and all manner of unpleasant-looking things littering the bleak, black yard; nothing green anywhere except a few weeds that would force themselves into fence corners. And Trézinie knew that flowers belong to Easter time, just as dyed eggs do. She had plenty of eggs; no one had more or prettier ones; she was not going to grumble about that. But she did feel distressed because she had not a flower to help deck the altar on Easter morning. And every one else seemed to have them in such abundance! There was 'Dame Suzanne among her roses across the way. She must have clipped a hundred since noon. An hour ago Trézinie had seen the carriage from Les Chêniers pass by on its way to church with Mamzelle Euphrasie's pretty head looking like a picture enframed with the Easter lilies that filled the vehicle.<br><br>For the twentieth time Trézinie walked out upon the gallery. She saw M'sieur Michel and thought of the pine hill. When she thought of the hill she thought of the flowers that grew there - free as sunshine. The girl gave a joyous spring that changed to a farandole as her feet twinkled across the rough, loose boards of the gallery.<br><br>""He, Cami!"" she cried, clapping her hands together.<br><br>Cami rose from the bench where he sat pegging away at the clumsy sole of a shoe, and came lazily to the fence that divided his abode from Trézinie's.<br><br>""Well, w'at?"" he inquired with heavy amiability. She leaned far over the railing to better communicate with him.<br><br>""You'll go with me yonda on the hill to pick flowers fo' Easter, Cami? I'm goin' to take La Fringante along, too, to he'p with the baskets. W'at you say?""<br><br>""No!"" was the stolid reply. ""I'm boun' to finish them shoe', if it is fo' a nigga.""<br><br>""Not now,"" she returned impatiently; ""tomorrow mo'nin' at sun-up. An' I tell you, Cami, my flowers'll beat all! Look yonda at 'Dame Suzanne pickin' her roses a'ready. An' Mamzelle Euphraisie she's car'ied her lilies an' gone, her. You tell me all that's goin' be fresh to-moro'!""<br><br>""Jus' like you say,"" agreed the boy, turning to resume his work. ""But you want to mine out fo' the ole possum up in the wood. Let M'sieu Michel set eyes on you!"" and he raised his arms as if aiming with a gun. ""Pim, pam, poum! No mo' Trézinie, no mo' Cami, no mo' La Fringante - all stretch'!""<br><br>The possible risk which Cami so vividly foreshadowed but added a zest to Trézinie's projected excursion.<br><br><b>II</b><br><br>It was hardly sun-up on the following morning when the three children - Trézinie, Cami and the little negress, La Fringante - were filling big, flat Indian baskets from the abundance of brilliant flowers that studded the hill.<br><br>In their eagerness they had ascended the slope and penetrated deep into the forest without thought of M'sieur Michel or of his abode. Suddenly, in the dense wood, they came upon his hut - low, forbidding, seeming to scowl rebuke upon them for their intrusion.<br><br>La Fringante dropped her basket, and, with a cry, fled. Cami looked as if he wanted to do the same. But Trézinie, after the first tremor, saw that the ogre himself was away. The wooden shutter of the one window was closed. The door, so low that even a small man must have stooped to enter it, was secured with a chain. Absolute silence reigned, except for the whir of wings in the air, the fitful notes of a bird in the treetop.<br><br>""Can't you see it's nobody there!"" cried Trézinie impatiently.<br><br>La Fringante, distracted between curiosity and terror, had crept cautiously back again. Then they all peeped through the wide chinks between the logs of which the cabin was built.<br><br>M'sieur Michel had evidently begun the construction of his house by felling a huge tree, whose remaining stump stood in the centre of the hut, and served him as a table. This primitive table was worn smooth by twenty-five years of use. Upon it were such humble utensils as the man required. Everything within the hovel, the sleeping bunk, the one seat, were as rude as a savage would have fashioned them.<br><br>The stolid Cami could have stayed for hours with his eyes fastened to the aperture, morbidly seeking some dead, mute sign of that awful pastime with which he believed M'sieur Michel was accustomed to beguile his solitude. But Trézinie was wholly possessed by the thought of her Easter offerings. She wanted flowers and flowers, fresh with the earth and crisp with dew.<br><br>When the three youngsters scampered down the hill again there was not a purple verbena left about M'sieur Michel's hut; not a May apple blossom, not a stalk of crimson phlox - hardly a violet.<br><br>He was something of a savage, feeling that the solitude belonged to him. Of late there had been forming within his soul a sentiment toward man, keener than indifference, bitter as hate. He was coming to dread even that brief intercourse with others into which his traffic forced him.<br><br>So when M'sieur Michel returned to his hut, and with his quick, accustomed eye saw that his woods had been despoiled, rage seized him. It was not that he loved the flowers that were gone more than he loved the stars, or the wind that trailed across the hill, but they belonged to and were a part of that life which he had made for himself, and which he wanted to live alone and unmolested.<br><br>Did not those flowers help him to keep his record of time that was passing? They had no right to vanish until the hot May days were upon him. How else should he know? Why had these people, with whom he had nothing in common, intruded upon his privacy and violated it? What would they not rob him of next?<br><br>He knew well enough it was Easter; he had heard and seen signs yesterday in the store that told him so. And he guessed that his woods had been rifled to add to the mummery of the day.<br><br>M'sieur Michel sat himself moodily down beside his table - centuries old - and brooded. He did not even notice his hounds that were pleading to be fed. As he revolved in his mind the event of the morning - innocent as it was in itself - it grew in importance and assumed a significance not at first apparent. He could not remain passive under pressure of its disturbance. He rose to his feet, every impulse aggressive, urging him to activity. He would go down among those people all gathered together, blacks and whites, and face them for once and all. He did not know what he would say to them, but it would be defiance - something to voice the hate that oppressed him.<br><br>The way down the hill, then across a piece of flat, swampy woodland and through the lane to the village was so familiar that it required no attention from him to follow it. His thoughts were left free to revel in the humor that had driven him from his kennel.<br><br>As he walked down the village street he saw plainly that the place was deserted save for the appearance of an occasional negress, who seemed occupied with preparing the midday meal. But about the church scores of horses were fastened; and M'sieur Michel could see that the edifice was thronged to the very threshold.<br><br>He did not once hesitate, but obeying the force that impelled him to face the people wherever they might be, he was soon standing with the crowd within the entrance of the church. His broad, robust shoulders had forced space for himself, and his leonine head stood higher than any there.<br><br>""Take off yo' hat!""<br><br>It was an indignant mulatto who addressed him. M'sieur Michel instinctively did as he was bidden. He saw confusedly that there was a mass of humanity close to him, whose contact and atmosphere affected him strangely. He saw his wild-flowers, too. He saw them plainly, in bunches and festoons, among the Easter lilies and roses and geraniums. He was going to speak out, now; he had the right to and he would, just as soon as that clamor overhead would cease.<br><br>""Bonté divine! M'sieur Michel!"" whispered 'Dame Suzanne tragically to her neighbor. Trézinie heard. Cami saw. They exchanged an electric glance, and tremblingly bowed their heads low.<br><br>M'sieur Michel looked wrathfully down at the puny mulatto who had ordered him to remove his hat. Why had he obeyed? That initial act of compliance had somehow weakened his will, his resolution. But he would regain firmness just as soon as that clamor above gave him chance to speak.<br><br>It was the organ filling the small edifice with volumes of sound. It was the voices of men and women mingling in the ""Gloria in excelsis Deo!""<br><br>The words bore no meaning for him apart from the old familiar strain which he had known as a child and chanted himself in that same organ-loft years ago. How it went on and on! Would it never cease! It was like a menace; like a voice reaching out from the dead past to taunt him.<br><br>""Gloria in excelsis Deo!"" over and over! How the deep basso rolled it out! How the tenor and alto caught it up and passed it on to be lifted by the high, flute-like ring of the soprano, till all mingled again in the wild paean, ""Gloria in excelsis!""<br><br>How insistent was the refrain! and where, what, was that mysterious, hidden quality in it; the power which was overcoming M'sieur Michel, stirring within him a turmoil that bewildered him?<br><br>There was no use in trying to speak, or in wanting to. His throat could not have uttered a sound. He wanted to escape, that was all. ""Bonæ voluntatis,"" - he bent his head as if before a beating storm. ""Gloria! Gloria! Gloria!"" He must fly; he must save himself, regain his hill where sights and odors and sounds and saints or devils would cease to molest him. ""In excelsis Deo!"" He retreated, forcing his way backward to the door. He dragged his hat down over his eyes and staggered away down the road. But the refrain pursued him - ""Pax! pax! pax!"" - fretting him like a lash. He did not slacken his pace till the tones grew fainter than an echo, floating, dying away in an ""in excelsis!"" When he could hear it no longer he stopped and breathed a sigh of rest and relief.<br><br><b>III</b><br><br>All day long M'sieur Michel stayed about his hut engaged in some familiar employment that he hoped might efface the unaccountable impressions of the morning. But his restlessness was unbounded. A longing had sprung up within him as sharp as pain and not to be appeased. At once, on this bright, warm Easter morning the voices that till now had filled his solitude became meaningless. He stayed mute and uncomprehending before them. Their significance had vanished before the driving want for human sympathy and companionship that had reawakened in his soul.<br><br>When night came on he walked through the woods down the slant of the hill again.<br><br>""It mus' be all fill' up with weeds,"" muttered M'sieur Michel to himself as he went. ""Ah, Bon Dieu! with trees, Michel, with trees - in twenty-five years, man.""<br><br>He had not taken the road to the village, but was pursuing a different one in which his feet had not walked for many days. It led him along the river bank for a distance. The narrow stream, stirred by the restless breeze, gleamed in the moonlight that was flooding the land.<br><br>As he went on and on, the scent of the new- plowed earth that had been from the first keenly perceptible, began to intoxicate him. He wanted to kneel and bury his face in it. He wanted to dig into it; turn it over. He wanted to scatter the seed again as he had done long ago, and watch the new, green life spring up as if at his bidding.<br><br>When he turned away from the river, and had walked a piece down the lane that divided Joe Duplan's plantation from that bit of land that had once been his, he wiped his eyes to drive away the mist that was making him see things as they surely could not be.<br><br>He had wanted to plant a hedge that time before he went away, but he had not done so. Yet there was the hedge before him, just as he had meant it to be, and filling the night with fragrance. A broad, low gate divided its length, and over this he leaned and looked before him in amazement. There were no weeds as he had fancied; no trees except the scattered live oaks that he remembered.<br><br>Could that row of hardy fig trees, old, squat and gnarled, be the twigs that he himself had set one day into the ground? One raw December day when there was a fine, cold mist falling. The chill of it breathed again upon him; the memory was so real. The land did not look as if it ever had been plowed for a field. It was a smooth, green meadow, with cattle huddled upon the cool sward, or moving with slow, stately tread as they nibbled the tender shoots.<br><br>There was the house unchanged, gleaming white in the moon, seeming to invite him beneath its calm shelter. He wondered who dwelt within it now. Whoever it was he would not have them find him, like a prowler, there at the gate. But he would come again and again like this at nighttime, to gaze and refresh his spirit.<br><br>A hand had been laid upon M'sieur Michel's shoulder and some one called his name. Startled, he turned to see who accosted him.<br><br>""Duplan!""<br><br>The two men who had not exchanged speech for so many years stood facing each other for a long moment in silence.<br><br>""I knew you would come back some day, Michel. It was a long time to wait, but you have come home at last.""<br><br>M'sieur Michel cowered instinctively and lifted his hands with expressive deprecatory gesture. ""No, no; it's no place for me, Joe; no place!""<br><br>""Isn't a man's home a place for him, Michel?"" It seemed less a question than an assertion, charged with gentle authority.<br><br>""Twenty-five years, Duplan; twenty-five years! It's no use; it's too late.""<br><br>""You see, I have used it,"" went on the planter, quietly, ignoring M'sieur Michel's protestations. ""Those are my cattle grazing off there. The house has served me many a time to lodge guests or workmen, for whom I had no room at Les Chêniers. I have not exhausted the soil with any crops. I had not the right to do that. Yet am I in your debt, Michel, and ready to settle en bon ami.""<br><br>The planter had opened the gate and entered the inclosure, leading M'sieur Michel with him. Together they walked toward the house.<br><br>Language did not come readily to either - one so unaccustomed to hold intercourse with men; both so stirred with memories that would have rendered any speech painful. When they had stayed long in a silence which was eloquent of tenderness, Joe Duplan spoke:<br><br>""You know how I tried to see you, Michel, to speak with you, and- you never would.""<br><br>M'sieur Michel answered with but a gesture that seemed a supplication.<br><br>""Let the past all go, Michel. Begin your new life as if the twenty-five years that are gone had been a long night, from which you have only awakened. Come to me in the morning,"" he added with quick resolution, ""for a horse and a plow."" He had taken the key of the house from his pocket and placed it in M'sieur Michel's hand.<br><br>""A horse?"" M'sieur Michel repeated uncertainly; ""a plow! Oh, it's too late, Duplan; too late.""<br><br>""It isn't too late. The land has rested all these years, man; it's fresh, I tell you; and rich as gold. Your crop will be the finest in the land."" He held out his hand and M'sieur Michel pressed it without a word in reply, save a muttered ""Mon ami.""<br><br>Then he stood there watching the planter disappear behind the high, clipped hedge.<br><br>He held out his arms. He could not have told if it was toward the retreating figure, or in welcome to an infinite peace that seemed to descend upon him and envelop him.<br><br>All the land was radiant except the hill far off that was in black shadow against the sky.<br><br>"
52,A Little Country Girl,"Ninette was scouring the tin milk-pail with sand and lye-soap, and bringing it to a high polish. She used for that purpose the native scrub-brush, the fibrous root of the palmetto, which she called <i>latanier</i>. The long table on which the tins were ranged, stood out in the yard under a mulberry tree. It was there that the pots and kettles were washed, the chickens, the meats and vegetables cut up and prepared for cooking.<br><br>It was all because two disagreeable old people, who had long outlived their youth, no longer believed in the circus as a means of cheering the human heart; nor could they see the use of it.<br><br>Ninette had not even mentioned the subject to them. Why should she? She might as well have said: “Grandfather and Grandmother, with your permission and a small advance, I should like, after my work is done, to make a visit to one of the distant planets this afternoon.”<br><br>It was very warm and Ninette’s face was red with heat and ill-humor. Her hair was black and straight and kept falling over her face. It was an untidy length; her grandmother having decided to let it grow, about six months before. She was barefooted and her calico skirt reached a little above her thick, brown ankles.<br><br>Even the negroes were all going to the circus. Suzan’s daughter, who was known as Black-Gal, had lingered beside the table a moment on her way through the yard.<br><br>“You ain’t gwine to de suckus?” she inquired with condescension.<br><br>“No,” and bread-pan went bang on the table.<br><br>“We all’s goin’. Pap an’ Mammy an’ all us is goin’,” with a complacent air and a restful pose against the table.<br><br>“Where you all goin’ to get the money, I like to know.”<br><br>“Oh, Mr. Ben advance’ Mammy a dollar on de crap; an’ Joe, he got six bits lef’ f’om las’ pickin’; an’ pap sole a ole no’ count plow to Dennis. We all’s goin’.<br><br>“Joe say he seed ‘em pass yonder back Mr. Ben’s lane. Dey a elephant mos’ as big as dat corn-crib, walkin’ long des like he somebody. An’ a whole pa’cel wild critters shet up in a cage. An’ all kind o’ dogs an’ hosses; an’ de ladies rarin’ an’ pitchin’ in red skirts all fill’ up wid gole an’ diamonds.<br><br>“We all’s goin’. Did you ax yo’ gran’ma? How come you don’t ax yo’ gran’pap?”<br><br>“That’s my business; ‘tain’t none o’ yo’s, Black-Gal. You better be gettin’ yonder home, tendin’ to yo’ work, I think.”<br><br>“I ain’t got no work, ‘cep’ iron out my pink flounce’ dress fo’ de suckus.” But she took herself off with an air of lofty contempt, swinging her tattered skirts. It was after that that Ninette’s tears began to drop and spatter. Resentment rose and rose within her like a leaven, causing her to ferment with wickedness and to make all manner of diabolical wishes in regard to the circus. The worst of these was that she wished it would rain.<br><br>“I hope to goodness it’ll po’ down rain; po’ down rain; po’ down rain!” She uttered the wish with the air of a young Medusa pronouncing a blighting curse.<br><br>“I like to see ‘em all drippin’ wet. Black-Gal with her pink flounces, all drippin’ wet.” She spoke these wishes in the very presence of her grandfather and grandmother, for they understood not a word of English; and she used that language to express her individual opinion on many occasions.<br><br>“What do you say, Ninette?” asked her grandmother. Ninette had brought in the last of the tin pails and was ranging them on a shelf in the kitchen.<br><br>“I said I hoped it would rain,” she answered, wiping her face and fanning herself with a pie pan as though the oppressive heat had suggested the desire for a change of weather.<br><br>“You are a wicked girl,” said her grandmother, turning on her, “when you know your grandfather has acres and acres of cotton ready to fall, that the rain would ruin. He’s angry enough, too, with every man, woman and child leaving the fields to-day to take themselves off to the village. There ought to be a law to compel them to pick their cotton; those trifling creatures! Ah! it was different in the good old days.”<br><br>Ninette possessed a sensitive soul, and she believed in miracles. For instance, if she were to go to the circus that afternoon she would consider it a miracle. Hope follows on the heels of Faith. And the white-winged goddess – which is Hope – did not leave her, but prompted her to many little surreptitious acts of preparation in the event of the miracle coming to pass.<br><br>She peeped into the clothes-press to see that her gingham dress was where she had folded and left it the Sunday before, after Mass. She inspected her shoes and got out a clean pair of stockings which she hid beneath the pillow. In the tin basin behind the house, she scrubbed her face and neck till they were red as a boiled crawfish. And her hair, which was too short to plait, she plastered and tied back with a green ribbon; it stood out in a little bristling, stiff tail.<br><br>The noon hour had hardly passed, than an unusual agitation began to be visible throughout the surrounding country. The fields were deserted. People, black and white, began passing along the road in squads and detachments. Ponies were galloping on both sides of the river, carrying two and as many as three, on their backs. Blue and green carts with rampant mules; top-buggies and no-top buggies; family carriages that groaned with age and decrepitude; heavy wagons filled with piccaninnies made a passing procession that nothing short of a circus in town could have accounted for.<br><br>Grandfather Bézeau was too angry to look at it. He retired to the hall, where he sat gloomily reading a two-weeks-old paper. He looked about ninety years old; he was in reality, not more than seventy.<br><br>Grandmother Bézeau stayed out on the gallery, apparently to cast ridicule and contempt upon the heedless and extravagant multitude; in reality, to satisfy a womanly curiosity and a natural interest in the affairs of her neighbors.<br><br>As for Ninette, she found it difficult to keep her attention fixed upon her task of shelling peas and her inward supplications that something might happen.<br><br>Something did happen. Jules Perrault, with a family load in his big farm-wagon, stopped before their gate. He handed the reins to one of the children and he, himself, got down and came up to the gallery where Ninette and her grandmother were sitting.<br><br>“What’s this! what’s this!”he cried out in French, “Ninette not going to the circus? not even ready to go?”<br><br><i>“Par example!”</i> exclaimed the old lady, looking daggers over her spectacles. She was binding the leg of a wounded chicken that squawked and fluttered with terror.<br><br>“<i>’Par example’</i> or no <i>‘par example’</i> she’s going and she’s going with me; and her grandfather will give her the money. Run in, little one; get ready; make haste, we shall be late.” She looked appealingly at her grandmother who said nothing, being ashamed to say what she felt in the face of her neighbor, Perrault, of whom she stood a little in awe. Ninette, taking silence for consent, darted into the house to get ready.<br><br>And when she came out, wonder of wonders! There was her grandfather taking his purse from his pocket. He was drawing it out slowly and painfully, with a hideous grimace, as though it were some vital organ that he was extracting. What arguments could Mons. Perrault have used! They were surely convincing. Ninette had heard them in wordy discussion as she nervously laced her shoes; dabbed her face with flour; hooked the gingham dress; and balanced upon her head a straw “flat” whose roses looked as though they had stayed out over night in a frost. But no triumphant queen on her throne could have presented a more beaming and joyful countenance than did Ninette when she ascended and seated herself in the big wagon in the midst of Perrault family. She at once took the baby from Mme. Perrault and held it and felt supremely happy.<br><br>The more the wagon jolted and bounced, the more did it convey to her a sense of reality; and less did it seem like a dream. They passed Black-Gal and her family in the road, trudging ankle-deep in dust. Fortunately the girl was barefooted; though the pink flounces were all there, and she carried a green parasol. Her mother was <i>semi-décolletée</i> and her father wore a heavy winter coat; while Joe had secured piece-meal, a species of cake-walk costume for the occasion. It was with a feeling of lofty disdain that Ninette passed and left the Black-Gal family in a cloud of dust.<br><br>Even after they reached the circus grounds, which were just outside the village, Ninette continued to carry the baby. She would willingly have carried three babies, had such a thing been possible. The infant took a wild and noisy interest in the merry-go-round with its hurdy-gurdy accompaniment. Oh! that she had had more money! that she might have mounted one of those flying horses and gone spinning round in a whirl of ecstasy!<br><br>There were side-shows, too. She would have liked to see the lady who weighed six hundred pounds and the gentleman who tipped the scales at fifty. She would have wanted to peep in at the curious monster, captured after a desperate struggle in the wilds of Africa. Its picture, in red and green on the flapping canvas, was surely not like anything she had ever seen of even heard of.<br><br>The lemonade was tempting: the pop-corn, the peanuts, the oranges were delights that she might only gaze upon and sigh for. Mons. Perrault took them straight to the big tent, bought the tickets and entered.<br><br>Ninette’s pulses were thumping with excitement. She sniffed the air, heavy with the smell of saw-dust and animals, and it lingered in her nostrils like some delicious odor. Sure enough! There was the elephant which Black-Gal had described. A chain was about his ponderous leg and he kept reaching out his trunk for tempting morsels. The wild creatures were all there in cages, and the people walked solemnly around, looking at them; awed by the unfamiliarity of the scene.<br><br>Ninette never forgot that she had the baby in her arms. She talked to it, and it listened and looked with round, staring eyes. Later on she felt as if she were a person of distinction assisting at some royal pageant when the be-spangled Knights and Ladies in plumes and flowing robes went prancing round on their beautiful horses.<br><br>The people all sat on the circus benches and Ninette’s feet hung down, because an irritable old lady objected to having them thrust into the small of her back. Mme. Perrault offered to take the baby, but Ninette clung to it. It was something to which she might communicate her excitement. She squeezed it spasmodically when her emotions became uncontrollable.<br><br>“Oh! <i>bébé</i>! I believe I’m goin’ to split my sides! Oh, la! la! if gran’ma could see that, I know she’d laugh herse’f sick.” It was none other than the clown who was producing this agreeable impression upon Ninette. She had only to look at his chalky face to go into contortions of mirth.<br><br>No one had noticed a gathering obscurity, and the ominous growl of thunder made every one start with disappointment or apprehension. A flash and a second clap, that was like a crash, followed. It came just as the ring-master was cracking his whip with a “hip-la! hip-la!” at the bareback rider, and the clown was standing on his head. There was a sinister roar; a terrific stroke of the wind; the center pole swayed and snapped; the great canvas swelled and beat the air with bellowing resistance.<br><br>Pandemonium reigned. In the confusion Ninette found herself down beneath piled up benches. Still clutching the baby, she proceeded to crawl out of an opening in the canvas. She stayed huddled up against the fallen tent, thinking her end had come, while the baby shrieked lustily.<br><br>The rain poured in sheets. The cries and howls of the frightened animals were like unearthly sounds. Men called and shouted; children screamed; women went into hysterics and the negroes were having fits.<br><br>Ninette got on her knees and prayed God to keep her and the baby and everyone from injury and to take them safely home. It was thus that Mons. Perrault discovered her and the baby, half covered by the fallen tent.<br><br>When her condition began to grow monotonous and depressing, her grandmother insisted upon knowing the cause of it. Then it was that she confessed her wickedness and claimed the guilt of having caused the terrible catastrophe at the circus.<br><br>It was her fault that a horse had been killed; it was her fault if an old gentleman had had a collar-bone broken and a lady an arm dislocated. She was the cause of several persons having been thrown into fits and hysterics. All her fault! She it was who had called rain down upon their heads and thus had she been punished!<br><br>It was a very delicate matter for grandmother Bézeau to pronounce upon – far too delicate. So the next day she went and explained it all to the priest and got him to come over and talk to Ninette.<br><br>The girl was at the table under the mulberry tree peeling potatoes when the priest arrived. He was a jolly little man who did not like to take things too seriously. So he advanced over the short, tufted grass, bowling low to the ground and making deep salutations with his hat.<br><br>“I am overwhelmed,” he said, “at finding myself in the presence of the wonderful Magician! who has but to call upon the rain and down it comes. She whistles for the wind and – there it is! Pray, what weather will you give us this afternoon, fair Sorceress?” Then he became serious and frowning, straightened himself and rapped his stick upon the table. “What foolishness is this I hear? look at me; look at me!” for she was covering her face, “and who are you, I should like to know, that you dare think you can control the elements!”<br><br>Well, they made a great deal of fuss of Ninette and she felt ashamed.<br><br>But Mons. Perrault came over; he understood best of all. He took grandmother and grandfather aside and told them that the girl was morbid from staying so much with old people, and never associating with those of her own age. He was very impressive and convincing. He frightened them, for he hinted vaguely at terrible consequences to the child’s intellect.<br><br>He must have touched their hearts, for they both consented to let her go to a birthday party over at his house the following day. Grandfather Bézeau even declared that <i>if it was necessary</i> he would contribute towards providing her with a suitable toilet for the occasion.<br><br>"
53,A Night in Acadie,"  THERE was nothing to do on the plantation so Telèsphore, having a few dollars in his pocket, thought he would go down and spend Sunday in the vicinity of Marksville.  <br><br>  There was really nothing more to do in the vicinity of Marksville than in the neighborhood of his own small farm; but Elvina would not be down there, nor Amaranthe, nor any of Ma'me Valtour's daughters to harass him with doubt, to torture him with indecision, to turn his very soul into a weather-cock for love's fair winds to play with.  <br><br>  Telèsphore at twenty-eight had long felt the need of a wife. His home without one was like an empty temple in which there is no altar, no offering. So keenly did he realize the necessity that a dozen times at least during the past year he had been on the point of proposing marriage to almost as many different young women of the neighborhood. Therein lay the difficulty, the trouble which Telèsphore experienced in making up his mind. Elvina's eyes were beautiful and had often tempted him to the verge of a declaration. But her skin was over swarthy for a wife; and her movements were slow and heavy; he doubted she had Indian blood, and we all know what Indian blood is for treachery. Amaranthe presented in her person none of these obstacles to matrimony. If her eyes were not so handsome as Elvina's, her skin was fine, and being slender to a fault, she moved swiftly about her household affairs, or when she walked the country lanes in going to church or to the store. Telèsphore had once reached the point of believing that Amaranthe would make him an excellent wife. He had even started out one day with the intention of declaring himself, when, as the god of chance would have it, Ma'me Valtour espied him passing in the road and enticed him to enter and partake of coffee and ""baignés."" He would have been a man of stone to have resisted, or to have remained insensible to the charms and accomplishments of the Valtour girls. Finally there was Ganache's widow, seductive rather than handsome, with a good bit of property in her own right. While Telèsphore was considering his chances of happiness or even success with Ganache's widow, she married a younger man.  <br><br>  From these embarrassing conditions, Telèsphore sometimes felt himself forced to escape; to change his environment for a day or two and thereby gain a few new insights by shifting his point of view.  <br><br>  It was Saturday morning that he decided to spend Sunday in the vicinity of Marksville, and the same afternoon found him waiting at the country station for the south-bound train.  <br><br>  He was a robust young fellow with good, strong features and a somewhat determined expression - despite his vacillations in the choice of a wife. He was dressed rather carefully in navy-blue ""store clothes"" that fitted well because anything would have fitted Telèsphore. He had been freshly shaved and trimmed and carried an umbrella. He wore - a little tilted over one eye - a straw hat in preference to the conventional gray felt; for no other reason than that his uncle Telèsphore would have worn a felt, and a battered one at that. His whole conduct of life had been planned on lines in direct contradistinction to those of his uncle Telèsphore, whom he was thought in early youth to greatly resemble. The elder Telèsphore could not read nor write, therefore the younger had made it the object of his existence to acquire these accomplishments. The uncle pursued the avocations of hunting, fishing and moss-picking; employments which the nephew held in detestation. And as for carrying an umbrella, ""Nonc"" Telèsphore would have walked the length of the parish in a deluge before he would have so much as thought of one. In short, Telèsphore, by advisedly shaping his course in direct opposition to that of his uncle, managed to lead a rather orderly, industrious, and respectable existence.  <br><br>  It was a little warm for April but the car was not uncomfortably crowded and Telèsphore was fortunate enough to secure the last available window-seat on the shady side. He was not too familiar with railway travel, his expeditions being usually made on horse-back or in a buggy, and the short trip promised to interest him.  <br><br>  There was no one present whom he knew well enough to speak to: the district attorney, whom he knew by sight, a French priest from Natchitoches and a few faces that were familiar only because they were native.  <br><br>  But he did not greatly care to speak to anyone. There was a fair stand of cotton and corn in the fields and Telèsphore gathered satisfaction in silent contemplation of the crops, comparing them with his own.  <br><br>  It was toward the close of his journey that a young girl boarded the train. There had been girls getting on and off at intervals and it was perhaps because of the bustle attending her arrival that this one attracted Telèsphore's attention.  <br><br>  She called good-bye to her father from the platform and waved good-bye to him through the dusty, sun-lit window pane after entering, for she was compelled to seat herself on the sunny side. She seemed inwardly excited and preoccupied save for the attention which she lavished upon a large parcel that she carried religiously and laid reverentially down upon the seat before her.  <br><br>  She was neither tall nor short, nor stout nor slender; nor was she beautiful, nor was she plain. She wore a figured lawn, cut a little low in the back, that exposed a round, soft nuque with a few little clinging circlets of soft, brown hair. Her hat was of white straw, cocked up on the side with a bunch of pansies, and she wore gray lisle-thread gloves. The girl seemed very warm and kept mopping her face. She vainly sought her fan, then she fanned herself with her handkerchief, and finally made an attempt to open the window. She might as well have tried to move the banks of Red river.  <br><br>  Telèsphore had been unconsciously watching her the whole time and perceiving her straight he arose and went to her assistance. But the window could not be opened. When he had grown red in the face and wasted an amount of energy that would have driven the plow for a day, he offered her his seat on the shady side. She demurred - there would be no room for the bundle. He suggested that the bundle be left where it was and agreed to assist her in keeping an eye upon it. She accepted Telèsphore's place at the shady window and he seated himself beside her.  <br><br>  He wondered if she would speak to him. He feared she might have mistaken him for a Western drummer, in which event he knew that she would not; for the women of the country caution their daughters against speaking to strangers on the trains. But the girl was not one to mistake an Acadian farmer for a Western traveling man. She was not born in Avoyelles parish for nothing.  <br><br>  ""I wouldn' want anything to happen to it,"" she said.  <br><br>  ""It's all right w'ere it is,"" he assured her, following the direction of her glance, that was fastened upon the bundle.  <br><br>  ""The las' time I came over to Foché's ball I got caught in the rain on my way up to my cousin's house, an' my dress! J' vous réponds! it was a sight. Li'le mo', I would miss the ball. As it was, the dress looked like I'd wo' it weeks without doin'-up.""  <br><br>  ""No fear of rain to-day,"" he reassured her, glancing out at the sky, ""but you can have my umbrella if it does rain; you jus' as well take it as not.""  <br><br>  ""Oh, no! I wrap' the dress roun' in toileciree this time. You goin' to Foché's ball?  <br><br>  Didn' I meet you once yonda on Bayou Derbanne? Looks like I know yo' face. You mus' come f'om Natchitoches pa'ish.""  <br><br>  ""My cousins, the Fédeau family, live yonda. Me, I live on my own place in Rapides since '92.""  <br><br>  He wondered if she would follow up her inquiry relative to Foché's ball. If she did, he was ready with an answer, for he had decided to go to the ball. But her thoughts evidently wandered from the subject and were occupied with matters that did not concern him, for she turned away and gazed silently out of the window.  <br><br>  It was not a village; it was not even a hamlet at which they descended. The station was set down upon the edge of a cotton field. Near at hand was the post office and store; there was a section house; there were a few cabins at wide intervals, and one in the distance the girl informed him was the home of her cousin, Jules Trodon. There lay a good bit of road before them and she did not hesitate to accept Telèsphore's offer to bear her bundle on the way.  <br><br>  She carried herself boldly and stepped out freely and easily, like a negress. There was an absence of reserve in her manner; yet there was no lack of womanliness. She had the air of a young person accustomed to decide for herself and for those about her.  <br><br>  ""You said yo' name was Fédeau?"" she asked, looking squarely at Telèsphore. Her eyes were penetrating - not sharply penetrating, but earnest and dark, and a little searching. He noticed that they were handsome eyes; not so large as Elvina's, but finer in their expression. They started to walk down the track before turning into the lane leading to Trodon's house. The sun was sinking and the air was fresh and invigorating by contrast with the stifling atmosphere of the train.  <br><br>  ""You said yo' name was Fédeau?"" she asked.  <br><br>  ""No,"" he returned. ""My name is Telèsphore Baquette.""  <br><br>  ""An' my name; it's Zaïda Trodon. It looks like you ought to know me; I don' know w'y.""  <br><br>  ""It looks that way to me, somehow,"" he replied. They were satisfied to recognize this feeling - almost conviction - of pre-acquaintance, without trying to penetrate its cause.  <br><br>  By the time they reached Trodon's house he knew that she lived over on Bayou de Glaize with her parents and a number of younger brothers and sisters. It was rather dull where they lived and she often came to lend a hand when her cousin's wife got tangled in domestic complications; or, as she was doing now, when Foché's Saturday ball promised to be unusually important and brilliant. There would be people there even from Marksville, she thought; there were often gentlemen from Alexandria. Telèsphore was as unreserved as she, and they appeared like old acquaintances when they reached Trodon's gate.  <br><br>  Trodon's wife was standing on the gallery with a baby in her arms, watching for Zaïda; and four little bare-footed children were sitting in a row on the step, also waiting; but terrified and struck motionless and dumb at sight of a stranger. He opened the gate for the girl but stayed outside himself. Zaïda presented him formally to her cousin's wife, who insisted upon his entering.  <br><br>  ""Ah, b'en, pour ça! you got to come in. It's any sense you goin' to walk yonda to Foché's! Ti Jules, run call yo' pa."" As if Ti Jules could have run or walked even, or moved a muscle!  <br><br>  But Telèsphore was firm. He drew forth his silver watch and looked at it in a business-like fashion. He always carried a watch; his uncle Telèsphore always told the time by the sun, or by instinct, like an animal. He was quite determined to walk on to Foché's, a couple of miles away, where he expected to secure supper and a lodging, as well as the pleasing distraction of the ball.  <br><br>  ""Well, I reckon I see you all to-night,"" he uttered in cheerful anticipation as he moved away.  <br><br>  ""You'll see Zaïda; yes, an' Jules,"" called out Trodon's wife good-humoredly. ""Me, I got no time to fool with balls, J' vous réponds! with all them chil'ren.""  <br><br>  ""He's good-lookin'; yes,"" she exclaimed, when Telèsphore was out of ear-shot. ""An' dressed! it's like a prince. I didn' know you knew any Baquettes, you, Zaïda.""  <br><br>  ""It's strange you don' know 'em yo' se'f, cousine."" Well, there had been no question from Ma'me Trodon, so why should there be an answer from Zaïda?  <br><br>  Telèsphore wondered as he walked why he had not accepted the invitation to enter. He was not regretting it; he was simply wondering what could have induced him to decline. For it surely would have been agreeable to sit there on the gallery waiting while Zaïda prepared herself for the dance; to have partaken of supper with the family and afterward accompanied them to Foché's. The whole situation was so novel, and had presented itself so unexpectedly that Telèsphore wished in reality to become acquainted with it, accustomed to it. He wanted to view it from this side and that in comparison with other, familiar situations. The girl had impressed him - affected him in some way; but in some new, unusual way, not as the others always had. He could not recall details of her personality as he could recall such details of Amaranthe or the Valtours, of any of them. When Telèsphore tried to think of her he could not think at all. He seemed to have absorbed her in some way and his brain was not so occupied with her as his senses were. At that moment he was looking forward to the ball; there was no doubt about that. Afterwards, he did not know what he would look forward to; he did not care; afterward made no difference. If he had expected the crash of doom to come after the dance at Foché's, he would only have smiled in his thankfulness that it was not to come before.  <br><br>  There was the same scene every Saturday at Foché's! A scene to have aroused the guardians of the peace in a locality where such commodities abound. And all on account of the mammoth pot of gumbo that bubbled, bubbled, bubbled out in the open air. Foché in shirt-sleeves, fat, red and enraged, swore and reviled, and stormed at old black Douté for her extravagance. He called her every kind of a name of every kind of animal that suggested itself to his lurid imagination. And every fresh invective that he fired at her she hurled it back at him while into the pot went the chickens and the pans-full of minced ham, and the fists-full of onion and sage and piment rouge and piment vert. If he wanted her to cook for pigs he had only to say so. She knew how to cook for pigs and she knew how to cook for people of les Avoyelles.  <br><br>  The gumbo smelled good, and Telèsphore would have liked a taste of it. Douté was dragging from the fire a stick of wood that Foché had officiously thrust beneath the simmering pot, and she muttered as she hurled it smouldering to one side:  <br><br>  ""Vaux mieux y s'méle ces affairs, lui; si non!"" But she was all courtesy as she dipped a steaming plate for Telèsphore; though she assured him it would not be fit for a Christian or a gentleman to taste till midnight.  <br><br>  Telèsphore having brushed, ""spruced"" and refreshed himself, strolled about, taking a view of the surroundings. The house, big, bulky and weather-beaten, consisted chiefly of galleries in every stage of decrepitude and dilapidation. There were a few chinaberry trees and a spreading live oak in the yard. Along the edge of the fence, a good distance away. was a line of gnarled and distorted mulberry trees; and it was there, out in the road, that the people who came to the ball tied their ponies, their wagons and carts.  <br><br>  Dusk was beginning to fall and Telèsphore, looking out across the prairie, could see them coming from all directions. The little Creole ponies galloping in a line looked like hobby horses in the faint distance; the mule-carts were like toy wagons. Zaïda might be among those people approaching, flying, crawling ahead of the darkness that was creeping out of the far wood. He hoped so, but he did not believe so; she would hardly have had time to dress.  <br><br>  Foché was noisily lighting lamps, with the assistance of an inoffensive mulatto boy whom he intended in the morning to butcher, to cut into sections, to pack and salt down in a barrel, like the Colfax woman did to her old husband - a fitting destiny for so stupid a pig as the mulatto boy. The negro musicians had arrived: two fiddlers and an accordion player, and they were drinking whiskey from a black quart bottle which was passed socially from one to the other. The musicians were really never at their best till the quart bottle had been consumed.  <br><br>  The girls who came in wagons and on ponies from a distance wore, for the most part, calico dresses and sun-bonnets. Their finery they brought along in pillow-slips or pinned up in sheets and towels. With these they at once retired to an upper room; later to appear be-ribboned and be-furbelowed; their faces masked with starch powder, but never a touch of rouge.  <br><br>  Most of the guests had assembled when Zaïda arrived - ""dashed up"" would better express her coming - in an open, two-seated buckboard, with her cousin Jules driving. He reined the pony suddenly and viciously before the time-eaten front steps, in order to produce an impression upon those who were gathered around. Most of the men had halted their vehicles outside and permitted their women folk to walk up from the mulberry trees.  <br><br>  But the real, the stunning effect was produced when Zaïda stepped upon the gallery and threw aside her light shawl in the full glare of half a dozen kerosene lamps. She was white from head to foot - literally, for her slippers even were white. No one would have believed, let alone suspected that they were a pair of old black ones which she had covered with pieces of her first communion sash. There is no describing her dress, it was fluffy, like a fresh powder-puff, and stood out. No wonder she had handled it so reverentially! Her white fan was covered with spangles that she herself had sewed all over it; and in her belt and in her brown hair were thrust small sprays of orange blossom.  <br><br>  Two men leaning against the railing uttered long whistles expressive equally of wonder and admiration.  <br><br>  ""Tiens! t'es pareille comme ain mariée, Zaïda;"" cried out a lady with a baby in her arms. Some young women tittered and Zaïda fanned herself. The women's voices were almost without exception shrill and piercing; the men's, soft and low-pitched.  <br><br>  The girl turned to Telèsphore, as to an old and valued friend:  <br><br>  ""Tiens! c'est vous?"" He had hesitated at first to approach, but at this friendly sign of recognition he drew eagerly forward and held out his hand. The men looked at him suspiciously, inwardly resenting his stylish appearance, which they considered instrusive, offensive and demoralizing.  <br><br>  How Zaïda's eyes sparkled now! What very pretty teeth Zaïda had when she laughed, and what a mouth! Her lips were a revelation, a promise; something to carry away and remember in the night and grow hungry thinking of next day. Strictly speaking, they may not have been quite all that; but in any event, that is the way Telèsphore thought about them. He began to take account of her appearance: her nose, her eyes, her hair. And when she left him to go in and dance her first dance with cousin Jules, he leaned up against a post and thought of them: nose, eyes, hair, ears, lips and round, soft throat.  <br><br>  Later it was like Bedlam.  <br><br>  The musicians had warmed up and were scraping away indoors and calling the figures. Feet were pounding through the dance; dust was flying. The women's voices were piped high and mingled discordantly, like the confused, shrill clatter of waking birds, while the men laughed boisterously. But if some one had only thought of gagging Foché, there would have been less noise. His good humor permeated everywhere, like an atmosphere. He was louder than all the noise; he was more visible than the dust. He called the young mulatto (destined for the knife) ""my boy"" and sent him flying hither and thither. He beamed upon Douté as he tasted the gumbo and congratulated her: ""C'est toi qui s'y connais, ma fille! 'cré tonnerre!""  <br><br>  Telèsphore danced with Zaïda and then he leaned out against the post; then he danced with Zaïda, and then he leaned against the post. The mothers of the other girls decided that he had the manners of a pig.  <br><br>  It was time to dance again with Zaïda and he went in search of her. He was carrying her shawl, which she had given him to hold.  <br><br>  ""W'at time it is?"" she asked him when he had found and secured her. They were under one of the kerosene lamps on the front gallery and he drew forth his silver watch. She seemed to be still laboring under some suppressed excitement that he had noticed before.  <br><br>  ""It's fo'teen minutes pas' twelve,"" he told her exactly.  <br><br>  ""I wish you'd fine out w'ere Jules is. Go look yonda in the card-room if he's there, an' come tell me."" Jules had danced with all the prettiest girls. She knew it was his custom after accomplishing this agreeable feat, to retire to the card-room.  <br><br>  ""You'll wait yere till I come back?"" he asked.  <br><br>  ""I'll wait yere; you go on."" She waited but drew back a little into the shadow. Telèsphore lost no time.  <br><br>  ""Yes, he's yonda playin' cards with Foché an' some others I don' know,"" he reported when he had discovered her in the shadow. There had been a spasm of alarm when he did not at once see her where he had left her under the lamp.  <br><br>  ""Does he look - look like he's fixed yonda fo' good?""  <br><br>  ""He's got his coat off. Looks like he's fixed pretty comf'table fo' the nex' hour or two.""  <br><br>  ""Gi' me my shawl.""  <br><br>  ""You cole?"" offering to put it around her.  <br><br>  ""No, I ain't cole."" She drew the shawl about her shoulders and turned as if to leave him. But a sudden generous impulse seemed to move her, and she added:  <br><br>  ""Come along yonda with me.""  <br><br>  They descended the few rickety steps that led down to the yard. He followed rather than accompanied her across the beaten and trampled sward. Those who saw them thought they had gone out to take the air. The beams of light that slanted out from the house were fitful and uncertain, deepening the shadows. The embers under the empty gumbo-pot glared red in the darkness. There was a sound of quiet voices coming from under the trees.  <br><br>  Zaïda, closely accompanied by Telèsphore, went out where the vehicles and horses were fastened to the fence. She stepped carefully and held up her skirts as if dreading the least speck of dew or of dust.  <br><br>  ""Unhitch Jules' ho'se an' buggy there an' turn 'em 'roun' this way, please."" He did as instructed, first backing the pony, then leading it out to where she stood in the half-made road.  <br><br>  ""You goin' home?"" he asked her, ""betta let me water the pony.""  <br><br>  ""Neva mine."" She mounted and seating herself grasped the reins. ""No, I aint goin' home,"" she added. He, too, was holding the reins gathered in one hand across the pony's back.  <br><br>  ""W'ere you goin'?"" he demanded.  <br><br>  ""Neva you mine w'ere I'm goin'.""  <br><br>  ""You ain't goin' anyw'ere this time o' night by yo'se'f?""  <br><br>  ""W'at you reckon I'm 'fraid of?"" she laughed. ""Turn loose that ho'se,"" at the same time urging the animal forward. The little brute started away with a bound and Telèsphore, also with a bound, sprang into the buckboard and seated himself beside Zaïda.  <br><br>  ""You ain't goin' anyw'ere this time o' night by yo'se'f."" It was not a question now, but an assertion, and there was no denying it. There was even no disputing it, and Zaïda recognizing the fact drove on in silence.  <br><br>  There is no animal that moves so swiftly across a 'Cadian prairie as the little Creole pony. This one did not run nor trot; he seemed to reach out in galloping bounds. The buckboard creaked, bounced, jolted and swayed. Zaïda clutched at her shawl while Telèsphore drew his straw hat further down over his right eye and offered to drive. But he did not know the road and she would not let him. They had soon reached the woods.  <br><br>  If there is any animal that can creep more slowly through a wooded road than the little Creole pony, that animal has not yet been discovered in Acadie. This particular animal seemed to be appalled by the darkness of the forest and filled with dejection. His head drooped and he lifted his feet as if each hoof were weighted with a thousand pounds of lead. Any one unacquainted with the peculiarities of the breed would sometimes have fancied that he was standing still. But Zaïda and Telèsphore knew better. Zaïda uttered a deep sigh as she slackened her hold on the reins and Telèsphore, lifting his hat, let it swing from the back of his head.  <br><br>  ""How you don' ask me w'ere I'm goin'?"" she said finally. These were the first words she had spoken since refusing his offer to drive.  <br><br>  ""Oh, it don' make any diff'ence w'ere you goin'.""  <br><br>  ""Then if it don' make any diff'ence w'ere I'm goin', I jus' as well tell you."" She hesitated, however. He seemed to have no curiosity and did not urge her.  <br><br>  ""I'm goin' to get married,"" she said.  <br><br>  He uttered some kind of an exclamation; it was nothing articulate - more like the tone of an animal that gets a sudden knife thrust. And now he felt how dark the forest was. An instant before it had seemed a sweet, black paradise; better than any heaven he had ever heard of.  <br><br>  ""W'y can't you get married at home?"" This was not the first thing that occurred to him to say, but this was the first thing he said.  <br><br>  ""Ah, b'en oui! with perfec' mules fo' a father an' mother! it's good enough to talk.""  <br><br>  ""W'y couldn' he come an' get you? W'at kine of a scound'el is that to let you go through the woods at night by yo'se'f?""  <br><br>  ""You betta wait till you know who you talkin' about. He didn' come an' get me because he knows I ain't 'fraid; an' because he's got too much pride to ride in Jules Trodon's buckboard afta he done been put out o' Jules Trodon's house.""  <br><br>  ""W'at's his name an' w'ere you goin' to fine 'im?""  <br><br>  ""Yonda on the other side the woods up at ole Wat Gibson's - a kine of justice the peace or something. Anyhow he's goin' to marry us. An' afta we done married those tetes-de-mulets yonda on bayou de Glaize can say w'at they want.""  <br><br>  ""W'at's his name?""  <br><br>  ""André Pascal.""  <br><br>  The name meant nothing to Telèsphore. For all he knew, André Pascal might be one of the shining lights of Avoyelles; but he doubted it.  <br><br>  ""You betta turn 'roun',"" he said. It was an unselfish impulse that prompted the suggestion. It was the thought of this girl married to a man whom even Jules Trodon would not suffer to enter his house.  <br><br>  ""I done give my word,"" she answered.  <br><br>  ""W'at's the matte with 'im? W'y don't yo' father and mother want you to marry 'im?""  <br><br>  ""W'y? Because it's always the same tune! W'en a man's down eve'ybody's got stones to throw at 'im. They say he's lazy. A man that will walk from St. Landry plumb to Rapides lookin' fo' work; an' they call that lazy! Then, somebody's been spreadin' yonda on the Bayou that he drinks. I don' b'lieve it. I neva saw 'im drinkin', me. Anyway, he won't drink afta he's married to me; he's too fon' of me fo' that. He say he'll blow out his brains if I don' marry 'im.""  <br><br>  ""I reckon you betta turn roun'.""  <br><br>  ""No, I done give my word."" And they went creeping on through the woods in silence.  <br><br>  ""W'at time is it?"" she asked after an interval. He lit a match and looked at his watch  <br><br>  ""It's quarta to one. W'at time did he say?""  <br><br>  ""I tole 'im I'd come about one o'clock. I knew that was a good time to get away f'om the ball.""  <br><br>  She would have hurried a little but the pony could not be induced to do so. He dragged himself, seemingly ready at any moment to give up the breath of life. But once out of the woods he made up for lost time. They were on the open prairie again, and he fairly ripped the air; some flying demon must have changed skins with him.  <br><br>  It was a few minutes of one o'clock when they drew up before Wat Gibson's house. It was not much more than a rude shelter, and in the dim starlight it seemed isolated, as if standing alone in the middle of the black, far- reaching prairie. As they halted at the gate a dog within set up a furious barking; and an old negro who had been smoking his pipe at that ghostly hour, advanced toward them from the shelter of the gallery. Telèsphore descended and helped his companion to alight.  <br><br>  ""We want to see Mr. Gibson,"" spoke up Zaïda. The old fellow had already opened the gate. There was no light in the house.  <br><br>  ""Marse Gibson, he yonda to ole Mr. Bodel's playin' kairds. But he neva' stay atter one o'clock. Come in, ma'am; come in, suh; walk right 'long in."" He had drawn his own conclusions to explain their appearance. They stood upon the narrow porch waiting while he went inside to light the lamp.  <br><br>  Although the house was small, as it comprised but one room, that room was comparatively a large one. It looked to Telèsphore and Zaïda very large and gloomy when they entered it. The lamp was on a table that stood against the wall, and that held further a rusty looking ink bottle, a pen and an old blank book. A narrow bed was off in the corner. The brick chimney extended into the room and formed a ledge that served as mantel shelf. From the big, low-hanging rafters swung an assortment of fishing tackle, a gun, some discarded articles of clothing and a string of red peppers. The boards of the floor were broad, rough and loosely joined together.  <br><br>  Telèsphore and Zaïda seated themselves on opposite sides of the table and the negro went out to the wood pile to gather chips and pieces of bois-gras with which to kindle a small fire.  <br><br>  It was a little chilly; he supposed the two would want coffee and he knew that Wat Gibson would ask for a cup the first thing on his arrival.  <br><br>  ""I wonder w'at's keepin' 'im,"" muttered Zaïda impatiently. Telèsphore looked at his watch. He had been looking at it at intervals of one minute straight along.  <br><br>  ""It's ten minutes pas' one,"" he said. He offered no further comment.  <br><br>  At twelve minutes past one Zaïda's restlessness again broke into speech.  <br><br>  ""I can't imagine, me, w'at's become of André! He said he'd be yere sho' at one."" The old negro was kneeling before the fire that he had kindled, contemplating the cheerful blaze. He rolled his eyes toward Zaïda.  <br><br>  ""You talkin' 'bout Mr. André Pascal? No need to look fo' him. Mr. André he b'en down to de P'int all day raisin' Cain.""  <br><br>  ""That's a lie,"" said Zaïda. Telèsphore said nothing.  <br><br>  ""Tain't no lie, ma'am; he b'en sho' raisin' de ole Nick."" She looked at him, too contemptuous to reply.  <br><br>  The negro told no lie so far as his bald statement was concerned. He was simply mistaken in his estimate of André Pascal's ability to ""raise Cain"" during an entire afternoon and evening and still keep a rendezvous with a lady at one o'clock in the morning. For André was even then at hand, as the loud and menacing howl of the dog testified. The negro hastened out to admit him.  <br><br>  André did not enter at once; he stayed a while outside abusing the dog and communicating to the negro his intention of coming out to shoot the animal after he had attended to more pressing business that was awaiting him within.  <br><br>  Zaïda arose, a little flurried and excited when he entered. Telèsphore remained seated.  <br><br>  Pascal was partially sober. There had evidently been an attempt at dressing for the occasion at some early part of the previous day, but such evidences had almost wholly vanished. His linen was soiled and his whole appearance was that of a man who, by an effort, had aroused himself from a debauch. He was a little taller than Telèsphore, and more loosely put together. Most women would have called him a handsomer man. It was easy to imagine that when sober, he might betray by some subtle grace of speech or manner, evidences of gentle blood.  <br><br>  ""W'y did you keep me waitin', André? w'en you knew - "" she got no further, but backed up against the table and stared at him with earnest, startled eyes.  <br><br>  ""Keep you waiting, Zaïda? my dear li'le Zaïdé, how can you say such a thing! I started up yere an hour ago an' that - w'ere's that damned ole Gibson?"" He had approached Zaïda with the evident intention of embracing her, but she seized his wrist and held him at arm's length away. In casting his eyes about for old Gibson his glance alighted upon Telèsphore.  <br><br>  The sight of the 'Cadian seemed to fill him with astonishment. He stood back and began to contemplate the young fellow and lose himself in speculation and conjecture before him, as if before some unlabeled wax figure. He turned for information to Zaïda.  <br><br>  ""Say, Zaïda, w'at you call this? W'at kine of damn fool you got sitting yere? Who let him in? W'at you reckon he's lookin' fo'? trouble?""  <br><br>  Telèsphore said nothing; he was awaiting his cue from Zaïda.  <br><br>  ""André Pascal,"" she said, ""you jus' as well take the do' an' go. You might stan' yere till the day o' judgment on yo' knees befo' me; an' blow out yo' brains if you a mine to. I ain't neva goin' to marry you.""  <br><br>  ""The hell you ain't!""  <br><br>  He had hardly more than uttered the words when he lay prone on his back. Telèsphore had knocked him down. The blow seemed to complete the process of sobering that had begun in him. He gathered himself together and rose to his feet; in doing so he reached back for his pistol. His hold was not yet steady, however, and the weapon slipped from his grasp and fell to the floor. Zaïda picked it up and laid it on the table behind her. She was going to see fair play.  <br><br>  The brute instinct that drives men at each other's throat was awake and stirring in these two. Each saw in the other a thing to be wiped out of his way - out of existence if need be. Passion and blind rage directed the blows which they dealt, and steeled the tension of muscles and clutch of fingers. They were not skillful blows, however.  <br><br>  The fire blazed cheerily; the kettle which the negro had placed upon the coals was steaming and singing. The man had gone in search of his master. Zaïda had placed the lamp out of harm's way on the high mantle ledge and she leaned back with her hands behind her upon the table.  <br><br>  She did not raise her voice or lift her finger to stay the combat that was acting before her. She was motionless, and white to the lips; only her eyes seemed to be alive and burning and blazing. At one moment she felt that André must have strangled Telèsphore; but she said nothing. The next instant she could hardly doubt that the blow from Telèsphore's doubled fist could be less than a killing one; but she did nothing.  <br><br>  How the loose boards swayed and creaked beneath the weight of the struggling men! the very old rafters seemed to groan; and she felt that the house shook.  <br><br>  The combat, if fierce, was short, and it ended out on the gallery whither they had staggered through the open door - or one had dragged the other - she could not tell. But she knew when it was over, for there was a long moment of utter stillness. Then she heard one of the men descend the steps and go away, for the gate slammed after him. The other went out to the cistern; the sound of the tin bucket splashing in the water reached her where she stood. He must have been endeavoring to remove traces of the encounter.  <br><br>  Presently Telèsphore entered the room. The elegance of his apparel had been somewhat marred; the men over at the 'Cadian ball would hardly have taken exception now to his appearance.  <br><br>  ""W'ere is André?"" the girl asked.  <br><br>  ""He's gone,"" said Telèsphore.  <br><br>  She had never changed her position and now when she drew herself up her wrist ached and she rubbed them a little. She was no longer pale; the blood had come back into her cheeks and lips, staining them crimson. She held out her hand to him. He took it gratefully enough, but he did not know what to do with it; that is, he did not know what he might dare to do with it, so he let it drop gently away and went to the fire.  <br><br>  ""I reckon we betta be goin', too,"" she said. He stooped and poured some of the bubbling water from the kettle upon the coffee which the negro had set upon the hearth.  <br><br>  ""I'll make a l'ile coffee firs',"" he proposed, ""an' anyhow we betta wait till ole man w'at's- his-name comes back. It wouldn't look well to leave his house that way without some kine of excuse or explanation.""  <br><br>  She made no reply, but seated herself submissively beside the table.  <br><br>  Her will, which had been overmastering and aggressive, seemed to have grown numb under the disturbing spell of the past few hours. And illusion had gone from her, and had carried her love with it. The absence of regret revealed this to her. She realized, but could not comprehend it, not knowing that the love had been part of the illusion. She was tired in body and spirit, and it was with a sense of restfulness that she sat all drooping and relaxed and watched Telèsphore make the coffee.  <br><br>  He made enough for them both and a cup for old Wat Gibson when he should come in, and also one for the negro. He supposed the cups, the sugar and spoons were in the safe over there in the corner, and that is where he found them.  <br><br>  When he finally said to Zaïda, ""Come, I'm going to take you home now,"" and drew her shawl around her, pinning it under the chin, she was like a little child and followed whither he led in all confidence.  <br><br>  It was Telèsphore who drove on the way back, and he let the pony cut no capers, but held him to a steady and tempered gait. The girl was still quiet and silent; she was thinking tenderly - a little tearfully of those two old tetes-de-mulets yonder on Bayou de Glaize.  <br><br>  How they crept through the woods! and how dark it was and how still!  <br><br>  ""W'at time it is?"" whispered Zaïda. Alas! he could not tell her; his watch was broken. But almost for the first time in his life, Telèsphore did not care what time it was.  <br><br>"
54,A Pair of Silk Stockings,"Little Mrs. Sommers one day found herself the unexpected possessor of fifteen dollars. It seemed to her a very large amount of money, and the way in which it stuffed and bulged her worn old porte-monnaie gave her a feeling of importance such as she had not enjoyed for years.<br><br>    The question of investment was one that occupied her greatly. For a day or two she walked about apparently in a dreamy state, but really absorbed in speculation and calculation. She did not wish to act hastily, to do anything she might afterward regret. But it was during the still hours of the night when she lay awake revolving plans in her mind that she seemed to see her way clearly toward a proper and judicious use of the money.<br><br>    A dollar or two should be added to the price usually paid for Janie's shoes, which would insure their lasting an appreciable time longer than they usually did. She would buy so and so many yards of percale for new shirt waists for the boys and Janie and Mag. She had intended to make the old ones do by skilful patching. Mag should have another gown. She had seen some beautiful patterns, veritable bargains in the shop windows. And still there would be left enough for new stockings--two pairs apiece--and what darning that would save for a while! She would get caps for the boys and sailor-hats for the girls. The vision of her little brood looking fresh and dainty and new for once in their lives excited her and made her restless and wakeful with anticipation.<br><br>    The neighbors sometimes talked of certain ""better days"" that little Mrs. Sommers had known before she had ever thought of being Mrs. Sommers. She herself indulged in no such morbid retrospection. She had no time--no second of time to devote to the past. The needs of the present absorbed her every faculty. A vision of the future like some dim, gaunt monster sometimes appalled her, but luckily tomorrow never comes.<br><br>    Mrs. Sommers was one who knew the value of bargains; who could stand for hours making her way inch by inch toward the desired object that was selling below cost. She could elbow her way if need be; she had learned to clutch a piece of goods and hold it and stick to it with persistence and determination till her turn came to be served, no matter when it came.<br><br>    But that day she was a little faint and tired. She had swallowed a light luncheon--no! when she came to think of it, between getting the children fed and the place righted, and preparing herself for the shopping bout, she had actually forgotten to eat any luncheon at all!<br><br>    She sat herself upon a revolving stool before a counter that was comparatively deserted, trying to gather strength and courage to charge through an eager multitude that was besieging breastworks of shirting and figured lawn. An all-gone limp feeling had come over her and she rested her hand aimlessly upon the counter. She wore no gloves. By degrees she grew aware that her hand had encountered something very soothing, very pleasant to touch. She looked down to see that her hand lay upon a pile of silk stockings. A placard nearby announced that they had been reduced in price from two dollars and fifty cents to one dollar and ninety-eight cents; and a young girl who stood behind the counter asked her if she wished to examine their line of silk hosiery. She smiled, just as if she had been asked to inspect a tiara of diamonds with the ultimate view of purchasing it. But she went on feeling the soft, sheeny luxurious things--with both hands now, holding them up to see them glisten, and to feel them glide serpent-like through her fingers.<br><br>    Two hectic blotches came suddenly into her pale cheeks. She looked up at the girl.<br><br>    ""Do you think there are any eights-and-a-half among these?""<br><br>    There were any number of eights-and-a-half. In fact, there were more of that size than any other. Here was a light-blue pair; there were some lavender, some all black and various shades of tan and gray. Mrs. Sommers selected a black pair and looked at them very long and closely. She pretended to be examining their texture, which the clerk assured her was excellent.<br><br>    ""A dollar and ninety-eight cents,"" she mused aloud. ""Well, I'll take this pair."" She handed the girl a five-dollar bill and waited for her change and for her parcel. What a very small parcel it was! It seemed lost in the depths of her shabby old shopping-bag.<br><br>    Mrs. Sommers after that did not move in the direction of the bargain counter. She took the elevator, which carried her to an upper floor into the region of the ladies' waiting-rooms. Here, in a retired corner, she exchanged her cotton stockings for the new silk ones which she had just bought. She was not going through any acute mental process or reasoning with herself, nor was she striving to explain to her satisfaction the motive of her action. She was not thinking at all. She seemed for the time to be taking a rest from that laborious and fatiguing function and to have abandoned herself to some mechanical impulse that directed her actions and freed her of responsibility.<br><br>    How good was the touch of the raw silk to her flesh! She felt like lying back in the cushioned chair and revelling for a while in the luxury of it. She did for a little while. Then she replaced her shoes, rolled the cotton stockings together and thrust them into her bag. After doing this she crossed straight over to the shoe department and took her seat to be fitted.<br><br>    She was fastidious. The clerk could not make her out; he could not reconcile her shoes with her stockings, and she was not too easily pleased. She held back her skirts and turned her feet one way and her head another way as she glanced down at the polished, pointed-tipped boots. Her foot and ankle looked very pretty. She could not realize that they belonged to her and were a part of herself. She wanted an excellent and stylish fit, she told the young fellow who served her, and she did not mind the difference of a dollar or two more in the price so long as she got what she desired.<br><br>    It was a long time since Mrs. Sommers had been fitted with gloves. On rare occasions when she had bought a pair they were always ""bargains,"" so cheap that it would have been preposterous and unreasonable to have expected them to be fitted to the hand.<br><br>    Now she rested her elbow on the cushion of the glove counter, and a pretty, pleasant young creature, delicate and deft of touch, drew a long-wristed ""kid"" over Mrs. Sommers's hand. She smoothed it down over the wrist and buttoned it neatly, and both lost themselves for a second or two in admiring contemplation of the little symmetrical gloved hand. But there were other places where money might be spent.<br><br>    There were books and magazines piled up in the window of a stall a few paces down the street. Mrs. Sommers bought two high-priced magazines such as she had been accustomed to read in the days when she had been accustomed to other pleasant things. She carried them without wrapping. As well as she could she lifted her skirts at the crossings. Her stockings and boots and well fitting gloves had worked marvels in her bearing--had given her a feeling of assurance, a sense of belonging to the well-dressed multitude.<br><br>    She was very hungry. Another time she would have stilled the cravings for food until reaching her own home, where she would have brewed herself a cup of tea and taken a snack of anything that was available. But the impulse that was guiding her would not suffer her to entertain any such thought.<br><br>    There was a restaurant at the corner. She had never entered its doors; from the outside she had sometimes caught glimpses of spotless damask and shining crystal, and soft-stepping waiters serving people of fashion.<br><br>    When she entered her appearance created no surprise, no consternation, as she had half feared it might. She seated herself at a small table alone, and an attentive waiter at once approached to take her order. She did not want a profusion; she craved a nice and tasty bite--a half dozen blue-points, a plump chop with cress, a something sweet--a creme-frappee, for instance; a glass of Rhine wine, and after all a small cup of black coffee.<br><br>    While waiting to be served she removed her gloves very leisurely and laid them beside her. Then she picked up a magazine and glanced through it, cutting the pages with a blunt edge of her knife. It was all very agreeable. The damask was even more spotless than it had seemed through the window, and the crystal more sparkling. There were quiet ladies and gentlemen, who did not notice her, lunching at the small tables like her own. A soft, pleasing strain of music could be heard, and a gentle breeze, was blowing through the window. She tasted a bite, and she read a word or two, and she sipped the amber wine and wiggled her toes in the silk stockings. The price of it made no difference. She counted the money out to the waiter and left an extra coin on his tray, whereupon he bowed before her as before a princess of royal blood.<br><br>    There was still money in her purse, and her next temptation presented itself in the shape of a matinee poster.<br><br>    It was a little later when she entered the theatre, the play had begun and the house seemed to her to be packed. But there were vacant seats here and there, and into one of them she was ushered, between brilliantly dressed women who had gone there to kill time and eat candy and display their gaudy attire. There were many others who were there solely for the play and acting. It is safe to say there was no one present who bore quite the attitude which Mrs. Sommers did to her surroundings. She gathered in the whole--stage and players and people in one wide impression, and absorbed it and enjoyed it. She laughed at the comedy and wept--she and the gaudy woman next to her wept over the tragedy. And they talked a little together over it. And the gaudy woman wiped her eyes and sniffled on a tiny square of filmy, perfumed lace and passed little Mrs. Sommers her box of candy.<br><br>    The play was over, the music ceased, the crowd filed out. It was like a dream ended. People scattered in all directions. Mrs. Sommers went to the corner and waited for the cable car.<br><br>    A man with keen eyes, who sat opposite to her, seemed to like the study of her small, pale face. It puzzled him to decipher what he saw there. In truth, he saw nothing-unless he were wizard enough to detect a poignant wish, a powerful longing that the cable car would never stop anywhere, but go on and on with her forever.   <br><br>"
55,A Reflection,"Some people are born with a vital and responsive energy. It not only enables them to keep abreast of the times; it qualifies them to furnish in their own personality a good bit of the motive power to the mad pace. They are fortunate beings. They do not need to apprehend the significance of things. They do not grow weary nor miss step, nor do they fall out of rank and sink by the wayside to be left contemplating the moving procession.<br><br>    Ah! that moving procession that has left me by the road-side! Its fantastic colors are more brilliant and beautiful than the sun on the undulating waters. What matter if souls and bodies are failing beneath the feet of the ever-pressing multitude! It moves with the majestic rhythm of the spheres. Its discordant clashes sweep upward in one harmonious tone that blends with the music of other worlds--to complete God's orchestra.<br><br>    It is greater than the stars--that moving procession of human energy; greater than the palpitating earth and the things growing thereon. Oh! I could weep at being left by the wayside; left with the grass and the clouds and a few dumb animals. True, I feel at home in the society of these symbols of life's immutability. In the procession I should feel the crushing feet, the clashing discords, the ruthless hands and stifling breath. I could not hear the rhythm of the march.<br><br>    Salve! ye dumb hearts. Let us be still and wait by the roadside.                                     <br><br>"
56,A Respectable Woman,"Mrs. Baroda was a little provoked to learn that her husband expected his friend, Gouvernail, up to spend a week or two on the plantation.<br><br>    They had entertained a good deal during the winter; much of the time had also been passed in New Orleans in various forms of mild dissipation. She was looking forward to a period of unbroken rest, now, and undisturbed tete-a-tete with her husband, when he informed her that Gouvernail was coming up to stay a week or two.<br><br>    This was a man she had heard much of but never seen. He had been her husband's college friend; was now a journalist, and in no sense a society man or ""a man about town,"" which were, perhaps, some of the reasons she had never met him. But she had unconsciously formed an image of him in her mind. She pictured him tall, slim, cynical; with eye-glasses, and his hands in his pockets; and she did not like him. Gouvernail was slim enough, but he wasn't very tall nor very cynical; neither did he wear eyeglasses nor carry his hands in his pockets. And she rather liked him when he first presented himself.<br><br>    But why she liked him she could not explain satisfactorily to herself when she partly attempted to do so. She could discover in him none of those brilliant and promising traits which Gaston, her husband, had often assured her that he possessed. On the contrary, he sat rather mute and receptive before her chatty eagerness to make him feel at home and in face of Gaston's frank and wordy hospitality. His manner was as courteous toward her as the most exacting woman could require; but he made no direct appeal to her approval or even esteem.<br><br>    Once settled at the plantation he seemed to like to sit upon the wide portico in the shade of one of the big Corinthian pillars, smoking his cigar lazily and listening attentively to Gaston's experience as a sugar planter.<br><br>    ""This is what I call living,"" he would utter with deep satisfaction, as the air that swept across the sugar field caressed him with its warm and scented velvety touch. It pleased him also to get on familiar terms with the big dogs that came about him, rubbing themselves sociably against his legs. He did not care to fish, and displayed no eagerness to go out and kill grosbecs when Gaston proposed doing so.<br><br>    Gouvernail's personality puzzled Mrs. Baroda, but she liked him. Indeed, he was a lovable, inoffensive fellow. After a few days, when she could understand him no better than at first, she gave over being puzzled and remained piqued. In this mood she left her husband and her guest, for the most part, alone together. Then finding that Gouvernail took no manner of exception to her action, she imposed her society upon him, accompanying him in his idle strolls to the mill and walks along the batture. She persistently sought to penetrate the reserve in which he had unconsciously enveloped himself.<br><br>    ""When is he going--your friend?"" she one day asked her husband. ""For my part, he tires me frightfully.""<br><br>    ""Not for a week yet, dear. I can't understand; he gives you no trouble.""<br><br>    ""No. I should like him better if he did; if he were more like others, and I had to plan somewhat for his comfort and enjoyment.""<br><br>    Gaston took his wife's pretty face between his hands and looked tenderly and laughingly into her troubled eyes.<br><br>    They were making a bit of toilet sociably together in Mrs. Baroda's dressing-room.<br><br>    ""You are full of surprises, ma belle,"" he said to her. ""Even I can never count upon how you are going to act under given conditions."" He kissed her and turned to fasten his cravat before the mirror.<br><br>    ""Here you are,"" he went on, ""taking poor Gouvernail seriously and making a commotion over him, the last thing he would desire or expect.""<br><br>    ""Commotion!"" she hotly resented. ""Nonsense! How can you say such a thing? Commotion, indeed! But, you know, you said he was clever.""<br><br>    ""So he is. But the poor fellow is run down by overwork now. That's why I asked him here to take a rest.""<br><br>    ""You used to say he was a man of ideas,"" she retorted, unconciliated. ""I expected him to be interesting, at least. I'm going to the city in the morning to have my spring gowns fitted. Let me know when Mr. Gouvernail is gone; I shall be at my Aunt Octavie's.""<br><br>    That night she went and sat alone upon a bench that stood beneath a live oak tree at the edge of the gravel walk.<br><br>    She had never known her thoughts or her intentions to be so confused. She could gather nothing from them but the feeling of a distinct necessity to quit her home in the morning.<br><br>    Mrs. Baroda heard footsteps crunching the gravel; but could discern in the darkness only the approaching red point of a lighted cigar. She knew it was Gouvernail, for her husband did not smoke. She hoped to remain unnoticed, but her white gown revealed her to him. He threw away his cigar and seated himself upon the bench beside her; without a suspicion that she might object to his presence.<br><br>    ""Your husband told me to bring this to you, Mrs. Baroda,"" he said, handing her a filmy, white scarf with which she sometimes enveloped her head and shoulders. She accepted the scarf from him with a murmur of thanks, and let it lie in her lap.<br><br>    He made some commonplace observation upon the baneful effect of the night air at the season. Then as his gaze reached out into the darkness, he murmured, half to himself:<br><br>    ""`Night of south winds--night of the large few stars!<br><br>    Still nodding night--'""<br><br>    She made no reply to this apostrophe to the night, which, indeed, was not addressed to her.<br><br>    Gouvernail was in no sense a diffident man, for he was not a self-conscious one. His periods of reserve were not constitutional, but the result of moods. Sitting there beside Mrs. Baroda, his silence melted for the time.<br><br>    He talked freely and intimately in a low, hesitating drawl that was not unpleasant to hear. He talked of the old college days when he and Gaston had been a good deal to each other; of the days of keen and blind ambitions and large intentions. Now there was left with him, at least, a philosophic acquiescence to the existing order--only a desire to be permitted to exist, with now and then a little whiff of genuine life, such as he was breathing now.<br><br>    Her mind only vaguely grasped what he was saying. Her physical being was for the moment predominant. She was not thinking of his words, only drinking in the tones of his voice. She wanted to reach out her hand in the darkness and touch him with the sensitive tips of her fingers upon the face or the lips. She wanted to draw close to him and whisper against his cheek--she did not care what--as she might have done if she had not been a respectable woman.<br><br>    The stronger the impulse grew to bring herself near him, the further, in fact, did she draw away from him. As soon as she could do so without an appearance of too great rudeness, she rose and left him there alone.<br><br>    Before she reached the house, Gouvernail had lighted a fresh cigar and ended his apostrophe to the night.<br><br>    Mrs. Baroda was greatly tempted that night to tell her husband--who was also her friend--of this folly that had seized her. But she did not yield to the temptation. Beside being a respectable woman she was a very sensible one; and she knew there are some battles in life which a human being must fight alone.<br><br>    When Gaston arose in the morning, his wife had already departed. She had taken an early morning train to the city. She did not return till Gouvernail was gone from under her roof.<br><br>    There was some talk of having him back during the summer that followed. That is, Gaston greatly desired it; but this desire yielded to his wife's strenuous opposition.<br><br>    However, before the year ended, she proposed, wholly from herself, to have Gouvernail visit them again. Her husband was surprised and delighted with the suggestion coming from her.<br><br>    ""I am glad, chere amie, to know that you have finally overcome your dislike for him; truly he did not deserve it.""<br><br>    ""Oh,"" she told him, laughingly, after pressing a long, tender kiss upon his lips, ""I have overcome everything! you will see. This time I shall be very nice to him.""                              <br><br>"
57,A Sentimental Soul,"<b>I</b><br><br>LACODIE stayed longer than was his custom in Mamzelle Fleurette's little store that evening. He had been tempted by the vapid utterances of a conservative bellhanger to loudly voice his radical opinions upon the rights and wrongs of humanity at large and his fellow-workingmen in particular. He was quite in a tremble when he finally laid his picayune down upon Mamzelle Fleurette's counter and helped himself to <i>l'Abeille</i> from the top of the diminished pile of newspapers which stood there.<br><br>He was small, frail and hollow-chested, but his head was magnificent with its generous adornment of waving black hair; its sunken eyes that glowed darkly and steadily and sometimes flamed, and its moustaches which were formidable.<br><br>""Eh bien, Mamzelle Fleurette, a demain, a demain!"" and he waved a nervous good-bye as he let himself quickly and noiselessly out.<br><br>However violent Lacodie might be in his manner toward conservatives, he was always gentle, courteous and low-voiced with Mamzelle Fleurette, who was much older than he, much taller; who held no opinions, and whom he pitied, and even in a manner revered. Mamzelle Fleurette at once dismissed the bellhanger, with whom, on general principles, she had no sympathy.<br><br>She wanted to close the store, for she was going over to the cathedral to confession. She stayed a moment in the doorway watching Lacodie walk down the opposite side of the street. His step was something between a spring and a jerk, which to her partial eyes seemed the perfection of motion. She watched him until he entered his own small low doorway, over which hung a huge wooden key painted red, the emblem of his trade.<br><br>For many months now, Lacodie had been coming daily to Mamzelle Fleurette's little notion store to buy the morning paper, which he only bought and read, however, in the afternoon. Once he had crossed over with his box of keys and tools to open a cupboard, which would unlock for no inducements of its owner. He would not suffer her to pay him for the few moments' work; it was nothing, he assured her; it was a pleasure; he would not dream of accepting payment for so trifling a service from a camarade and fellow- worker. But she need not fear that he would lose by it, he told her with a laugh; he would only charge an extra quarter to the rich lawyer around the corner, or to the top-lofty druggist down the street when these might happen to need his services, as they sometimes did. This was an alternative which seemed far from right and honest to Mamzelle Fleurette. But she held a vague understanding that men were wickeder in many ways than women; that ungodliness was constitutional with them, like their sex, and inseparable from it.<br><br>Having watched Lacodie until he disappeared within his shop, she retired to her room, back of the store, and began her preparations to go out. She brushed carefully the black alpaca skirt, which hung in long nun-like folds around her spare figure. She smoothed down the brown, ill-fitting basque, and readjusted the old-fashioned, rusty black lace collar which she always wore. Her sleek hair was painfully and suspiciously black. She powdered her face abundantly with poudre de riz before starting out, and pinned a dotted black lace veil over her straw bonnet. There was little force or character or anything in her withered face, except a pathetic desire and appeal to be permitted to exist.<br><br>Mamzelle Fleurette did not walk down Chartres street with her usual composed tread; she seemed preoccupied and agitated. When she passed the locksmith's shop over the way and heard his voice within, she grew tremulously self-conscious, fingering her veil, swishing the black alpaca and waving her prayer book about with meaningless intention.<br><br>Mamzelle Fleurette was in great trouble; trouble which was so bitter, so sweet, so bewildering, so terrifying! It had come so stealthily upon her she had never suspected what it might be. She thought the world was growing brighter and more beautiful; she thought the flowers had redoubled their sweetness and the birds their song, and that the voices of her fellow-creatures had grown kinder and their faces truer.<br><br>The day before Lacodie had not come to her for his paper. At six o'clock he was not there, at seven he was not there, nor at eight, and then she knew he would not come. At first, when it was only a little past the time of his coming, she had sat strangely disturbed and distressed in the rear of the store, with her back to the door. When the door opened she turned with fluttering expectancy. It was only an unhappy-looking child, who wanted to buy some foolscap, a pencil and an eraser. The next to come in was an old mulatresse, who was bringing her prayer beads for Mamzelle Fleurette to mend. The next was a gentleman, to buy the Courier des Etats Unis, and then a young girl, who wanted a holy picture for her favorite nun at the Ursulines; it was everybody but Lacodie.<br><br>A temptation assailed Mamzelle Fleurette, almost fierce in its intensity, to carry the paper over to his shop herself, when he was not there at seven. She conquered it from sheer moral inability to do anything so daring, so unprecedented. But to-day, when he had come back and had stayed so long discoursing with the bellhanger, a contentment, a rapture, had settled upon her being which she could no longer ignore or mistake. She loved Lacodie. That fact was plain to her now, as plain as the conviction that every reason existed why she should not love him. He was the husband of another woman. To love the husband of another woman was one of the deepest sins which Mamzelle Fleurette knew; murder was perhaps blacker, but she was not sure. She was going to confession now. She was going to tell her sin to Almighty God and Father Fochelle, and ask their forgiveness. She was going to pray and beg the saints and the Holy Virgin to remove the sweet and subtle poison from her soul. It was surely a poison, and a deadly one, which could make her feel that her youth had come back and taken her by the hand.<br><br><b>II</b><br><br>Mamzelle Fleurette had been confessing for many years to old Father Fochelle. In his secret heart he often thought it a waste of his time and her own that she should come with her little babblings, her little nothings to him, calling them sins. He felt that a wave of the hand might brush them away, and that it in a manner compromised the dignity of holy absolution to pronounce the act over so innocent a soul.<br><br>To-day she had whispered all her shortcomings into his ear through the grating of the confessional; he knew them so well! There were many other penitents waiting to be heard, and he was about to dismiss her with a hasty blessing when she arrested him, and in hesitating, faltering accents told him of her love for the locksmith, the husband of another woman. A slap in the face would not have startled Father Fochelle more forcibly or more painfully. What soul was there on earth, he wondered, so hedged about with innocence as to be secure from the machinations of Satan! Oh, the thunder of indignation that descended upon Mamzelle Fleurette's head! She bowed down, beaten to earth beneath it. Then came questions, one, two, three, in quick succession, that made Mamzelle Fleurette gasp and clutch blindly before her. Why was she not a shadow, a vapor, that she might dissolve from before those angry, penetrating eyes; or a small insect, to creep into some crevice and there hide herself forevermore?<br><br>""Oh, father! no, no, no!"" she faltered, ""he knows nothing, nothing. I would die a hundred deaths before he should know, before anyone should know, besides yourself and the good God of whom I implore pardon.""<br><br>Father Fochelle breathed more freely, and mopped his face with a flaming bandana, which he took from the ample pocket of his soutane. But he scolded Mamzelle Fleurette roundly, unpityingly; for being a fool, for being a sentimentalist. She had not committed mortal sin, but the occasion was ripe for it; and look to it she must that she keep Satan at bay with watchfulness and prayer. ""Go, my child, and sin no more.""<br><br>Mamzelle Fleurette made a detour in regaining her home by which she would not have to pass the locksmith's shop. She did not even look in that direction when she let herself in at the glass door of her store.<br><br>Some time before, when she was yet ignorant of the motive which prompted the act, she had cut from a newspaper a likeness of Lacodie, who had served as foreman of the jury during a prominent murder trial. The likeness happened to be good, and quite did justice to the locksmith's fine physiognomy with its leonine hirsute adornment. This picture Mamzelle Fleurette had kept hitherto between the pages of her prayer book. Here, twice a day, it looked out at her; as she turned the leaves of the holy mass in the morning, and when she read her evening devotions before her own little home altar, over which hung a crucifix and a picture of the Empress Eugénie.<br><br>Her first action upon entering her room, even before she unpinned the dotted veil, was to take Lacodie's picture from her prayer book and place it at random between the leaves of a ""Dictionnaire de la Langue Francaise,"" which was the undermost of a pile of old books that stood on the corner of the mantelpiece. Between night and morning, when she would approach the holy sacrament, Mamzelle Fleurette felt it to be her duty to thrust Lacodie from her thoughts by every means and device known to her.<br><br>The following day was Sunday, when there was no occasion or opportunity for her to see the locksmith. Moreover, after partaking of holy communion, Mamzelle Fleurette felt invigorated; she was conscious of a new, if fictitious, strength to combat Satan and his wiles.<br><br>On Monday, as the hour approached for Lacodie to appear, Mamzelle Fleurette became harassed by indecision. Should she call in the young girl, the neighbor who relieved her on occasion, and deliver the store into the girl's hands for an hour or so? This might be well enough for once in a while, but she could not conveniently resort to this subterfuge daily. After all, she had her living to make, which consideration was paramount. She finally decided that she would retire to her little back room and when she heard the store door open she would call out:<br><br>""Is it you, Monsieur Lacodie? I am very busy; please take your paper and leave your cinq sous on the counter."" If it happened not to be Lacodie she would come forward and serve the customer in person. She did not, of course, expect to carry out this performance each day; a fresh device would no doubt suggest itself for tomorrow. Mamzelle Fleurette proceeded to carry out her programme to the letter.<br><br>""Is it you, Monsieur Lacodie?"" she called out from the little back room, when the front door opened. ""I am very busy; please take your paper - ""<br><br>""Ce n'est pas Lacodie, Mamzelle Fleurette. C'est moi, Augustine.""<br><br>It was Lacodie's wife, a fat, comely young woman, wearing a blue veil thrown carelessly over her kinky black hair, and carrying some grocery parcels clasped close in her arms. Mamzelle Fleurette emerged from the back room, a prey to the most contradictory emotions; relief and disappointment struggling for the mastery with her.<br><br>""No Lacodie to-day, Mamzelle Fleurette,"" Augustine announced with a certain robust ill-humor; ""he is there at home shaking with a chill till the very window panes rattle. He had one last Friday"" (the day he had not come for his paper) ""and now another and a worse one to-day. God knows, if it keeps on - well, let me have the paper; he will want to read it to-night when his chill is past.""<br><br>Mamzelle Fleurette handed the paper to Augustine, feeling like an old woman in a dream handing a newspaper to a young woman in a dream. She had never thought of Lacodie having chills or being ill. It seemed very strange. And Augustine was no sooner gone than all the ague remedies she had ever heard of came crowding to Mamzelle Fleurette's mind; an egg in black coffee - or was it a lemon in black coffee? or an egg in vinegar? She rushed to the door to call Augustine back, but the young woman was already far down the street.<br><br><b>III</b><br><br>Augustine did not come the next day, nor the next, for the paper. The unhappy looking child who had returned for more foolscap, informed Mamzelle Fleurette that he had heard his mother say that Monsieur Lacodie was very sick, and the bellhanger had sat up all night with him. The following day Mamzelle Fleurette saw Choppin's coupe pass clattering over the cobblestones and stop before the locksmith's door. She knew that with her class it was only in a case of extremity that the famous and expensive physician was summoned. For the first time she thought of death. She prayed all day, silently, to herself, even while waiting upon customers.<br><br>In the evening she took an <i>Abeille</i> from the top of the pile on the counter, and throwing a light shawl over her head, started with the paper over to the locksmith's shop. She did not know if she were committing a sin in so doing. She would ask Father Fochelle on Saturday, when she went to confession. She did not think it could be a sin; she would have called long before on any other sick neighbor, and she intuitively felt that in this distinction might lie the possibility of sin.<br><br>The shop was deserted except for the presence of Lacodie's little boy of five, who sat upon the floor playing with the tools and contrivances which all his days he had coveted, and which all his days had been denied to him. Mamzelle Fleurette mounted the narrow stairway in the rear of the shop which led to an upper landing and then into the room of the married couple. She stood a while hesitating upon this landing before venturing to knock softly upon the partly open door through which she could hear their voices.<br><br>""I thought,"" she remarked apologetically to Augustine, ""that perhaps Monsieur Lacodie might like to look at the paper and you had no time to come for it, so I brought it myself.""<br><br>""Come in, come in, Mamzelle Fleurette. It's Mamzelle Fleurette who comes to inquire about you, Lacodie,"" Augustine called out loudly to her husband, whose half consciousness she somehow confounded with deafness.<br><br>Mamzelle Fleurette drew mincingly forward, clasping her thin hands together at the waist line, and she peeped timorously at Lacodie lying lost amid the bedclothes. His black mane was tossed wildly over the pillow and lent a fictitious pallor to the yellow waxiness of his drawn features. An approaching chill was sending incipient shudders through his frame, and making his teeth claque. But he still turned his head courteously in Mamzelle Fleurette's direction.<br><br>""Bien bon de votre part, Mamzelle Fleurette - mais c'est fini. J'suis flambé, flambé, flambé!""<br><br>Oh, the pain of it! to hear him in such extremity thanking her for her visit, assuring her in the same breath that all was over with him. She wondered how Augustine could hear it so composedly. She whisperingly inquired if a priest had been summoned.<br><br>""Inutile; il n'en veut pas,"" was Augustine's reply. So he would have no priest at his bedside, and here was a new weight of bitterness for Mamzelle Fleurette to carry all her days.<br><br>She flitted back to her store through the darkness, herself like a slim shadow. The November evening was chill and misty. A dull aureole shot out from the feeble gas jet at the corner, only faintly and for an instant illumining her figure as it glided rapidly and noiselessly along the banquette. Mamzelle Fleurette slept little and prayed much that night. Saturday morning Lacodie died. On Sunday he was buried and Mamzelle Fleurette did not go to the funeral, because Father Fochelle told her plainly she had no business there.<br><br>It seemed inexpressibly hard to Mamzelle Fleurette that she was not permitted to hold Lacodie in tender remembrance now that he was dead. But Father Fochelle, with his practical insight, made no compromise with sentimentality; and she did not question his authority, or his ability to master the subtleties of a situation utterly beyond reach of her own powers.<br><br>It was no longer a pleasure for Mamzelle Fleurette to go to confession as it had formerly been. Her heart went on loving Lacodie and her soul went on struggling; for she made this delicate and puzzling distinction between heart and soul, and pictured the two as set in a very death struggle against each other.<br><br>""I cannot help it, father. I try, but I cannot help it. To love him is like breathing; I do not know how to help it. I pray, and pray, and it does no good, for half of my prayers are for the repose of his soul. It surely cannot be a sin, to pray for the repose of his soul?""<br><br>Father Fochelle was heartily sick and tired of Mamzelle Fleurette and her stupidities. Oftentimes he was tempted to drive her from the confessional, and forbid her return until she should have regained a rational state of mind. But he could not withhold absolution from a penitent who, week after week, acknowledged her shortcoming and strove with all her faculties to overcome it and atone for it.<br><br><b>IV</b><br><br>Augustine had sold out the locksmith's shop and the business, and had removed further down the street over a bakery. Out of her window she had hung a sign, ""Blanchisseuse de Fin."" Often, in passing by, Mamzelle Fleurette would catch a glimpse of Augustine up at the window, plying the irons; her sleeves rolled to the elbows, baring her round, white arms, and the little black curls all moist and tangled about her face. It was early spring then, and there was a languor in the air; an odor of jasmine in every passing breeze; the sky was blue, unfathomable, and fleecy white; and people along the narrow street laughed, and sang, and called to one another from windows and doorways. Augustine had set a pot of rose-geranium on her window sill and hung out a bird cage.<br><br>Once, Mamzelle Fleurette in passing on her way to confession heard her singing roulades, vying with the bird in the cage. Another time she saw the young woman leaning with half her body from the window, exchanging pleasantries with the baker standing beneath on the banquette.<br><br>Still, a little later, Mamzelle Fleurette began to notice a handsome young fellow often passing the store. He was jaunty and debonnaire and wore a rich watchchain, and looked prosperous. She knew him quite well as a fine young Gascon, who kept a stall in the French Market, and from whom she had often bought charcuterie. The neighbors told her the young Gascon was paying his addresses to Mme. Lacodie. Mamzelle Fleurette shuddered. She wondered if Lacodie knew! The whole situation seemed suddenly to shift its base, causing Mamzelle Fleurette to stagger. What ground would her poor heart and soul have to do battle upon now?<br><br>She had not yet had time to adjust her conscience to the altered conditions when one Saturday afternoon, as she was about to start out to confession, she noticed an unusual movement down the street. The bellhanger, who happened to be presenting himself in the character of a customer, informed her that it was nothing more nor less than Mme. Lacodie returning from her wedding with the Gascon. He was black and bitter with indignation, and thought she might at least have waited for the year to be out. But the charivari was already on foot; and Mamzelle need not feel alarmed if, in the night, she heard sounds and clamor to rouse the dead as far away as Metairie ridge.<br><br>Mamzelle Fleurette sank down in a chair, trembling in all her members. She faintly begged the bell hanger to pour her a glass of water from the stone pitcher behind the counter. She fanned herself and loosened her bonnet strings. She sent the bell hanger away.<br><br>She nervously pulled off her rusty black kid gloves, and ten times more nervously drew them on again. To a little customer, who came in for chewing gum, she handed a paper of pins.<br><br>There was a great, a terrible upheaval taking place in Mamzelle Fleurette's soul. She was preparing for the first time in her life to take her conscience into her own keeping.<br><br>When she felt herself sufficiently composed to appear decently upon the street, she started out to confession. She did not go to Father Fochelle. She did not even go to the Cathedral; but to a church which was much farther away, and to reach which she had to spend a picayune for car fare.<br><br>Mamzelle Fleurette confessed herself to a priest who was utterly new and strange to her. She told him all her little venial sins, which she had much difficulty in bringing to a number of any dignity and importance whatever. Not once did she mention her love for Lacodie, the dead husband of another woman.<br><br>Mamzelle Fleurette did not ride back to her home; she walked. The sensation of walking on air was altogether delicious; she had never experienced it before. A long time she stood contemplative before a shop window in which were displayed wreaths, mottoes, emblems, designed for the embellishment of tombstones. What a sweet comfort it would be, she reflected, on the 1st of November to carry some such delicate offering to Lacodie's last resting place. Might not the sole care of his tomb devolve upon her, after all! The possibility thrilled her and moved her to the heart. What thought would the merry Augustine and her lover-husband have for the dead lying in cemeteries!<br><br>When Mamzelle Fleurette reached home she went through the store directly into her little back room. The first thing which she did, even before unpinning the dotted lace veil, was to take the ""Dictionnaire de La Langue Francaise"" from beneath the pile of old books on the mantelpiece. It was not easy to find Lacodie's picture hidden somewhere in its depths. But the search afforded her almost a sensuous pleasure; turning the leaves slowly back and forth.<br><br>When she had secured the likeness she went into the store and from her showcase selected a picture frame - the very handsomest there; one of those which sold for thirty-five cents.<br><br>Into the frame Mamzelle Fleurette neatly and deftly pasted Lacodie's picture. Then she re-entered her room and deliberately hung it upon the wall - between the crucifix and the portrait of Empress Eugènie - and she did not care if the Gascon's wife ever saw it or not.<br><br>"
58,A Shameful Affair,"Mildred Orme, seated in the snuggest corner of the big front porch  of the Kraummer farmhouse, was as content as a girl need hope to  be.<br><br>    This was no such farm as one reads about in humorous fiction.  Here were swelling acres where the undulating wheat gleamed in  the sun like a golden sea. For silver there was the Meramec or,  better, it was pure crystal, for here and there one might look clean  through it down to where the pebbles lay like green and yellow  gems. Along the river's edge trees were growing to the very water,  and in it, sweeping it when they were willows.<br><br>    The house itself was big and broad, as country houses should be.  The master was big and broad, too. The mistress was small and  thin, and it was always she who went out at noon to pull the great  clanging bell that called the farmhands in to dinner.<br><br>    From her agreeable corner where she lounged with her Browning  or her Ibsen, Mildred watched the woman do this every day. Yet  when the clumsy farmhands all came tramping up the steps and  crossed the porch in going to their meal that was served within,  she never looked at them. Why should she? Farmhands are not so  very nice to look at, and she was nothing of an anthropologist. But  once when the half dozen men came along, a paper which she had  laid carelessly upon the railing was blown across their path. One of  them picked it up, and when he had mounted the steps restored it  to her. He was young, and brown, of course, as the sun had made  him. He had nice blue eyes. His fair hair was dishevelled. His  shoulders were broad and square and his limbs strong and clean. A  not unpicturesque figure in the rough attire that bared his throat to  view and gave perfect freedom to his every motion.<br><br>    Mildred did not make these several observations in the half second  that she looked at him in courteous acknowledgment. It took her as  many days to note them all. For she signaled him out each time  that he passed her, meaning to give him a condescending little  smile, as she knew how. But he never looked at her. To be sure,  clever young women of twenty, who are handsome, besides, who  have refused their half dozen offers and are settling down to the  conviction that life is a tedious affair, are not going to care a straw  whether farmhands look at them or not. And Mildred did not care,  and the thing would not have occupied her a moment if Satan had  not intervened, in offering the employment which natural  conditions had failed to supply. It was summer time; she was idle;  she was piqued, and that was the beginning of the shameful affair.<br><br>    ""Who are these men, Mrs. Kraummer, that work for you? Where  do you pick them up?""<br><br>    ""Oh, ve picks 'em up everyvere. Some is neighbors, some is  tramps, and so.""<br><br>    ""And that broad-shouldered young fellow is he a neighbor? The  one who handed me my paper the other day you remember?""<br><br>    ""Gott, no! You might yust as well say he vas a tramp. Aber he  vorks like a steam ingine.""<br><br>    ""Well, he's an extremely disagreeable-looking man. I should think  you'd be afraid to have him about, not knowing him.""<br><br>    ""Vat you vant to be 'fraid for?"" laughed the little woman. ""He don't  talk no more un ven he vas deef und dumb. I didn't t'ought you vas  sooch a baby.""<br><br>    ""But, Mrs. Kraummer, I don't want you to think I'm a baby, as you  say  a coward, as you mean. Ask the man if he will drive me to  church tomorrow. You see, I'm not so very much afraid of him,""  she added with a smile.<br><br>    The answer which this unmannerly farmhand returned to Mildred's  request was simply a refusal. He could not drive her to church  because he was going fishing.<br><br>    ""Aber,"" offered good Mrs. Kraummer, ""Hans Platzfeldt will drive  you to church, oder verever you vants. He vas a goot boy vat you  can trust, dat Hans.""<br><br>    ""Oh, thank him very much. But I find I have so many letters to  write tomorrow, and it promises to be hot, too. I shan't care to go  to church after all.""<br><br>    She could have cried for vexation. Snubbed by a farmhand! a  tramp, perhaps. She, Mildred Orme, who ought really to have been  with the rest of the family at Narragansett who had come to seek in  this retired spot the repose that would enable her to follow exalted  lines of thought. She marveled at the problematic nature of  farmhands.<br><br>    After sending her the uncivil message already recorded, and as he  passed beneath the porch where she sat, he did look at her finally,  in a way to make her positively gasp at the sudden effrontery of the  man.<br><br>    But the inexplicable look stayed with her. She could not banish it.<br><br>    <b>II</b><br><br>    It was not so very hot after all, the next day, when Mildred walked  down the long narrow footpath that led through the bending wheat  to the river. High above her waist reached the yellow grain.  Mildred's brown eyes filled with a reflected golden light as they  caught the glint of it, as she heard the trill that it answered to the  gentle breeze. Anyone who has walked through the wheat in  midsummer-time knows that sound.<br><br>    In the woods it was sweet and solemn and cool. And there beside  the river was the wretch who had annoyed her, first, with his  indifference, then with the sudden boldness of his glance.<br><br>    ""Are you fishing?"" she asked politely and with kindly dignity,  which she supposed would define her position toward him. The  inquiry lacked not pertinence, seeing that he sat motionless, with a  pole in his hand and his eyes fixed on a cork that bobbed aimlessly  on the water.<br><br>    ""Yes, madam,"" was his brief reply.<br><br>    ""It won't disturb you if I stand here a moment, to see what success  you will have?""<br><br>    ""No, madam.""<br><br>    She stood very still, holding tight to the book she had brought with  her. Her straw hat had slipped disreputably to one side, over the  wavy bronzebrown bang that half covered her forehead. Her  cheeks were ripe with color that the sun had coaxed there; so were  her lips.<br><br>    All the other farmhands had gone forth in Sunday attire. Perhaps  this one had none better than these working clothes that he wore.  A feminine commiseration swept her at the thought. He spoke  never a word. She wondered how many hours he could sit there, so  patiently waiting for fish to come to his hook. For her part, the  situation began to pall, and she wanted to change it at last.<br><br>    ""Let me try a moment, please? I have an idea.""<br><br>    ""Yes, madam.""<br><br>    ""The man is surely an idiot, with his monosyllables,"" she  commented inwardly. But she remembered that monosyllables  belong to a boor's equipment.<br><br>    She laid her book carefully down and took the pole gingerly that  he came to place in her hands. Then it was his turn to stand back  and look respectfully and silently on at the absorbing performance.<br><br>    ""Oh!"" cried the girl, suddenly, seized with excitement upon seeing  the line dragged deep in the water.<br><br>    ""Wait, wait! Not yet.""<br><br>    He sprang to her side. With his eyes eagerly fastened on the tense  line, he grasped the pole to prevent her drawing it, as her intention  seemed to be. That is, he meant to grasp the pole, but instead, his  brown hand came down upon Mildred's white one.<br><br>    He started violently at finding himself so close to a bronze-brown  tangle that almost swept his chin to a hot cheek only a few inches  away from his shoulder, to a pair of young, dark eyes that gleamed  for an instant unconscious things into his own.<br><br>    Then, why ever it happened, or how ever it happened, his arms  were holding Mildred and he kissed her lips. She did not know if it  was ten times or only once.<br><br>    She looked around her face milk-white to see him disappear with  rapid strides through the path that had brought her there. Then she  was alone.<br><br>    Only the birds had seen, and she could count on their discretion.  She was not wildly indignant, as many would have been. Shame  stunned her. But through it she gropingly wondered if she should  tell the Kraummers that her chaste lips had been rifled of their  innocence. Publish her own confusion? No! Once in her room she  would give calm thought to the situation, and determine then how  to act. The secret must remain her own: a hateful burden to bear  alone until she could forget it.<br><br>    <b>III</b><br><br>    And because she feared not to forget it, Mildred wept that night.  All day long a hideous truth had been thrusting itself upon her that  made her ask herself if she could be mad. She feared it. Else why  was that kiss the most delicious thing she had known in her twenty  years of life? The sting of it had never left her lips since it was  pressed into them. The sweet trouble of it banished sleep from her  pillow.<br><br>    But Mildred would not bend the outward conditions of her life to  serve any shameful whim that chanced to visit her soul, like an  ugly dream. She would avoid nothing. She would go and come as  always.<br><br>    In the morning she found in her chair upon the porch the book she  had left by the river. A fresh indignity! But she came and went as  she intended to, and sat as usual upon the porch amid her familiar  surroundings. When the Offender passed her by she knew it,  though her eyes were never lifted. Are there only sight and sound  to tell such things? She discerned it by a wave that swept her with  confusion and she knew not what besides.<br><br>    She watched him furtively, one day, when he talked with Farmer  Kraummer out in the open. When he walked away she remained  like one who has drunk much wine. Then unhesitatingly she turned  and began her preparations to leave the Kraummer farmhouse.<br><br>    When the afternoon was far spent they brought letters to her. One  of them read like this:<br><br>    ""My Mildred, deary! I am only now at Narragansett, and so broke  up not to find you. So you are down at that Kraummer farm, on the  Iron Mountain. Well! What do you think of that delicious crank,  Fred Evelyn? For a man must be a crank who does such things.  Only fancy! Last year he chose to drive an engine back and forth  across the plains. This year he tills the soil with laborers. Next year  it will be something else as insane because he likes to live more  lives than one kind, and other Quixotic reasons. We are great  chums. He writes me he's grown as strong as an ox. But he hasn't  mentioned that you are there. I know you don't get on with him, for  he isn't a bit intellectual detests Ibsen and abuses Tolstoi. He  doesn't read 'in books' says they are spectacles for the shortsighted  to look at life through. Don't snub him, dear, or be too hard on  him; he has a heart of gold, if he is the first crank in America.""<br><br>    Mildred tried to think to feel that the intelligence which this letter  brought to her would take somewhat of the sting from the shame  that tortured her. But it did not. She knew that it could not.<br><br>    In the gathering twilight she walked again through the wheat that  was heavy and fragrant with dew. The path was very long and very  narrow. When she was midway she saw the Offender coming  toward her. What could she do? Turn and run, as a little child  might? Spring into the wheat, as some frightened four-footed  creature would? There was nothing but to pass him with the  dignity which the occasion clearly demanded.<br><br>    But he did not let her pass. He stood squarely in the pathway  before her, hat in hand, a perturbed look upon his face.<br><br>    ""Miss Orme,"" he said, ""I have wanted to say to you, every hour of  the past week, that I am the most consummate hound that walks  the earth.""<br><br>    She made no protest. Her whole bearing seemed to indicate that  her opinion coincided with his own.<br><br>    ""If you have a father, or brother, or any one, in short, to whom you  may say such things ""<br><br>    ""I think you aggravate the offense, sir, by speaking of it. I shall ask  you never to mention it again. I want to forget that it ever  happened. Will you kindly let me by.""<br><br>    ""Oh,"" he ventured eagerly, ""you want to forget it! Then, maybe,  since you are willing to forget, you will be generous enough to  forgive the offender some day?""<br><br>    ""Some day,"" she repeated, almost inaudibly, looking seemingly  through him, but not at him ""some day perhaps; when I shall have  forgiven myself.""<br><br>    He stood motionless, watching her slim, straight figure lessening  by degrees as she walked slowly away from him. He was  wondering what she meant. Then a sudden, quick wave came  beating into his brown throat and staining it crimson, when he  guessed what it might be.                                    <br><br>"
59,At the 'Cadian Ball,"Bobint, that big, brown, good-natured Bobint, had no intention of going to the ball, even though he knew Calixta would be there. For what came of those balls but heartache, and a sickening disinclination for work the whole week through, till Saturday night came again and his tortures began afresh? Why could he not love Ozina, who would marry him to-morrow; or Fronie, or any one of a dozen others, rather than that little Spanish vixen? Calixta's slender foot had never touched Cuban soil; but her mother's had, and the Spanish was in her blood all the same. For that reason the prairie people forgave her much that they would not have overlooked in their own daughters or sisters.<br><br>    Her eyes,  Bobint thought of her eyes, and weakened,  the bluest, the drowsiest, most tantalizing that ever looked into a man's, he thought of her flaxen hair that kinked worse than a mulatto's close to her head; that broad, smiling mouth and tip-tilted nose, that full figure; that voice like a rich contralto song, with cadences in it that must have been taught by Satan, for there was no one else to teach her tricks on that 'Cadian prairie. Bobint thought of them all as he plowed his rows of cane.<br><br>    There had even been a breath of scandal whispered about her a year ago, when she went to Assumption, but why talk of it? No one did now. ""C'est Espagnol, a,"" most of them said with lenient shoulder-shrugs. ""Bon chien tient de race,"" the old men mumbled over their pipes, stirred by recollections. Nothing was made of it, except that Fronie threw it up to Calixta when the two quarreled and fought on the church steps after mass one Sunday, about a lover. Calixta swore roundly in fine 'Cadian French and with true Spanish spirit, and slapped Fronie's face. Fronie had slapped her back; ""Tiens, bocotte, va!"" ""Espce de lionse; prends a, et a!"" till the cur himself was obliged to hasten and make peace between them. Bobint thought of it all, and would not go to the ball.<br><br>    But in the afternoon, over at Friedheimer's store, where he was buying a trace-chain, he heard some one say that Alce Laballire would be there. Then wild horses could not have kept him away. He knew how it would beor rather he did not know how it would beif the handsome young planter came over to the ball as he sometimes did. If Alce happened to be in a serious mood, he might only go to the card-room and play a round or two; or he might stand out on the galleries talking crops and politics with the old people. But there was no telling. A drink or two could put the devil in his head,that was what Bobint said to himself, as he wiped the sweat from his brow with his red bandanna; a gleam from Calixta's eyes, a flash of her ankle, a twirl of her skirts could do the same. Yes, Bobint would go to the ball.<br><br>    That was the year Alce Laballire put nine hundred acres in rice. It was putting a good deal of money into the ground, but the returns promised to be glorious. Old Madame Laballire, sailing about the spacious galleries in her white volante, figured it all out in her head. Clarisse, her goddaughter helped her a little, and together they built more air-castles than enough. Alce worked like a mule that time; and if he did not kill himself, it was because his constitution was an iron one. It was an every-day affair for him to come in from the field well-nigh exhausted, and wet to the waist. He did not mind if there were visitors; he left them to his mother and Clarisse. There were often guests: young men and women who came up from the city, which was but a few hours away, to visit his beautiful kinswoman. She was worth going a good deal farther than that to see. Dainty as a lily; hardy as a sunflower; slim, tall, graceful, like one of the reeds that grew in the marsh. Cold and kind and cruel by turn, and everything that was aggravating to Alce.<br><br>    He would have liked to sweep the place of those visitors, often. Of the men, above all, with their ways and their manners; their swaying of fans like women, and dandling about hammocks. He could have pitched them over the levee into the river, if it hadn't meant murder. That was Alce. But he must have been crazy the day he came in from the rice-field, and, toil-stained as he was, clasped Clarisse by the arms and panted a volley of hot, blistering love-words into her face. No man had ever spoken love to her like that.<br><br>    ""Monsieur!"" she exclaimed, looking him full in the eyes, without a quiver. Alce's hands dropped and his glance wavered before the chill of her calm, clear eyes.<br><br>    ""Par exemple!"" she muttered disdainfully, as she turned from him, deftly adjusting the careful toilet that he had so brutally disarranged.<br><br>    That happened a day or two before the cyclone came that cut into the rice like fine steel. It was an awful thing, coming so swiftly, without a moment's warning in which to light a holy candle or set a piece of blessed palm burning. Old madame wept openly and said her beads, just as her son Didier, the New Orleans one, would have done. If such a thing had happened to Alphonse, the Laballire planting cotton up in Natchitoches, he would have raved and stormed like a second cyclone, and made his surroundings unbearable for a day or two. But Alce took the misfortune differently. He looked ill and gray after it, and said nothing. His speechlessness was frightful. Clarisse's heart melted with tenderness; but when she offered her soft, purring words of condolence, he accepted them with mute indifference. Then she and her nnaine wept afresh in each other's arms.<br><br>    A night or two later, when Clarisse went to her window to kneel there in the moonlight and say her prayers before retiring, she saw that Bruce, Alce's negro servant, had led his master's saddle-horse noiselessly along the edge of the sward that bordered the gravel-path, and stood holding him near by. Presently, she heard Alce quit his room, which was beneath her own, and traverse the lower portico. As he emerged from the shadow and crossed the strip of moonlight, she perceived that he carried a pair of well-filled saddle-bags which he at once flung across the animal's back. He then lost no time in mounting, and after a brief exchange of words with Bruce, went cantering away, taking no precaution to avoid the noisy gravel as the negro had done.<br><br>    Clarisse had never suspected that it might be Alce's custom to sally forth from the plantation secretly, and at such an hour; for it was nearly midnight. And had it not been for the telltale saddle-bags, she would only have crept to bed, to wonder, to fret and dream unpleasant dreams. But her impatience and anxiety would not be held in check. Hastily unbolting the shutters of her door that opened upon the gallery, she stepped outside and called softly to the old negro.<br><br>    ""Gre't Peter! Miss Clarisse. I was n' sho it was a ghos' o' w'at, stan'in' up dah, plumb in de night, dataway.""<br><br>    He mounted halfway up the long, broad flight of stairs. She was standing at the top.<br><br>    ""Bruce, w'ere has Monsieur Alce gone?"" she asked.<br><br>    ""W'y, he gone 'bout he business, I reckin,"" replied Bruce, striving to be noncommittal at the outset.<br><br>    ""W'ere has Monsieur Alce gone?"" she reiterated, stamping her bare foot. ""I won't stan' any nonsense or any lies; mine, Bruce.""<br><br>    ""I don' ric'lic ez I eva tole you lie yit, Miss Clarisse. Mista Alce, he all broke up, sho.""<br><br>    ""W'ere - has - he gone? Ah, Sainte Vierge! faut de la patience! butor, va!""<br><br>    ""W'en I was in he room, a-breshin' off he clo'es to-day,"" the darkey began, settling himself against the stair-rail, ""he look dat speechless an' down, I say, 'You 'pear tu me like some pussun w'at gwine have a spell o' sickness, Mista Alce.' He say, 'You reckin?' 'I dat he git up, go look hisse'f stiddy in de glass. Den he go to de chimbly an' jerk up de quinine bottle an po' a gre't hoss-dose on to he han'. An' he swalla dat mess in a wink, an' wash hit down wid a big dram o' w'iskey w'at he keep in he room, aginst he come all soppin' wet outen de fiel'.<br><br>    ""He 'lows, 'No, I ain' gwine be sick, Bruce.' Den he square off. He say, 'I kin mak out to stan' up an' gi' an' take wid any man I knows, lessen hit 's John L. Sulvun. But w'en God A'mighty an' a 'omen jines fo'ces agin me, dat 's one too many fur me.' I tell 'im, 'Jis so,' while' I 'se makin' out to bresh a spot off w'at ain' dah, on he coat colla. I tell 'im, 'You wants li'le res', suh.' He say, 'No, I wants li'le fling; dat w'at I wants; an I gwine git it. Pitch me a fis'ful o' clo'es in dem 'ar saddle-bags.' Dat w'at he say. Don't you bodda, missy. He jis' gone a-caperin' yonda to de Cajun ball. Uh - uh - de skeeters is fair' a-swarmin' like bees roun' yo' foots!""<br><br>    The mosquitoes were indeed attacking Clarisse's white feet savagely. She had unconsciously been alternately rubbing one foot over the other during the darkey's recital.<br><br>    ""The 'Cadian ball,"" she repeated contemptously. ""Humph! Par exemple! Nice conduc' for a Laballire. An' he needs a saddle-bag, fill' with clothes, to go to the 'Cadian ball!""<br><br>    ""Oh, Miss Clarisse; you go on to bed, chile; git yo' soun' sleep. He 'low he come back in couple weeks o' so. I kiarn be repeatin' lot o' truck w'at young mans say, out heah face o' a young gal.""<br><br>    Clarisse said no more, but turned and abruptly reentered the house.<br><br>    ""You done talk too much wid yo' mouf already, you ole fool nigga, you,"" muttered Bruce to himself as he walked away.<br><br>    Alce reached the ball very late, of coursetoo late for the chicken gumbo which had been served at midnight.<br><br>    The big, low-ceiled roomthey called it a hallwas packed with men and women dancing to the music of three fiddles. There were broad galleries all around it. There was a room at one side where sober-faced men were playing cards. Another, in which babies were sleeping, was called le parc aux petits. Any one who is white may go to a 'Cadian ball, but he must pay for his lemonade, his coffee and chicken gumbo. And he must behave himself like a 'Cadian. Grosboeuf was giving this ball. He had been giving them since he was a young man, and he was a middle-aged one, now. In that time he could recall but one disturbance, and that was caused by American railroaders, who were not in touch with their surroundings and had no business there. ""Ces maudits gens du raiderode,"" Grosboeuf called them.<br><br>    Alce Laballire's presence at the ball caused a flutter even among the men, who could not but admire his ""nerve"" after such misfortune befalling him. To be sure, they knew the Laballires were richthat there were resources East, and more again in the city. But they felt it took a brave homme to stand a blow like that philosophically. One old gentleman, who was in the habit of reading a Paris newspaper and knew things, chuckled gleefully to everybody that Alce's conduct was altogether chic, mais chic. That he had more panache than Boulanger. Well, perhaps he had.<br><br>    But what he did not show outwardly was that he was in a mood for ugly things to-night. Poor Bobint alone felt it vaguely. He discerned a gleam of it in Alce's handsome eyes, as the young planter stood in the doorway, looking with rather feverish glance upon the assembly, while he laughed and talked with a 'Cadian farmer who was beside him.<br><br>    Bobint himself was dull-looking and clumsy. Most of the men were. But the young women were very beautiful. The eyes that glanced into Alce's as they passed him were big, dark, soft as those of the young heifers standing out in the cool prairie grass.<br><br>    But the belle was Calixta. Her white dress was not nearly so handsome or well made as Fronie's (she and Fronie had quite forgotten the battle on the church steps, and were friends again), nor were her slippers so stylish as those of Ozina; and she fanned herself with a handkerchief, since she had broken her red fan at the last ball, and her aunts and uncles were not willing to give her another. But all the men agreed she was at her best to-night. Such animation! and abandon! such flashes of wit!<br><br>    ""H, Bobint! Mais w'at's the matta? W'at you standin' plant l like ole Ma'ame Tina's cow in the bog, you?""<br><br>    That was good. That was an excellent thrust at Bobint, who had forgotten the figure of the dance with his mind bent on other things, and it started a clamor of laughter at his expense. He joined good-naturedly. It was better to receive even such notice as that from Calixta than none at all. But Madame Suzonne, sitting in a corner, whispered to her neighbor that if Ozina were to conduct herself in a like manner, she should immediately be taken out to the mule-cart and driven home. The women did not always approve of Calixta.<br><br>    Now and then were short lulls in the dance, when couples flocked out upon the galleries for a brief respite and fresh air. The moon had gone down pale in the west, and in the east was yet no promise of day. After such an interval, when the dancers again assembled to resume the interrupted quadrille, Calixta was not among them.<br><br>    She was sitting upon a bench out in the shadow, with Alce beside her. They were acting like fools. He had attempted to take a little gold ring from her finger; just for the fun of it, for there was nothing he could have done with the ring but replace it again. But she clinched her hand tight. He pretended that it was a very difficult matter to open it. Then he kept the hand in his. They seemed to forget about it. He played with her ear-ring, a thin crescent of gold hanging from her small brown ear. He caught a wisp of the kinky hair that had escaped its fastening, and rubbed the ends of it against his shaven cheek.<br><br>    ""You know, last year in Assumption, Calixta?"" They belonged to the younger generation, so preferred to speak English.<br><br>    ""Don't come say Assumption to me, M'sieur Alce. I done yeard Assumption till I 'm plumb sick.""<br><br>    ""Yes, I know. The idiots! Because you were in Assumption, and I happened to go to Assumption, they must have it that we went together. But it was nice hein, Calixta?in Assumption?""<br><br>    They saw Bobint emerge from the hall and stand a moment outside the lighted doorway, peering uneasily and searchingly into the darkness. He did not see them, and went slowly back.<br><br>    ""There is Bobint looking for you. You are going to set poor Bobint crazy. You 'll marry him some day; hein, Calixta?""<br><br>    ""I don't say no, me,"" she replied, striving to withdraw her hand, which he held more firmly for the attempt.<br><br>    ""But come, Calixta; you know you said you would go back to Assumption, just to spite them.""<br><br>    ""No, I neva said that, me. You mus' dreamt that.""<br><br>    ""Oh, I thought you did. You know I 'm going down to the city.""<br><br>    ""W'en?""<br><br>    ""To-night.""<br><br>    ""Betta make has'e, then; it 's mos' day.""<br><br>    ""Well, to-morrow 'll do.""<br><br>    ""W'at you goin' do, yonda?""<br><br>    ""I don't know. Drown myself in the lake, maybe; unless you go down there to visit your uncle.""<br><br>    Calixta's senses were reeling; and they well-nigh left her when she felt Alce's lips brush her ear like the touch of a rose.<br><br>    ""Mista Alce! Is dat Mista Alce?"" the thick voice of a negro was asking; he stood on the ground, holding to the banister-rails near which the couple sat.<br><br>    ""W'at do you want now?"" cried Alce impatiently. ""Can't I have a moment of peace?""<br><br>    ""I ben huntin' you high an' low, suh,"" answered the man. ""Dey - dey some one in de road, onda de mulbare-tree, want see you a minute.""<br><br>    ""I would n't go out to the road to see the Angel Gabriel. And if you come back here with any more talk, I 'll have to break your neck."" The negro turned mumbling away.<br><br>    Alce and Calixta laughed softly about it. Her boisterousness was all gone. They talked low, and laughed softly, as lovers do.<br><br>    ""Alce! Alce Laballire!""<br><br>    It was not the negro's voice this time; but one that went through Alce's body like an electric shock, bringing him to his feet.<br><br>    Clarisse was standing there in her riding-habit, where the negro had stood. For an instant confusion reigned in Alce's thoughts, as with one who awakes suddenly from a dream. But he felt that something of serious import had brought his cousin to the ball in the dead of night.<br><br>    ""W'at does this mean, Clarisse?"" he asked.<br><br>    ""It means something has happen' at home. You mus' come.""<br><br>    ""Happened to maman?"" he questioned, in alarm.<br><br>    ""No; nnaine is well, and asleep. It is something else. Not to frighten you. But you mus' come. Come with me, Alce.""<br><br>    There was no need for the imploring note. He would have followed the voice anywhere.<br><br>    She had now recognized the girl sitting back on the bench.<br><br>    ""Ah, c'est vous, Calixta? Comment a va, mon enfant?""<br><br>    ""Tcha va b'en; et vous, mam'zlle?""<br><br>    Alce swung himself over the low rail and started to follow Clarisse, without a word, without a glance back at the girl. He had forgotten he was leaving her there. But Clarisse whispered something to him, and he turned back to say ""Good-night, Calixta,"" and offer his hand to press through the railing. She pretended not to see it.<br><br>    .... .... .... .... . . .<br><br>    ""How come that? You settin' yere by yo'se'f, Calixta?"" It was Bobint who had found her there alone. The dancers had not yet come out. She looked ghastly in the faint, gray light struggling out of the east.<br><br>    ""Yes, that 's me. Go yonda in the parc aux petits an' ask Aunt Olisse fu' my hat. She knows w'ere 't is. I want to go home, me.""<br><br>    ""How you came?""<br><br>    ""I come afoot, with the Cateaus. But I 'm goin' now. I ent goin' wait fu' 'em. I 'm plumb wo' out, me.""<br><br>    ""Kin I go with you, Calixta?""<br><br>    ""I don' care.""<br><br>    They went together across the open prairie and along the edge of the fields, stumbling in the uncertain light. He told her to lift her dress that was getting wet and bedraggled; for she was pulling at the weeds and grasses with her hands.<br><br>    ""I don' care; it 's got to go in the tub, anyway. You been sayin' all along you want to marry me, Bobint. Well, if you want, yet, I don' care, me.""<br><br>    The glow of a sudden and overwhelming happiness shone out in the brown, rugged face of the young Acadian. He could not speak, for very joy. It choked him.<br><br>    ""Oh well, if you don' want,"" snapped Calixta, flippantly, pretending to be piqued at his silence.<br><br>    ""Bon Dieu! You know that makes me crazy, w'at you sayin'. You mean that, Calixta? You ent goin' turn roun' agin?""<br><br>    ""I neva tole you that much yet, Bobint. I mean that. Tiens,"" and she held out her hand in the business-like manner of a man who clinches a bargain with a hand-clasp. Bobint grew bold with happiness and asked Calixta to kiss him. She turned her face, that was almost ugly after the night's dissipation, and looked steadily into his.<br><br>    ""I don' want to kiss you, Bobint,"" she said, turning away again, ""not to-day. Some other time. Bont divine! ent you satisfy, yet!""<br><br>    ""Oh, I 'm satisfy, Calixta,"" he said.<br><br>    .... .... .... .... .... . .<br><br>    Riding through a patch of wood, Clarisse's saddle became ungirted, and she and Alce dismounted to readjust it.<br><br>    For the twentieth time he asked her what had happened at home.<br><br>    ""But, Clarisse, w'at is it? Is it a misfortune?""<br><br>    ""Ah Dieu sait!"" It 's only something that happen' to me.""<br><br>    ""To you!""<br><br>    ""I saw you go away las night, Alce, with those saddle-bags,"" she said, haltingly, striving to arrange something about the saddle, ""an' I made Bruce tell me. He said you had gone to the ball, an' wouldn' be home for weeks an' weeks. I thought, Alcemaybe you were going toto Assumption. I got wild. An' then I knew if you didn't come back, now, to-night, I could n't stan' it,again.""<br><br>    She had her face hidden in her arm that she was resting against the saddle when she said that.<br><br>    He began to wonder if this meant love. But she had to tell him so, before he believed it. And when she told him, he thought the face of the Universe was changedjust like Bobint. Was it last week the cyclone had well-nigh ruined him? The cyclone seemed a huge joke, now. It was he, then, who, an hour ago was kissing little Calixta's ear and whispering nonsense into it. Calixta was like a myth, now. The one, only, great reality in the world was Clarisse standing before him, telling him that she loved him.<br><br>    In the distance they heard the rapid discharge of pistol-shots; but it did not disturb them. They knew it was only the negro musicians who had gone into the yard to fire their pistols into the air, as the custom is, and to announce ""le bal est fini.""                                     <br><br>"
60,Beyond the Bayou,"The bayou curved like a crescent around the point of land on which La Folle's cabin stood. Between the stream and the hut lay a big abandoned field, where cattle were pastured when the bayou supplied them with water enough. Through the woods that spread back into unknown regions the woman had drawn an imaginary line, and past this circle she never stepped. This was the form of her only mania.<br><br>    She was now a large, gaunt black woman, past thirty-five. Her real name was Jacqueline, but every one on the plantation called her La Folle, because in childhood she had been frightened literally ""out of her senses,"" and had never wholly regained them.<br><br>    It was when there had been skirmishing and sharpshooting all day in the woods. Evening was near when P'tit Maitre, black with powder and crimson with blood, had staggered into the cabin of Jacqueline's mother, his pursuers close at his heels. The sight had stunned her childish reason.<br><br>    She dwelt alone in her solitary cabin, for the rest of the quarters had long since been removed beyond her sight and knowledge. She had more physical strength than most men, and made her patch of cotton and corn and tobacco like the best of them. But of the world beyond the bayou she had long known nothing, save what her morbid fancy conceived.<br><br>    People at Bellissime had grown used to her and her way, and they thought nothing of it. Even when ""Old Mis'"" died, they did not wonder that La Folle had not crossed the bayou, but had stood upon her side of it, wailing and lamenting.<br><br>    P'tit Maitre was now the owner of Bellissime. He was a middle-aged man, with a family of beautiful daughters about him, and a little son whom La Folle loved as if he had been her own. She called him Cheri, and so did every one else because she did.<br><br>    None of the girls had ever been to her what Cheri was. They had each and all loved to be with her, and to listen to her wondrous stories of things that always happened ""yonda, beyon' de bayou.""<br><br>    But none of them had stroked her black hand quite as Cheri did, nor rested their heads against her knee so confidingly, nor fallen asleep in her arms as he used to do. For Cheri hardly did such things now, since he had become the proud possessor of a gun, and had had his black curls cut off.<br><br>    That summer--the summer Cheri gave La Folle two black curls tied with a knot of red ribbon--the water ran so low in the bayou that even the little children at Bellissime were able to cross it on foot, and the cattle were sent to pasture down by the river. La Folle was sorry when they were gone, for she loved these dumb companions well, and liked to feel that they were there, and to hear them browsing by night up to her own enclosure.<br><br>    It was Saturday afternoon, when the fields were deserted. The men had flocked to a neighboring village to do their week's trading, and the women were occupied with household affairs,--La Folle as well as the others. It was then she mended and washed her handful of clothes, scoured her house, and did her baking.<br><br>    In this last employment she never forgot Cheri. To-day she had fashioned croquignoles of the most fantastic and alluring shapes for him. So when she saw the boy come trudging across the old field with his gleaming little new rifle on his shoulder, she called out gayly to him, ""Cheri! Cheri!""<br><br>    But Cheri did not need the summons, for he was coming straight to her. His pockets all bulged out with almonds and raisins and an orange that he had secured for her from the very fine dinner which had been given that day up at his father's house.<br><br>    He was a sunny-faced youngster of ten. When he had emptied his pockets, La Folle patted his round red cheek, wiped his soiled hands on her apron, and smoothed his hair. Then she watched him as, with his cakes in his hand, he crossed her strip of cotton back of the cabin, and disappeared into the wood.<br><br>    He had boasted of the things he was going to do with his gun out there.<br><br>    ""You think they got plenty deer in the wood, La Folle?"" he had inquired, with the calculating air of an experienced hunter.<br><br>    ""Non, non!"" the woman laughed. ""Don't you look fo' no deer, Cheri. Dat's too big. But you bring La Folle one good fat squirrel fo' her dinner to-morrow, an' she goin' be satisfi'.""<br><br>    ""One squirrel ain't a bite. I'll bring you mo' 'an one, La Folle,"" he had boasted pompously as he went away.<br><br>    When the woman, an hour later, heard the report of the boy's rifle close to the wood's edge, she would have thought nothing of it if a sharp cry of distress had not followed the sound.<br><br>    She withdrew her arms from the tub of suds in which they had been plunged, dried them upon her apron, and as quickly as her trembling limbs would bear her, hurried to the spot whence the ominous report had come.<br><br>    It was as she feared. There she found Cheri stretched upon the ground, with his rifle beside him. He moaned piteously:--<br><br>    ""I'm dead, La Folle! I'm dead! I'm gone!""<br><br>    ""Non, non!"" she exclaimed resolutely, as she knelt beside him. ""Put you' arm 'roun' La Folle's nake, Cheri. Dat's nuttin'; dat goin' be nuttin'."" She lifted him in her powerful arms.<br><br>    Cheri had carried his gun muzzle-downward. He had stumbled,--he did not know how. He only knew that he had a ball lodged somewhere in his leg, and he thought that his end was at hand. Now, with his head upon the woman's shoulder, he moaned and wept with pain and fright.<br><br>    ""Oh, La Folle! La Folle! it hurt so bad! I can' stan' it, La Folle!""<br><br>    ""Don't cry, mon bebe, mon bebe, mon Cheri!"" the woman spoke soothingly as she covered the ground with long strides. ""La Folle goin' mine you; Doctor Bonfils goin' come make mon Cheri well agin.""<br><br>    She had reached the abandoned field. As she crossed it with her precious burden, she looked constantly and restlessly from side to side. A terrible fear was upon her, --the fear of the world beyond the bayou, the morbid and insane dread she had been under since childhood.<br><br>    When she was at the bayou's edge she stood there, and shouted for help as if a life depended upon it:--<br><br>    ""Oh, P'tit Maitre! P'tit Maitre! Venez donc! Au secours! Au secours!""<br><br>    No voice responded. Cheri's hot tears were scalding her neck. She called for each and every one upon the place, and still no answer came.<br><br>    She shouted, she wailed; but whether her voice remained unheard or unheeded, no reply came to her frenzied cries. And all the while Cheri moaned and wept and entreated to be taken home to his mother.<br><br>    La Folle gave a last despairing look around her. Extreme terror was upon her. She clasped the child close against her breast, where he could feel her heart beat like a muffled hammer. Then shutting her eyes, she ran suddenly down the shallow bank of the bayou, and never stopped till she had climbed the opposite shore.<br><br>    She stood there quivering an instant as she opened her eyes. Then she plunged into the footpath through the trees.<br><br>    She spoke no more to Cheri, but muttered constantly, ""Bon Dieu, ayez pitie La Folle! Bon Dieu, ayez pitie moi!""<br><br>    Instinct seemed to guide her. When the pathway spread clear and smooth enough before her, she again closed her eyes tightly against the sight of that unknown and terrifying world.<br><br>    A child, playing in some weeds, caught sight of her as she neared the quarters. The little one uttered a cry of dismay.<br><br>    ""La Folle!"" she screamed, in her piercing treble. ""La Folle done cross de bayer!""<br><br>    Quickly the cry passed down the line of cabins.<br><br>    ""Yonda, La Folle done cross de bayou!""<br><br>    Children, old men, old women, young ones with infants in their arms, flocked to doors and windows to see this awe-inspiring spectacle. Most of them shuddered with superstitious dread of what it might portend. ""She totin' Cheri!"" some of them shouted.<br><br>    Some of the more daring gathered about her, and followed at her heels, only to fall back with new terror when she turned her distorted face upon them. Her eyes were bloodshot and the saliva had gathered in a white foam on her black lips.<br><br>    Some one had run ahead of her to where P'tit Maitre sat with his family and guests upon the gallery.<br><br>    ""P'tit Maitre! La Folle done cross de bayou! Look her! Look her yonda totin' Cheri!"" This startling intimation was the first which they had of the woman's approach.<br><br>    She was now near at hand. She walked with long strides. Her eyes were fixed desperately before her, and she breathed heavily, as a tired ox.<br><br>    At the foot of the stairway, which she could not have mounted, she laid the boy in his father's arms. Then the world that had looked red to La Folle suddenly turned black,--like that day she had seen powder and blood.<br><br>    She reeled for an instant. Before a sustaining arm could reach her, she fell heavily to the ground.<br><br>    When La Folle regained consciousness, she was at home again, in her own cabin and upon her own bed. The moon rays, streaming in through the open door and windows, gave what light was needed to the old black mammy who stood at the table concocting a tisane of fragrant herbs. It was very late.<br><br>    Others who had come, and found that the stupor clung to her, had gone again. P'tit Maitre had been there, and with him Doctor Bonfils, who said that La Folle might die.<br><br>    But death had passed her by. The voice was very clear and steady with which she spoke to Tante Lizette, brewing her tisane there in a corner.<br><br>    ""Ef you will give me one good drink tisane, Tante Lizette, I b'lieve I'm goin' sleep, me.""<br><br>    And she did sleep; so soundly, so healthfully, that old Lizette without compunction stole softly away, to creep back through the moonlit fields to her own cabin in the new quarters.<br><br>    The first touch of the cool gray morning awoke La Folle. She arose, calmly, as if no tempest had shaken and threatened her existence but yesterday.<br><br>    She donned her new blue cottonade and white apron, for she remembered that this was Sunday. When she had made for herself a cup of strong black coffee, and drunk it with relish, she quitted the cabin and walked across the old familiar field to the bayou's edge again.<br><br>    She did not stop there as she had always done before, but crossed with a long, steady stride as if she had done this all her life.<br><br>    When she had made her way through the brush and scrub cottonwood-trees that lined the opposite bank, she found herself upon the border of a field where the white, bursting cotton, with the dew upon it, gleamed for acres and acres like frosted silver in the early dawn.<br><br>    La Folle drew a long, deep breath as she gazed across the country. She walked slowly and uncertainly, like one who hardly knows how, looking about her as she went.<br><br>    The cabins, that yesterday had sent a clamor of voices to pursue her, were quiet now. No one was yet astir at Bellissime. Only the birds that darted here and there from hedges were awake, and singing their matins.<br><br>    When La Folle came to the broad stretch of velvety lawn that surrounded the house, she moved slowly and with delight over the springy turf, that was delicious beneath her tread.<br><br>    She stopped to find whence came those perfumes that were assailing her senses with memories from a time far gone.<br><br>    There they were, stealing up to her from the thousand blue violets that peeped out from green, luxuriant beds. There they were, showering down from the big waxen bells of the magnolias far above her head, and from the jessamine clumps around her.<br><br>    There were roses, too, without number. To right and left palms spread in broad and graceful curves. It all looked like enchantment beneath the sparkling sheen of dew.<br><br>    When La Folle had slowly and cautiously mounted the many steps that led up to the veranda, she turned to look back at the perilous ascent she had made. Then she caught sight of the river, bending like a silver bow at the foot of Bellissime. Exultation possessed her soul.<br><br>    La Folle rapped softly upon a door near at hand. Cheri's mother soon cautiously opened it. Quickly and cleverly she dissembled the astonishment she felt at seeing La Folle.<br><br>    ""Ah, La Folle! Is it you, so early?""<br><br>    ""Oui, madame. I come ax how my po' li'le Cheri do, 's mo'nin'.""<br><br>    ""He is feeling easier, thank you, La Folle. Dr. Bonfils says it will be nothing serious. He's sleeping now. Will you come back when he awakes?""<br><br>    ""Non, madame. I'm goin' wait yair tell Cheri wake up."" La Folle seated herself upon the topmost step of the veranda.<br><br>    A look of wonder and deep content crept into her face as she watched for the first time the sun rise upon the new, the beautiful world beyond the bayou.                              <br><br>"
61,Dead Men's Shoes,"    It never occurred to any person to wonder what would befall Gilma now that ""le vieux Gamiche"" was dead. After the burial people went their several ways, some to talk over the old man and his eccentricities, others to forget him before nightfall, and others to wonder what would become of his very nice property, the hundred-acre farm on which he had lived for thirty years, and on which he had just died at the age of seventy.   <br><br>  If Gilma had been a child, more than one motherly heart would have gone out to him. This one and that one would have bethought them of carrying him home with them; to concern themselves with his present comfort, if not his future welfare. But Gilma was not a child. He was a strapping fellow of nineteen, measuring six feet in his stockings, and as strong as any healthy youth need be. For ten years he had lived there on the plantation with Monsieur Gamiche; and he seemed now to have been the only one with tears to shed at the old man's funeral.    <br><br>  Gamiche's relatives had come down from Caddo in a wagon the day after his death, and had settled themselves in his house. There was Septime, his nephew, a cripple, so horribly afflicted that it was distressing to look at him. And there was Septime's widowed sister, Ma'me Broz&eacute;, with her two little girls. They had remained at the house during the burial, and Gilma found them still there upon his return.   <br><br>  The young man went at once to his room to seek a moment's repose. He had lost much sleep during Monsieur Gamiche's illness; yet, he was in fact more worn by the mental than the bodily strain of the past week.   <br><br>  But when he entered his room, there was something so changed in its aspect that it seemed no longer to belong to him. In place of his own apparel which he had left hanging on the row of pegs, there were a few shabby little garments and two battered straw hats, the property of the Broz&eacute; children. The bureau drawers were empty, there was not a vestige of anything belonging to him remaining in the room. His first impression was that Ma'me Broz&eacute; had been changing things around and had assigned him to some other room.     <br><br>  But Gilma understood the situation better when he discovered every scrap of his personal effects piled up on a bench outside the door, on the back or ""false"" gallery. His boots and shoes were under the bench, while coats, trousers and underwear were heaped in an indiscriminate mass together.   <br><br>  The blood mounted to his swarthy face and made him look for the moment like an Indian. He had never thought of this. He did not know what he had been thinking of; but he felt that he ought to have been prepared for anything; and it was his own fault if he was not. But it hurt. This spot was ""home"" to him against the rest of the world. Every tree, every shrub was a friend; he knew every patch in the fences; and the little old house, gray and weather-beaten, that had been the shelter of his youth, he loved as only few can love inanimate things. A great enmity arose in him against Ma'me Broz&eacute;. She was walking about the yard, with her nose in the air, and a shabby black dress trailing behind her. She held the little girls by the hand.   <br><br>  Gilma could think of nothing better to do than to mount his horse and ride away - anywhere. The horse was a spirited animal of great value. Monsieur Gamiche had named him ""Jupiter"" on account of his proud bearing, and Gilma had nicknamed him ""Jupe,"" which seemed to him more endearing and expressive of his great attachment to the fine creature. With the bitter resentment of youth, he felt that ""Jupe"" was the only friend remaining to him on earth.   <br><br>  He had thrust a few pieces of clothing in his saddlebags and had requested Ma'me Broz&eacute;, with assumed indifference, to put his remaining effects in a place of safety until he should be able to send for them.   <br><br>  As he rode around by the front of the house, Septime, who sat on the gallery all doubled up in his uncle Gamiche's big chair, called out:   <br><br>  ""He, Gilma! w'ere you boun' fo'?""    <br><br>  ""I'm goin' away,"" replied Gilma, curtly, reining his horse.   <br><br>  ""That's all right; but I reckon you might jus' as well leave that hoss behine you.""    <br><br>  ""The hoss is mine,"" returned Gilma, as quickly as he would have returned a blow.   <br><br>  ""We'll see 'bout that li'le later, my frien'. I reckon you jus' well turn 'im loose.""    <br><br>  Gilma had no more intention of giving up his horse than he had of parting with his own right hand. But Monsieur Gamiche had taught him prudence and respect for the law. He did not wish to invite disagreeable complications. So, controlling his temper by a supreme effort, Gilma dismounted, unsaddled the horse then and there, and led it back to the stable. But as he started to leave the place on foot, he stopped to say to Septime:   <br><br>  ""You know, Mr. Septime, that hoss is mine; I can collec' a hundred aff'davits to prove it. I'll bring them yere in a few days with a statement f'om a lawyer; an' I'll expec' the hoss an' saddle to be turned over to me in good condition.""    <br><br>  ""That's all right. We'll see 'bout that. Won't you stay fo' dinna?""    <br><br>  ""No, I thank you, sah; Ma'me Broz&eacute; already ask' me."" And Gilma strode away, down the beaten footpath that led across the sloping grassplot toward the outer road.   <br><br>  A definite destination and a settled purpose ahead of him seemed to have revived his flagging energies of an hour before. It was with no trace of fatigue that he stepped out bravely along the wagon-road that skirted the bayou.   <br><br>  It was early spring, and the cotton had already a good stand. In some places the negroes were hoeing. Gilma stopped alongside the rail fence and called to an old negress who was plying her hoe at no great distance.   <br><br>  ""Hello, Aunt Hal'fax! see yere.""    <br><br>  She turned, and immediately quitted her work to go and join him,, bringing her hoe with her across her shoulder. She was large- boned and very black. She was dressed in the deshabille of the field.   <br><br>  ""I wish you'd come up to yo' cabin with me a minute, Aunt Hally,"" he said; ""I want to get an aff'davit f'om you.""    <br><br>  She understood, after a fashion, what an affidavit was; but she couldn't see the good of it.   <br><br>  ""I ain't got no aff'davis, boy; you g'long an' don' pesta me.""    <br><br>  "" 'Twon't take you any time, Aunt Hal'fax. I jus' want you to put yo' mark to a statement I'm goin' to write to the effec' that my hoss, Jupe, is my own prop'ty; that you know it, an' willin' to swear to it.""    <br><br>  ""Who say Jupe don' b'long to you?"" she questioned cautiously, leaning on her hoe.   <br><br>  He motioned toward the house.   <br><br>  ""Who? Mista Septime and them?""    <br><br>  ""Yes.""    <br><br>  ""Well, I reckon!"" she exclaimed, sympathetically.   <br><br>  ""That's it,"" Gilma went on; ""an' nex' thing they'll be sayin' yo' ole mule, Policy, don't b'long to you.""    <br><br>  She started violently.   <br><br>  ""Who say so?""    <br><br>  ""Nobody. But I say, nex' thing, that' w'at they'll be sayin'.""    <br><br>  She began to move along the inside of the fence, and he turned to keep pace with her, walking on the grassy edge of the road.   <br><br>  ""I'll jus' write the aff'davit, Aunt Hally, an' all you got to do"" -   <br><br>  ""You know des well as me dat mule mine. I done paid ole Mista Gamiche fo' 'im in good cotton; dat year you falled outen de puckhorn tree; an' he write it down hisse'f in his 'count book.""    <br><br>  Gilma did not linger a moment after obtaining the desired statement from Aunt Halifax. With the first of those ""hundred affidavits"" that he hoped to secure, safe in his pocket, he struck out across the country, seeking the shortest way to town.   <br><br>  Aunt Halifax stayed in the cabin door.   <br><br>  ""'Relius,"" she shouted to a little black boy out in the road, ""does you see Pol'cy anywhar? G'long, see ef he 'roun' de ben'. Wouldn' s'prise me ef he broke de fence an' got in yo' pa's corn ag'in."" And, shading her eyes to scan the surrounding country, she muttered, uneasily: ""Whar dat mule?""    <br><br>  The following morning Gilma entered town and proceeded at once to Lawyer Paxton's office. He had had no difficulty in obtaining the testimony of blacks and whites regarding his ownership of the horse; but he wanted to make his claim as secure as possible by consulting the lawyer and returning to the plantation armed with unassailable evidence.    <br><br>  The lawyer's office was a plain little room opening upon the street. Nobody was there, but the door was open; and Gilma entered and took a seat at the bare round table and waited. It was not long before the lawyer came in; he had been in conversation with some one across the street.   <br><br>  ""Good-morning, Mr. Pax'on,"" said Gilma, rising.   <br><br>  The lawyer knew his face well enough, but could not place him, and only returned: ""Good-morning, sir - good-morning.""    <br><br>  ""I come to see you,"" began Gilma plunging at once into business, and drawing his handful of nondescript affidavits from his pocket, ""about a matter of prope'ty, about regaining possession of my hoss that Mr. Septime, ole Mr. Gamiche's nephew, is holdin' f'om me yonder.""    <br><br>  The lawyer took the papers and, adjusting his eye-glasses, began to look them through.   <br><br>  ""Yes, yes,"" he said; ""I see.""    <br><br>  ""Since Mr. Gamiche died on Tuesday"" - began Gilma.   <br><br>  ""Gamiche died!"" repeated Lawyer Paxton, with astonishment. ""Why, you don't mean to tell me that vieux Gamiche is dead? Well, well. I hadn't heard of it; I just returned from Shreveport this morning. So le vieux Gamiche is dead, is he? And you say you want to get possession of a horse. What did you say your name was?"" drawing a pencil from his pocket.   <br><br>  ""Gilma Germain is my name, suh.""    <br><br>  ""Gilma Germain,"" repeated the lawyer, a little meditatively, scanning his visitor closely. ""Yes, I recall your face now. You are the young fellow whom le vieux Gamiche took to live with him some ten or twelve years ago.""    <br><br>  ""Ten years ago las' November, suh.""    <br><br>  Lawyer Paxton arose and went to his safe, from which, after unlocking it, he took a legal-looking document that he proceeded to read carefully through to himself.   <br><br>  ""Well, Mr. Germain, I reckon there won't be any trouble about regaining possession of the horse,"" laughed Lawyer Paxton. ""I'm pleased to inform you, my dear sir, that our old friend, Gamiche, has made you sole heir to his property; that is, his plantation, including live stock, farming implements, machinery, household effects, etc. Quite a pretty piece of property,"" he proclaimed leisurely, seating himself comfortably for a long talk. ""And I may add, a pretty piece of luck, Mr. Germain, for a young fellow just starting out in life; nothing but to step into a dead man's shoes! A great chance - great chance. Do you know, sir, the moment you mentioned your name, it came back to me like a flash, how le vieux Gamiche came in here one day, about three years ago, and wanted to make his will"" - And the loquacious lawyer went on with his reminiscences and interesting bits of information, of which Gilma heard scarcely a word.   <br><br>  He was stunned, drunk, with the sudden joy of possession; the thought of what seemed to him great wealth, all his own - his own! It seemed as if a hundred different sensations were holding him at once, and as if a thousand intentions crowded upon him. He felt like another being who would have to readjust himself to the new conditions, presenting themselves so unexpectedly. The narrow confines of the office were stifling, and it seemed as if the lawyer's flow of talk would never stop. Gilma arose abruptly, and with a half-uttered apology, plunged from the room into the outer air.    <br><br>  Two days later Gilma stopped again before Aunt Halifax's cabin, on his way back to the plantation. He was walking as before, having declined to avail himself of any one of the several offers of a mount that had been tendered him in town and on the way. A rumor of Gilma's great good fortune had preceded him, and Aunt Halifax greeted him with an almost triumphal shout as he approached.   <br><br>  ""God knows you deserve it, Mista Gilma! De Lord knows you does, suh! Come in an' res' yo'se'f, suh. You, 'Relius! git out dis heah cabin; crowdin' up dat away!"" She wiped off the best chair available and offered it to Gilma.   <br><br>  He was glad to rest himself and glad to accept Aunt Halifax's proffer of a cup of coffee, which she was in the act of dripping before a small fire. He sat as far as he could from the fire, for the day was warm; he mopped his face, and fanned himself with his broad-rimmed hat.   <br><br>  ""I des' can't he'p laughin' w'en I thinks 'bout it,"" said the old woman, fairly shaking, as she leaned over the hearth. ""I wakes up in de night, even, an' has to laugh.""    <br><br>  ""How's that, Aunt Hal'fax,"" asked Gilma, almost tempted to laugh himself at he knew not what.   <br><br>  ""G'long, Mista Gilma! like you don' know! It's w'en I thinks 'bout Septime an' them like I gwine see 'em in dat wagon to-mor' mo'nin', on' dey way back to Caddo. Oh, lawsy!""    <br><br>  ""That isn' so ver' funny, Aunt Hal'fax,"" returned Gilma, feeling himself ill at ease as he accepted the cup of coffee which she presented to him with much ceremony on a platter. ""I feel pretty sorry for Septime, myse'f.""    <br><br>  ""I reckon he know now who Jupe b'long to,"" she went on, ignoring his expression of sympathy; ""no need to tell him who Pol'cy b'long to, nuther. An' I tell you, Mista Gilma,"" she went on, leaning upon the table without seating herself, ""dey gwine back to hard times in Caddo. I heah tell dey nuva gits 'nough to eat, yonda. Septime, he can't do nuttin' 'cep' set still all twis' up like a sarpint. An' Ma'me Broz&eacute;, she do some kine sewin'; but don't look like she got sense 'nough to do dat halfway. An' dem li'le gals, dey 'bleege to run bar'foot mos' all las' winta', twell dat li'les' gal, she got her heel plum fros' bit, so dey tells me. Oh, lawsy! How dey gwine look to-mor', all trapsin' back to Caddo!""    <br><br>  Gilma had never found Aunt Halifax's company so intensely disagreeable as at that moment. He thanked her for the coffee, and went away so suddenly as to startle her. But her good humor never flagged. She called out to him from the doorway:   <br><br>  ""Oh, Mista Gilma! You reckon dey knows who Pol'cy b'longs to now?""    <br><br>  He somehow did not feel quite prepared to face Septime; and he lingered along the road. He even stopped a while to rest, apparently, under the shade of a huge cottonwood tree that overhung the bayou. From the very first, a subtle uneasiness, a self-dissatisfaction had mingled with his elation, and he was trying to discover what it meant.    <br><br>  To begin with, the straightforwardness of his own nature had inwardly resented the sudden change in the bearing of most people toward himself. He was trying to recall, too, something which the lawyer had said; a little phrase, out of that multitude of words, that had fallen in his consciousness. It had stayed there, generating a little festering sore place that was beginning to make itself irritatingly felt. What was it, that little phrase? Something about - in his excitement he had only half heard it - something about dead men's shoes.   <br><br>  The exuberant health and strength of his big body; the courage, virility, endurance of his whole nature revolted against the expression in itself, and the meaning which it conveyed to him. Dead men's shoes! Were they not for such afflicted beings as Septime? as that helpless, dependent woman up there? as those two little ones, with their poorly fed, poorly clad bodies and sweet, appealing eyes? Yet he could not determine how he would act and what he would say to them.    <br><br>  But there was no room left in his heart for hesitancy when he came to face the group. Septime was still crouched in his uncle's chair; he seemed never to have left it since the day of the funeral. Ma'me Broz&eacute; had been crying, and so had the children - out of sympathy, perhaps.   <br><br>  ""Mr. Septime,"" said Gilma, approaching, ""I brought those aff'davits about the hoss. I hope you about made up yo' mind to turn it over without further trouble.""    <br><br>  Septime was trembling, bewildered, almost speechless.   <br><br>  ""W'at you mean?"" he faltered, looking up with a shifting, sideward glance. ""The whole place b'longs to you. You tryin' to make a fool out o' me?""    <br><br>  ""Fo' me,"" returned Gilma, ""the place can stay with Mr. Gamiche's own flesh an' blood. I'll see Mr. Pax'on again an' make that according to the law. But I want my hoss.""    <br><br>  Gilma took something besides his horse - a picture of le vieux Gamiche, which had stood on his mantelpiece. He thrust it into his pocket. He also took his old benefactor's walking-stick and a gun.    <br><br>  As he rode out of the gate, mounted upon his well-beloved ""Jupe,"" the faithful dog following, Gilma felt as if he had awakened from an intoxicating but depressing dream.                                       <br><br>"
62,Desiree's Baby,"  <b>1</b>   <br><br>       As the day was pleasant, Madame Valmonde drove over to L'Abri to see Desiree and the baby.      It made her laugh to think of Desiree with a baby. Why, it seemed but yesterday that Desiree was little more than a baby herself; when Monsieur in riding through the gateway of Valmonde had found her lying asleep in the shadow of the big stone pillar.      The little one awoke in his arms and began to cry for ""Dada."" That was as much as she could do or say. Some people thought she might have strayed there of her own accord, for she was of the toddling age. The prevailing belief was that she had been purposely left by a party of Texans, whose canvas-covered wagon, late in the day, had crossed the ferry that Coton Mais kept, just below the plantation. In time Madame Valmonde abandoned every speculation but the one that Desiree had been sent to her by a beneficent Providence to be the child of her affection, seeing that she was without child of the flesh. For the girl grew to be beautiful and gentle, affectionate and sincere - the idol of Valmonde.      It was no wonder, when she stood one day against the stone pillar in whose shadow she had lain asleep, eighteen years before, that Armand Aubigny riding by and seeing her there, had fallen in love with her. That was the way all the Aubignys fell in love, as if struck by a pistol shot. The wonder was that he had not loved her before; for he had known her since his father brought him home from Paris, a boy of eight, after his mother died there. The passion that awoke in him that day, when he saw her at the gate, swept along like an avalanche, or like a prairie fire, or like anything that drives headlong over all obstacles.      Monsieur Valmonde grew practical and wanted things well considered: that is, the girl's obscure origin. Armand looked into her eyes and did not care. He was reminded that she was nameless. What did it matter about a name when he could give her one of the oldest and proudest in Louisiana? He ordered the corbeille from Paris, and contained himself with what patience he could until it arrived; then they were married.        <br><br>  <b>2</b>   <br><br>      Madame Valmonde had not seen Desiree and the baby for four weeks. When she reached L'Abri she shuddered at the first sight of it, as she always did. It was a sad looking place, which for many years had not known the gentle presence of a mistress, old Monsieur Aubigny having married and buried his wife in France, and she having loved her own land too well ever to leave it. The roof came down steep and black like a cowl, reaching out beyond the wide galleries that encircled the yellow stuccoed house. Big, solemn oaks grew close to it, and their thick-leaved, far-reaching branches shadowed it like a pall. Young Aubigny's rule was a strict one, too, and under it his negroes had forgotten how to be gay, as they had been during the old master's easy-going and indulgent lifetime.      The young mother was recovering slowly, and lay full length, in her soft white muslins and laces, upon a couch. The baby was beside her, upon her arm, where he had fallen asleep, at her breast. The yellow nurse woman sat beside a window fanning herself.      Madame Valmonde bent her portly figure over Desiree and kissed her, holding her an instant tenderly in her arms. Then she turned to the child.      ""This is not the baby!"" she exclaimed, in startled tones. French was the language spoken at Valmonde in those days.      ""I knew you would be astonished,"" laughed Desiree, ""at the way he has grown. The little cochon de lait! Look at his legs, mamma, and his hands and fingernails - real finger-nails. Zandrine had to cut them this morning. Isn't it true, Zandrine?""      The woman bowed her turbaned head majestically, ""Mais si, Madame.""      ""And the way he cries,"" went on Desiree, ""is deafening. Armand heard him the other day as far away as La Blanche's cabin.""      Madame Valmonde had never removed her eyes from the child. She lifted it and walked with it over to the window that was lightest. She scanned the baby narrowly, then looked as searchingly at Zandrine, whose face was turned to gaze across the fields.      ""Yes, the child has grown, has changed,"" said Madame Valmonde, slowly, as she replaced it beside its mother. ""What does Armand say?""      Desiree's face became suffused with a glow that was happiness itself.          <br><br>  <b>3</b>   <br><br>      ""Oh, Armand is the proudest father in the parish, I believe, chiefly because it is a boy, to bear his name; though he says not - that he would have loved a girl as well. But I know it isn't true. I know he says that to please me. And mamma,"" she added, drawing Madame Valmonde's head down to her, and speaking in a whisper, ""he hasn't punished one of them - not one of them - since baby is born. Even Negrillon, who pretended to have burnt his leg that he might rest from work - he only laughed, and said Negrillon was a great scamp. Oh, mamma, I'm so happy; it frightens me.""      What Desiree said was true. Marriage, and later the birth of his son had softened Armand Aubigny's imperious and exacting nature greatly. This was what made the gentle Desiree so happy, for she loved him desperately. When he frowned she trembled, but loved him. When he smiled, she asked no greater blessing of God. But Armand's dark, handsome face had not often been disfigured by frowns since the day he fell in love with her.      When the baby was about three months old, Desiree awoke one day to the conviction that there was something in the air menacing her peace. It was at first too subtle to grasp. It had only been a disquieting suggestion; an air of mystery among the blacks; unexpected visits from far-off neighbors who could hardly account for their coming. Then a strange, an awful change in her husband's manner, which she dared not ask him to explain. When he spoke to her, it was with averted eyes, from which the old love-light seemed to have gone out. He absented himself from home; and when there, avoided her presence and that of her child, without excuse. And the very spirit of Satan seemed suddenly to take hold of him in his dealings with the slaves. Desiree was miserable enough to die.      She sat in her room, one hot afternoon, in her peignoir, listlessly drawing through her fingers the strands of her long, silky brown hair that hung about her shoulders. The baby, half naked, lay asleep upon her own great mahogany bed, that was like a sumptuous throne, with its satin-lined half-canopy. One of La Blanche's little quadroon boys - half naked too - stood fanning the child slowly with a fan of peacock feathers. Desiree's eyes had been fixed absently and sadly upon the baby, while she was striving to penetrate the threatening mist that she felt closing about her. She looked from her child to the boy who stood beside him, and back again; over and over. ""Ah!"" It was a cry that she could not help; which she was not conscious of having uttered. The blood turned like ice in her veins, and a clammy moisture gathered upon her face.  <br><br>  <b>4</b>   <br><br>      She tried to speak to the little quadroon boy; but no sound would come, at first. When he heard his name uttered, he looked up, and his mistress was pointing to the door. He laid aside the great, soft fan, and obediently stole away, over the polished floor, on his bare tiptoes.      She stayed motionless, with gaze riveted upon her child, and her face the picture of fright.      Presently her husband entered the room, and without noticing her, went to a table and began to search among some papers which covered it.      ""Armand,"" she called to him, in a voice which must have stabbed him, if he was human. But he did not notice. ""Armand,"" she said again. Then she rose and tottered towards him. ""Armand,"" she panted once more, clutching his arm, ""look at our child. What does it mean? Tell me.""      He coldly but gently loosened her fingers from about his arm and thrust the hand away from him. ""Tell me what it means!"" she cried despairingly.      ""It means,"" he answered lightly, ""that the child is not white; it means that you are not white.""      A quick conception of all that this accusation meant for her nerved her with unwonted courage to deny it. ""It is a lie; it is not true, I am white! Look at my hair, it is brown; and my eyes are gray, Armand, you know they are gray. And my skin is fair,"" seizing his wrist. ""Look at my hand; whiter than yours, Armand,"" she laughed hysterically.      ""As white as La Blanche's,"" he returned cruelly; and went away leaving her alone with their child.      When she could hold a pen in her hand, she sent a despairing letter to Madame Valmonde.      ""My mother, they tell me I am not white. Armand has told me I am not white. For God's sake tell them it is not true. You must know it is not true. I shall die. I must die. I cannot be so unhappy, and live.""      The answer that came was brief:      ""My own Desiree: Come home to Valmonde; back to your mother who loves you. Come with your child.""      When the letter reached Desiree she went with it to her husband's study, and laid it open upon the desk before which he sat. She was like a stone image: silent, white, motionless after she placed it there.  <br><br>  <b>5</b>   <br><br>      In silence he ran his cold eyes over the written words.      He said nothing. ""Shall I go, Armand?"" she asked in tones sharp with agonized suspense.      ""Yes, go.""      ""Do you want me to go?""      ""Yes, I want you to go.""      He thought Almighty God had dealt cruelly and unjustly with him; and felt, somehow, that he was paying Him back in kind when he stabbed thus into his wife's soul. Moreover he no longer loved her, because of the unconscious injury she had brought upon his home and his name.      She turned away like one stunned by a blow, and walked slowly towards the door, hoping he would call her back.      ""Good-by, Armand,"" she moaned.      He did not answer her. That was his last blow at fate.      Desiree went in search of her child. Zandrine was pacing the sombre gallery with it. She took the little one from the nurse's arms with no word of explanation, and descending the steps, walked away, under the live-oak branches.      It was an October afternoon; the sun was just sinking. Out in the still fields the negroes were picking cotton.      Desiree had not changed the thin white garment nor the slippers which she wore. Her hair was uncovered and the sun's rays brought a golden gleam from its brown meshes. She did not take the broad, beaten road which led to the far-off plantation of Valmonde. She walked across a deserted field, where the stubble bruised her tender feet, so delicately shod, and tore her thin gown to shreds.      She disappeared among the reeds and willows that grew thick along the banks of the deep, sluggish bayou; and she did not come back again.      Some weeks later there was a curious scene enacted at L'Abri. In the centre of the smoothly swept back yard was a great bonfire. Armand Aubigny sat in the wide hallway that commanded a view of the spectacle; and it was he who dealt out to a half dozen negroes the material which kept this fire ablaze.      A graceful cradle of willow, with all its dainty furbishings, was laid upon the pyre, which had already been fed with the richness of a priceless layette. Then there were silk gowns, and velvet and satin ones added to these; laces, too, and embroideries; bonnets and gloves; for the corbeille had been of rare quality.  <br><br>  <b>6</b>   <br><br>      The last thing to go was a tiny bundle of letters; innocent little scribblings that Desiree had sent to him during the days of their espousal. There was the remnant of one back in the drawer from which he took them. But it was not Desiree's; it was part of an old letter from his mother to his father. He read it. She was thanking God for the blessing of her husband's love:--      ""But above all,"" she wrote, ""night and day, I thank the good God for having so arranged our lives that our dear Armand will never know that his mother, who adores him, belongs to the race that is cursed with the brand of slavery.""   <br><br>"
63,Regret,"MAMZELLE AURLIE possessed a good strong figure, ruddy cheeks, hair that was changing from brown to gray, and a determined eye. She wore a man's hat about the farm, and an old blue army overcoat when it was cold, and sometimes top-boots.  <br><br>  Mamzelle Aurlie had never thought of marrying. She had never been in love. At the age of twenty she had received a proposal, which she had promptly declined, and at the age of fifty she had not yet lived to regret it.  <br><br>  So she was quite alone in the world, except for her dog Ponto, and the negroes who lived in her cabins and worked her crops, and the fowls, a few cows, a couple of mules, her gun (with which she shot chicken-hawks), and her religion.  <br><br>  One morning Mamzelle Aurlie stood upon her gallery, contemplating, with arms akimbo, a small band of very small children who, to all intents and purposes, might have fallen from the clouds, so unexpected and bewildering was their coming, and so unwelcome. They were the children of her nearest neighbor, Odile, who was not such a near neighbor, after all.  <br><br>  The young woman had appeared but five minutes before, accompanied by these four children. In her arms she carried little Lodie; she dragged Ti Nomme by an unwilling hand; while Marcline and Marclette followed with irresolute steps.  <br><br>  Her face was red and disfigured from tears and excitement. She had been summoned to a neighboring parish by the dangerous illness of her mother; her husband was away in Texas -- it seemed to her a million miles away; and Valsin was waiting with the mule-cart to drive her to the station.  <br><br>  ""It's no question, Mamzelle Aurlie; you jus' got to keep those youngsters fo' me tell I come back. Dieu sait, I wouldn' botha you with 'em if it was any otha way to do! Make 'em mine you, Mamzelle Aurlie; don' spare 'em. Me, there, I'm half crazy between the chil'ren, an' Lon not home, an' maybe not even to fine po' maman alive encore!"" -- a harrowing possibility which drove Odile to take a final hasty and convulsive leave of her disconsolate family.  <br><br>  She left them crowded into the narrow strip of shade on the porch of the long, low house; the white sunlight was beating in on the white old boards; some chickens were scratching in the grass at the foot of the steps, and one had boldly mounted, and was stepping heavily, solemnly, and aimlessly across the gallery. There was a pleasant odor of pinks in the air, and the sound of negroes' laughter was coming across the flowering cotton-field.  <br><br>  Mamzelle Aurlie stood contemplating the children. She looked with a critical eye upon Marcline, who had been left staggering beneath the weight of the chubby Lodie. She surveyed with the same calculating air Marclette mingling her silent tears with the audible grief and rebellion of Ti Nomme. During those few contemplative moments she was collecting herself, determining upon a line of action which should be identical with a line of duty. She began by feeding them.  <br><br>  If Mamzelle Aurlie's responsibilities might have begun and ended there, they could easily have been dismissed; for her larder was amply provided against an emergency of this nature. But little children are not little pigs: they require and demand attentions which were wholly unexpected by Mamzelle Aurlie, and which she was ill prepared to give.  <br><br>  She was, indeed, very inapt in her management of Odile's children during the first few days. How could she know that Marclette always wept when spoken to in a loud and commanding tone of voice? It was a peculiarity of Marclette's. She became acquainted with Ti Nomme's passion for flowers only when he had plucked all the choicest gardenias and pinks for the apparent purpose of critically studying their botanical construction.  <br><br>  ""'T ain't enough to tell 'im, Mamzelle Aurlie,"" Marcline instructed her; ""you got to tie 'im in a chair. It's w'at maman all time do w'en he's bad: she tie 'im in a chair."" The chair in which Mamzelle Aurlie tied Ti Nomme was roomy and comfortable, and he seized the opportunity to take a nap in it, the afternoon being warm.  <br><br>  At night, when she ordered them one and all to bed as she would have shooed the chickens into the hen-house, they stayed uncomprehending before her. What about the little white nightgowns that had to be taken from the pillow-slip in which they were brought over, and shaken by some strong hand till they snapped like ox-whips? What about the tub of water which had to be brought and set in the middle of the floor, in which the little tired, dusty, sun-browned feet had every one to be washed sweet and clean? And it made Marcline and Marclette laugh merrily -- the idea that Mamzelle Aurlie should for a moment have believed that Ti Nomme could fall asleep without being told the story of Croque-mitaine or Loup-garou, or both; or that lodie could fall asleep at all without being rocked and sung to.  <br><br>  ""I tell you, Aunt Ruby,"" Mamzelle Aurlie informed her cook in confidence; ""me, I'd rather manage a dozen plantation' than fo' chil'ren. It's terrassent! Bont! don't talk to me about chil'ren!""  <br><br>  ""T ain' ispected sich as you would know airy thing 'bout 'em, Mamzelle Aurlie. I see dat plainly yistiddy w'en I spy dat li'le chile playin' wid yo' baskit o' keys. You don' know dat makes chillun grow up hard-headed, to play wid keys? Des like it make 'em teeth hard to look in a lookin'-glass. Them's the things you got to know in the raisin' an' manigement o' chillun.""  <br><br>  Mamzelle Aurlie certainly did not pretend or aspire to such subtle and far-reaching knowledge on the subject as Aunt Ruby possessed, who had ""raised five an' buried six"" in her day. She was glad enough to learn a few little mother-tricks to serve the moment's need.  <br><br>  Ti Nomme's sticky fingers compelled her to unearth white aprons that she had not worn for years, and she had to accustom herself to his moist kisses -- the expressions of an affectionate and exuberant nature. She got down her sewing-basket, which she seldom used, from the top shelf of the armoire, and placed it within the ready and easy reach which torn slips and buttonless waists demanded. It took her some days to become accustomed to the laughing, the crying, the chattering that echoed through the house and around it all day long. And it was not the first or the second night that she could sleep comfortably with little Lodie's hot, plump body pressed close against her, and the little one's warm breath beating her cheek like the fanning of a bird's wing.  <br><br>  But at the end of two weeks Mamzelle Aurlie had grown quite used to these things, and she no longer complained.  <br><br>  It was also at the end of two weeks that Mamzelle Aurlie, one evening, looking away toward the crib where the cattle were being fed, saw Valsin's blue cart turning the bend of the road. Odile sat beside the mulatto, upright and alert. As they drew near, the young woman's beaming face indicated that her home-coming was a happy one.  <br><br>  But this coming, unannounced and unexpected, threw Mamzelle Aurlie into a flutter that was almost agitation. The children had to be gathered. Where was Ti Nomme? Yonder in the shed, putting an edge on his knife at the grindstone. And Marcline and Marclette? Cutting and fashioning doll-rags in the corner of the gallery. As for Lodie, she was safe enough in Mamzelle Aurlie's arms; and she had screamed with delight at sight of the familiar blue cart which was bringing her mother back to her.  <br><br>  THE excitement was all over, and they were gone. How still it was when they were gone! Mamzelle Aurlie stood upon the gallery, looking and listening. She could no longer see the cart; the red sunset and the blue-gray twilight had together flung a purple mist across the fields and road that hid it from her view. She could no longer hear the wheezing and creaking of its wheels. But she could still faintly hear the shrill, glad voices of the children.  <br><br>  She turned into the house. There was much work awaiting her, for the children had left a sad disorder behind them; but she did not at once set about the task of righting it. Mamzelle Aurlie seated herself beside the table. She gave one slow glance through the room, into which the evening shadows were creeping and deepening around her solitary figure. She let her head fall down upon her bended arm, and began to cry. Oh, but she cried! Not softly, as women often do. She cried like a man, with sobs that seemed to tear her very soul. She did not notice Ponto licking her hand.                             <br><br>"
64,The Kiss,"It was still quite light out of doors, but inside with the curtains drawn and the smouldering fire sending out a dim, uncertain glow, the room was full of deep shadows.<br><br>    Brantain sat in one of these shadows; it had overtaken him and he did not mind. The obscurity lent him courage to keep his eves fastened as ardently as he liked upon the girl who sat in the firelight.<br><br>    She was very handsome, with a certain fine, rich coloring that belongs to the healthy brune type. She was quite composed, as she idly stroked the satiny coat of the cat that lay curled in her lap, and she occasionally sent a slow glance into the shadow where her companion sat. They were talking low, of indifferent things which plainly were not the things that occupied their thoughts. She knew that he loved her--a frank, blustering fellow without guile enough to conceal his feelings, and no desire to do so. For two weeks past he had sought her society eagerly and persistently. She was confidently waiting for him to declare himself and she meant to accept him. The rather insignificant and unattractive Brantain was enormously rich; and she liked and required the entourage which wealth could give her.<br><br>    During one of the pauses between their talk of the last tea and the next reception the door opened and a young man entered whom Brantain knew quite well. The girl turned her face toward him. A stride or two brought him to her side, and bending over her chair--before she could suspect his intention, for she did not realize that he had not seen her visitor--he pressed an ardent, lingering kiss upon her lips.<br><br>    Brantain slowly arose; so did the girl arise, but quickly, and the newcomer stood between them, a little amusement and some defiance struggling with the confusion in his face.<br><br>    ""I believe,"" stammered Brantain, ""I see that I have stayed too long. I--I had no idea--that is, I must wish you good-by."" He was clutching his hat with both hands, and probably did not perceive that she was extending her hand to him, her presence of mind had not completely deserted her; but she could not have trusted herself to speak.<br><br>    ""Hang me if I saw him sitting there, Nattie! I know it's deuced awkward for you. But I hope you'll forgive me this once--this very first break. Why, what's the matter?""<br><br>    ""Don't touch me; don't come near me,"" she returned angrily. ""What do you mean by entering the house without ringing?""<br><br>    ""I came in with your brother, as I often do,"" he answered coldly, in self-justification. ""We came in the side way. He went upstairs and I came in here hoping to find you. The explanation is simple enough and ought to satisfy you that the misadventure was unavoidable. But do say that you forgive me, Nathalie,"" he entreated, softening.<br><br>    ""Forgive you! You don't know what you are talking about. Let me pass. It depends upon--a good deal whether I ever forgive you.""<br><br>    At that next reception which she and Brantain had been talking about she approached the young man with a delicious frankness of manner when she saw him there.<br><br>    ""Will you let me speak to you a moment or two, Mr. Brantain?"" she asked with an engaging but perturbed smile. He seemed extremely unhappy; but when she took his arm and walked away with him, seeking a retired corner, a ray of hope mingled with the almost comical misery of his expression. She was apparently very outspoken.<br><br>    ""Perhaps I should not have sought this interview, Mr. Brantain; but--but, oh, I have been very uncomfortable, almost miserable since that little encounter the other afternoon. When I thought how you might have misinterpreted it, and believed things"" --hope was plainly gaining the ascendancy over misery in Brantain's round, guileless face--""Of course, I know it is nothing to you, but for my own sake I do want you to understand that Mr. Harvy is an intimate friend of long standing. Why, we have always been like cousins--like brother and sister, I may say. He is my brother's most intimate associate and often fancies that he is entitled to the same privileges as the family. Oh, I know it is absurd, uncalled for, to tell you this; undignified even,"" she was almost weeping, ""but it makes so much difference to me what you think of--of me."" Her voice had grown very low and agitated. The misery had all disappeared from Brantain's face.<br><br>    ""Then you do really care what I think, Miss Nathalie? May I call you Miss Nathalie?"" They turned into a long, dim corridor that was lined on either side with tall, graceful plants. They walked slowly to the very end of it. When they turned to retrace their steps Brantain's face was radiant and hers was triumphant.<br><br>    Harvy was among the guests at the wedding; and he sought her out in a rare moment when she stood alone.<br><br>    ""Your husband,"" he said, smiling, ""has sent me over to kiss you. ""<br><br>    A quick blush suffused her face and round polished throat. ""I suppose it's natural for a man to feel and act generously on an occasion of this kind. He tells me he doesn't want his marriage to interrupt wholly that pleasant intimacy which has existed between you and me. I don't know what you've been telling him,"" with an insolent smile, ""but he has sent me here to kiss you.""<br><br>    She felt like a chess player who, by the clever handling of his pieces, sees the game taking the course intended. Her eyes were bright and tender with a smile as they glanced up into his; and her lips looked hungry for the kiss which they invited.<br><br>    ""But, you know,"" he went on quietly, ""I didn't tell him so, it would have seemed ungrateful, but I can tell you. I've stopped kissing women; it's dangerous.""<br><br>    Well, she had Brantain and his million left. A person can't have everything in this world; and it was a little unreasonable of her to expect it.                                     <br><br>"
65,The Locket,"    One night in autumn a few men were gathered about a fire on the slope of a hill. They belonged to a small detachment of Confederate forces and were awaiting orders to march. Their gray uniforms were worn beyond the point of shabbiness. One of the men was heating something in a tin cup over the embers. Two were lying at full length a little distance away, while a fourth was trying to decipher a letter and had drawn close to the light. He had unfastened his collar and a good bit of his flannel shirt front.<br><br>    ""What's that you got around your neck, Ned?"" asked one of the men lying in the obscurity.<br><br>    Ned--or Edmond--mechanically fastened another button of his shirt and did not reply. He went on reading his letter.<br><br>    ""Is it your sweet heart's picture?""<br><br>    ""`Taint no gal's picture,"" offered the man at the fire. He had removed his tin cup and was engaged in stirring its grimy contents with a small stick. ""That's a charm; some kind of hoodoo business that one o' them priests gave him to keep him out o' trouble. I know them Cath'lics. That's how come Frenchy got permoted an never got a scratch sence he's been in the ranks. Hey, French! aint I right?"" Edmond looked up absently from his letter.<br><br>    ""What is it?"" he asked.<br><br>    ""Aint that a charm you got round your neck?""<br><br>    ""It must be, Nick,"" returned Edmond with a smile. ""I don't know how I could have gone through this year and a half without it.""<br><br>    The letter had made Edmond heart sick and home sick. He stretched himself on his back and looked straight up at the blinking stars. But he was not thinking of them nor of anything but a certain spring day when the bees were humming in the clematis; when a girl was saying good bye to him. He could see her as she unclasped from her neck the locket which she fastened about his own. It was an old fashioned golden locket bearing miniatures of her father and mother with their names and the date of their marriage. It was her most precious earthly possession. Edmond could feel again the folds of the girl's soft white gown, and see the droop of the angel-sleeves as she circled her fair arms about his neck. Her sweet face, appealing, pathetic, tormented by the pain of parting, appeared before him as vividly as life. He turned over, burying his face in his arm and there he lay, still and motionless.<br><br>    The profound and treacherous night with its silence and semblance of peace settled upon the camp. He dreamed that the fair Octavie brought him a letter. He had no chair to offer her and was pained and embarrassed at the condition of his garments. He was ashamed of the poor food which comprised the dinner at which he begged her to join them.<br><br>    He dreamt of a serpent coiling around his throat, and when he strove to grasp it the slimy thing glided away from his clutch. Then his dream was clamor.<br><br>    ""Git your duds! you! Frenchy!"" Nick was bellowing in his face. There was what appeared to be a scramble and a rush rather than any regulated movement. The hill side was alive with clatter and motion; with sudden up-springing lights among the pines. In the east the dawn was unfolding out of the darkness. Its glimmer was yet dim in the plain below.<br><br>    ""What's it all about?"" wondered a big black bird perched in the top of the tallest tree. He was an old solitary and a wise one, yet he was not wise enough to guess what it was all about. So all day long he kept blinking and wondering.<br><br>    The noise reached far out over the plain and across the hills and awoke the little babes that were sleeping in their cradles. The smoke curled up toward the sun and shadowed the plain so that the stupid birds thought it was going to rain; but the wise one knew better.<br><br>    ""They are children playing a game,"" thought he. ""I shall know more about it if I watch long enough.""<br><br>    At the approach of night they had all vanished away with their din and smoke. Then the old bird plumed his feathers. At last he had understood! With a flap of his great, black wings he shot downward, circling toward the plain.<br><br>    A man was picking his way across the plain. He was dressed in the garb of a clergyman. His mission was to administer the consolations of religion to any of the prostrate figures in whom there might yet linger a spark of life. A negro accompanied him, bearing a bucket of water and a flask of wine.<br><br>    There were no wounded here; they had been borne away. But the retreat had been hurried and the vultures and the good Samaritans would have to look to the dead.<br><br>    There was a soldier--a mere boy--lying with his face to the sky. His hands were clutching the sward on either side and his finger nails were stuffed with earth and bits of grass that he had gathered in his despairing grasp upon life. His musket was gone; he was hatless and his face and clothing were begrimed. Around his neck hung a gold chain and locket. The priest, bending over him, unclasped the chain and removed it from the dead soldier's neck. He had grown used to the terrors of war and could face them unflinchingly; but its pathos, someway, always brought the tears to his old, dim eyes.<br><br>    The angelus was ringing half a mile away. The priest and the negro knelt and murmured together the evening benediction and a prayer for the dead.<br><br>    <b>II</b><br><br>    The peace and beauty of a spring day had descended upon the earth like a benediction. Along the leafy road which skirted a narrow, tortuous stream in central Louisiana, rumbled an old fashioned cabriolet, much the worse for hard and rough usage over country roads and lanes. The fat, black horses went in a slow, measured trot, notwithstanding constant urging on the part of the fat, black coachman. Within the vehicle were seated the fair Octavie and her old friend and neighbor, Judge Pillier, who had come to take her for a morning drive.<br><br>    Octavie wore a plain black dress, severe in its simplicity. A narrow belt held it at the waist and the sleeves were gathered into close fitting wristbands. She had discarded her hoopskirt and appeared not unlike a nun. Beneath the folds of her bodice nestled the old locket. She never displayed it now. It had returned to her sanctified in her eyes; made precious as material things sometimes are by being forever identified with a significant moment of one's existence.<br><br>    A hundred times she had read over the letter with which the locket had come back to her. No later than that morning she had again pored over it. As she sat beside the window, smoothing the letter out upon her knee, heavy and spiced odors stole in to her with the songs of birds and the humming of insects in the air.<br><br>    She was so young and the world was so beautiful that there came over her a sense of unreality as she read again and again the priest's letter. He told of that autumn day drawing to its close, with the gold and the red fading out of the west, and the night gathering its shadows to cover the faces of the dead. Oh! She could not believe that one of those dead was her own! with visage uplifted to the gray sky in an agony of supplication. A spasm of resistance and rebellion seized and swept over her. Why was the spring here with its flowers and its seductive breath if he was dead! Why was she here! What further had she to do with life and the living!<br><br>    Octavie had experienced many such moments of despair, but a blessed resignation had never failed to follow, and it fell then upon her like a mantle and enveloped her.<br><br>    ""I shall grow old and quiet and sad like poor Aunt Tavie,"" she murmured to herself as she folded the letter and replaced it in the secretary. Already she gave herself a little demure air like her Aunt Tavie. She walked with a slow glide in unconscious imitation of Mademoiselle Tavie whom some youthful affliction had robbed of earthly compensation while leaving her in possession of youth's illusions.<br><br>    As she sat in the old cabriolet beside the father of her dead lover, again there came to Octavie the terrible sense of loss which had assailed her so often before. The soul of her youth clamored for its rights; for a share in the world's glory and exultation. She leaned back and drew her veil a little closer about her face. It was an old black veil of her Aunt Tavie's. A whiff of dust from the road had blown in and she wiped her cheeks and her eyes with her soft, white handkerchief, a homemade handkerchief, fabricated from one of her old fine muslin petticoats.<br><br>    ""Will you do me the favor, Octavie,"" requested the judge in the courteous tone which he never abandoned, ""to remove that veil which you wear. It seems out of harmony, someway, with the beauty and promise of the day.""<br><br>    The young girl obediently yielded to her old companion's wish and unpinning the cumbersome, sombre drapery from her bonnet, folded it neatly and laid it upon the seat in front of her.<br><br>    ""Ah! that is better; far better!"" he said in a tone expressing unbounded relief. ""Never put it on again, dear."" Octavie felt a little hurt; as if he wished to debar her from share and parcel in the burden of affliction which had been placed upon all of them. Again she drew forth the old muslin handkerchief.<br><br>    They had left the big road and turned into a level plain which had formerly been an old meadow. There were clumps of thorn trees here and there, gorgeous in their spring radiance. Some cattle were grazing off in the distance in spots where the grass was tall and luscious. At the far end of the meadow was the towering lilac hedge, skirting the lane that led to Judge Pillier's house, and the scent of its heavy blossoms met them like a soft and tender embrace of welcome.<br><br>    As they neared the house the old gentleman placed an arm around the girl's shoulders and turning her face up to him he said: ""Do you not think that on a day like this, miracles might happen? When the whole earth is vibrant with life, does it not seem to you, Octavie, that heaven might for once relent and give us back our dead?"" He spoke very low, advisedly, and impressively. In his voice was an old quaver which was not habitual and there was agitation in every line of his visage. She gazed at him with eyes that were full of supplication and a certain terror of joy.<br><br>    They had been driving through the lane with the towering hedge on one side and the open meadow on the other. The horses had somewhat quickened their lazy pace. As they turned into the avenue leading to the house, a whole choir of feathered songsters fluted a sudden torrent of melodious greeting from their leafy hiding places.<br><br>    Octavie felt as if she had passed into a stage of existence which was like a dream, more poignant and real than life. There was the old gray house with its sloping eaves. Amid the blur of green, and dimly, she saw familiar faces and heard voices as if they came from far across the fields, and Edmond was holding her. Her dead Edmond; her living Edmond, and she felt the beating of his heart against her and the agonizing rapture of his kisses striving to awake her. It was as if the spirit of life and the awakening spring had given back the soul to her youth and bade her rejoice.<br><br>    It was many hours later that Octavie drew the locket from her bosom and looked at Edmond with a questioning appeal in her glance.<br><br>    ""It was the night before an engagement,"" he said. ""In the hurry of the encounter, and the retreat next day, I never missed it till the fight was over. I thought of course I had lost it in the heat of the struggle, but it was stolen.""<br><br>    ""Stolen,"" she shuddered, and thought of the dead soldier with his face uplifted to the sky in an agony of supplication.<br><br>    Edmond said nothing; but he thought of his messmate; the one who had lain far back in the shadow; the one who had said nothing.<br><br>"
66,The Night Came Slowly,"I am losing my interest in human beings; in the significance of their lives and their actions. Some one has said it is better to study one man than ten books. I want neither books nor men; they make me suffer. Can one of them talk to me like the night – the Summer night? Like the stars or the caressing wind?<br><br>The night came slowly, softly, as I lay out there under the maple tree. It came creeping, creeping stealthily out of the valley, thinking I did not notice. And the outlines of trees and foliage nearby blended in one black mass and the night came stealing out from them, too, and from the east and west, until the only light was in the sky, filtering through the maple leaves and a star looking down through every cranny.<br><br>The night is solemn and it means mystery.<br><br>Human shapes flitted by like intangible things. Some stole up like little mice to peep at me. I did not mind. My whole being was abandoned to the soothing and penetrating charm of the night.<br><br>The katydids began their slumber song: they are at it yet. How wise they are. They do not chatter like people. They tell me only: “sleep, sleep, sleep.” The wind rippled the maple leaves like little warm love thrills.<br><br>Why do fools cumber the Earth! It was a man’s voice that broke the necromancer’s spell. A man came to-day with his “Bible Class.” He is detestable with his red cheeks and bold eyes and coarse manner and speech. What does he know of Christ? Shall I ask a young fool who was born yesterday and will die tomorrow to tell me things of Christ? I would rather ask the stars: they have seen him.<br><br>"
67,The Recovery,"  She was a woman of thirty-five, possessing something of youthfulness. It was not the bloom, the softness, nor delicacy of coloring which had once been hers; those were all gone. It lurked rather in the expression of her sensitive face, which was at once appealing, pathetic, confiding.  <br><br>  For fifteen years she had lived in darkness with closed lids. By one of those seeming miracles of science, and by slow and gradual stages, the light had been restored to her. Now, for the first time in many years, she opened her eyes upon the full, mellow brightness of a June day.  <br><br>  She was alone. She had asked to be alone at the very first. Glad almost to ecstasy, she was yet afraid. She wanted first to see the light from her open window; to look at the dumb inanimate objects around her before gazing into the dear familiar faces that were stamped with sharp and vivid impress upon her mind.  <br><br>  And how beautiful was the world from her open window!  <br><br>  ""Oh, my God!"" she whispered, overcome. Her prayer could get no further. There were no words to utter her rapture and thanksgiving at beholding the blue unfathomable June sky; the rolling meadows, russet and green, reaching deep into the purple distance. Close beside her window the maple leaves rippled in the sun; flowers, rich and warm in color blossom beneath, and radiant-winged butterflies hovered sensuous in mid-air.  <br><br>  ""The world has not changed,"" she murmured; ""it has only grown more beautiful. Oh, I had forgotten how beautiful!""  <br><br>  Within her room were all the dear, dumb companions comforting her. How well she remembered them all! her mahogany table, bright and polished, just as it had stood fifteen years ago, with a crystal vase of roses and a few books ranged upon it. The sight of chairs, beds, pictures gave her keen joy. The carpet and draperies, even-- with their designs as much like the old ones as could be--seemed to her the same.  <br><br>  She touched with caressing fingers the French clock upon the mantel with its pompous little bronze figure of a last-century gentleman posing in buckles and frills beside the dial. She greeted him as an old friend, and delicately wiped his little bronze face with her soft handkerchief. As a child she had thought him an imposing figure. At a later and over-discriminating age she had patronized him as a poor bit of art. Now, nothing could have induced her to part with the old French clock and its little bronze bonhomme.  <br><br>  The mirror was over there in the corner. She had not forgotten it; oh, no, she had not forgotten, only she grew tremulous at the thought of it standing there. She held back, as a young girl who is going to confession is ashamed and afraid, and invites delay. But she had not forgotten.  <br><br>  ""This is folly,"" she uttered suddenly, passing the handkerchief nervously over her face. With quick resolution she crossed the room and faced her reflected image in the glass.  <br><br>  ""Mother!"" she cried, involuntarily, turning swiftly; but she was still alone. It had happened like a flash--an unreasoning impulse that knew not control or direction. She at once recovered herself and drew a deep breath. Again she wiped her forehead, that was a little clammy. She clutched the back of a low chair with her shaking hands and looked once more into the mirror. The veins in her wrists swelled like cords and throbbed.  <br><br>  You or I or anyone looking upon that same picture in the glass would have seen a rather well-preserved, stately blonde woman of thirty-five or more. Only God knows what she saw. It was something that held her with terrible fascination.  <br><br>  The eyes, above all, seemed to speak to her. Afflicted as they had been, they alone belonged to that old, other self that had somewhere vanished. She questioned, she challenged them. And while she looked down into their depths she drew into her soul all the crushing weight of the accumulated wisdom of years.  <br><br>  ""They lied; they all lied to me,"" she said, half aloud, never taking her eyes from those others. ""Mother, sisters, Robert--all, all of them lied.""  <br><br>  When the eyes in the glass had nothing more to tell her, she turned away from them. The pathos of her face had vanished; there was no longer the appeal that had been there a while ago; neither was there confidence.  <br><br>  The following day she walked abroad leaning upon the arm of the man whose untiring devotion to her had persisted for years. She would not fulfill her promise to marry him when blindness had overtaken her. He had endured the years of probation, wanting no other woman for his wife; living at her side when he could, and bringing himself close to her inner life by a warm, quick, watchful sympathy born of much love.  <br><br>  He was older than she--a man of splendid physique. The slim stripling of fifteen years ago was hardly the promise of this man of forty. His face had settled into a certain ruggedness accentuated by a few strong lines, and white hairs were beginning to show among the black ones on the temples.  <br><br>  They walked across the level stretch of lawn toward a sheltered garden seat no great distance away. She had spoken little since that moment of revelation before her mirror. Nothing had startled her after that. She was prepared for the changes which the years had wrought in all of them--mother, sisters, friends.  <br><br>  She seemed to be silently absorbing things, and would have lingered in ecstasy before a flower, or with her gaze penetrating the dense foliage beyond. Her senses had long been sharpened to the sounds and odors of the good, green world, and now her restored vision completed a sensuous impression such as she had never dreamed could be borne in upon a human consciousness.  <br><br>  He led her away to the bench. He fancied that seated he could better hold her attention to what was in his mind to say to her.  <br><br>  He took her hand in his. She was used to this and did not draw it away, but let it lie there.  <br><br>  ""Do you remember the old plans, Jane?"" he began, almost at once, ""all that we were to have done, to have seen, all that we were going to live together? How we had chosen to start away in the early spring time upon our travels--you and I--and only come back with the frosts of winter. You have not forgotten, dearest?"" He bent his face down over her hand and kissed it. ""The spring is over; but we have the summer with us, and God willing, the autumn and winter left to us. Tell me, Jane--tell me--speak to me!"" he entreated.  <br><br>  She looked into his face and then away, and back again, uncertainly.  <br><br>  ""I--oh, Robert,"" she said, gropingly, ""wait--I--the sight of things confuses me,"" and with a faint smile, ""I am not used; I must go back into the dark to think.""  <br><br>  He still held her hand, but she turned half away from him and buried her face in her arm that she leaned upon the back of the garden seat.  <br><br>  What could she hope to gather from the darkness that the light had not given her! She might hope, and she might wait and she might pray; but hope and prayer and waiting would avail her nothing.  <br><br>  The blessed light had given her back the world, life, love; but it had robbed her of her illusions; it had stolen away her youth.  <br><br>  He drew close to her, pressing his face near hers for his answer; and all that he heard was a little low sob.                                    <br><br>"
68,The Storm,"  <b>I</b>  <br><br>  The leaves were so still that even Bibi thought it was going to rain. Bobint, who was accustomed to converse on terms of perfect equality with his little son, called the child's attention to certain sombre clouds that were rolling with sinister intention from the west, accompanied by a sullen, threatening roar. They were at Friedheimer's store and decided to remain there till the storm had passed. They sat within the door on two empty kegs. Bibi was four years old and looked very wise.<br><br>    ""Mama'll be 'fraid, yes, he suggested with blinking eyes.<br><br>    ""She'll shut the house. Maybe she got Sylvie helpin' her this evenin',"" Bobint responded reassuringly.<br><br>    ""No; she ent got Sylvie. Sylvie was helpin' her yistiday,' piped Bibi.<br><br>    Bobint arose and going across to the counter purchased a can of shrimps, of which Calixta was very fond. Then he retumed to his perch on the keg and sat stolidly holding the can of shrimps while the storm burst. It shook the wooden store and seemed to be ripping great furrows in the distant field. Bibi laid his little hand on his father's knee and was not afraid.<br><br>    <b>II</b><br><br>    Calixta, at home, felt no uneasiness for their safety. She sat at a side window sewing furiously on a sewing machine. She was greatly occupied and did not notice the approaching storm. But she felt very warm and often stopped to mop her face on which the perspiration gathered in beads. She unfastened her white sacque at the throat. It began to grow dark, and suddenly realizing the situation she got up hurriedly and went about closing windows and doors.<br><br>    Out on the small front gallery she had hung Bobint's Sunday clothes to dry and she hastened out to gather them before the rain fell. As she stepped outside, Alce Laballire rode in at the gate. She had not seen him very often since her marriage, and never alone. She stood there with Bobint's coat in her hands, and the big rain drops began to fall. Alce rode his horse under the shelter of a side projection where the chickens had huddled and there were plows and a harrow piled up in the corner.<br><br>    ""May I come and wait on your gallery till the storm is over, Calixta?"" he asked.<br><br>    Come 'long in, M'sieur Alce.""<br><br>    His voice and her own startled her as if from a trance, and she seized Bobint's vest. Alce, mounting to the porch, grabbed the trousers and snatched Bibi's braided jacket that was about to be carried away by a sudden gust of wind. He expressed an intention to remain outside, but it was soon apparent that he might as well have been out in the open: the water beat in upon the boards in driving sheets, and he went inside, closing the door after him. It was even necessary to put something beneath the door to keep the water out.<br><br>    ""My! what a rain! It's good two years sence it rain' like that,"" exclaimed Calixta as she rolled up a piece of bagging and Alce helped her to thrust it beneath the crack.<br><br>    She was a little fuller of figure than five years before when she married; but she had lost nothing of her vivacity. Her blue eyes still retained their melting quality; and her yellow hair, dishevelled by the wind and rain, kinked more stubbornly than ever about her ears and temples.<br><br>    The rain beat upon the low, shingled roof with a force and clatter that threatened to break an entrance and deluge them there. They were in the dining room the sitting room the general utility room. Adjoining was her bed room, with Bibi's couch along side her own. The door stood open, and the room with its white, monumental bed, its closed shutters, looked dim and mysterious.<br><br>    Alce flung himself into a rocker and Calixta nervously began to gather up from the floor the lengths of a cotton sheet which she had been sewing.<br><br>    lf this keeps up, Dieu sait if the levees goin' to stan it!"" she exclaimed.<br><br>    ""What have you got to do with the levees?""<br><br>    ""I got enough to do! An' there's Bobint with Bibi out in that storm if he only didn' left Friedheimer's!""<br><br>    ""Let us hope, Calixta, that Bobint's got sense enough to come in out of a cyclone.""<br><br>    She went and stood at the window with a greatly disturbed look on her face. She wiped the frame that was clouded with moisture. It was stiflingly hot. Alce got up and joined her at the window, looking over her shoulder. The rain was coming down in sheets obscuring the view of far-off cabins and enveloping the distant wood in a gray mist. The playing of the lightning was incessant. A bolt struck a tall chinaberry tree at the edge of the field. It filled all visible space with a blinding glare and the crash seemed to invade the very boards they stood upon.<br><br>    Calixta put her hands to her eyes, and with a cry, staggered backward. Alce's arm encircled her, and for an instant he drew her close and spasmodically to him.<br><br>    ""Bont!"" she cried, releasing herself from his encircling arm and retreating from the window, the house'll go next! If I only knew w'ere Bibi was!"" She would not compose herself; she would not be seated. Alce clasped her shoulders and looked into her face. The contact of her warm, palpitating body when he had unthinkingly drawn her into his arms, had aroused all the old-time infatuation and desire for her flesh.<br><br>    ""Calixta,"" he said, ""don't be frightened. Nothing can happen. The house is too low to be struck, with so many tall trees standing about. There! aren't you going to be quiet? say, aren't you?"" He pushed her hair back from her face that was warm and steaming. Her lips were as red and moist as pomegranate seed. Her white neck and a glimpse of her full, firm bosom disturbed him powerfully. As she glanced up at him the fear in her liquid blue eyes had given place to a drowsy gleam that unconsciously betrayed a sensuous desire. He looked down into her eyes and there was nothing for him to do but to gather her lips in a kiss. It reminded him of Assumption.<br><br>    ""Do you rememberin Assumption, Calixta?"" he asked in a low voice broken by passion. Oh! she remembered; for in Assumption he had kissed her and kissed and kissed her; until his senses would well nigh fail, and to save her he would resort to a desperate flight. If she was not an immaculate dove in those days, she was still inviolate; a passionate creature whose very defenselessness had made her defense, against which his honor forbade him to prevail. Now well, now her lips seemed in a manner free to be tasted, as well as her round, white throat and her whiter breasts.<br><br>    They did not heed the crashing torrents, and the roar of the elements made her laugh as she lay in his arms. She was a revelation in that dim, mysterious chamber; as white as the couch she lay upon. Her firm, elastic flesh that was knowing for the first time its birthright, was like a creamy lily that the sun invites to contribute its breath and perfume to the undying life of the world.<br><br>    The generous abundance of her passion, without guile or trickery, was like a white flame which penetrated and found response in depths of his own sensuous nature that had never yet been reached.<br><br>    When he touched her breasts they gave themselves up in quivering ecstasy, inviting his lips. Her mouth was a fountain of delight. And when he possessed her, they seemed to swoon together at the very borderland of life's mystery.<br><br>    He stayed cushioned upon her, breathless, dazed, enervated, with his heart beating like a hammer upon her. With one hand she clasped his head, her lips lightly touching his forehead. The other hand stroked with a soothing rhythm his muscular shoulders.<br><br>    The growl of the thunder was distant and passing away. The rain beat softly upon the shingles, inviting them to drowsiness and sleep. But they dared not yield.<br><br>    <b>III</b><br><br>    The rain was over; and the sun was turning the glistening green world into a palace of gems. Calixta, on the gallery, watched Alce ride away. He turned and smiled at her with a beaming face; and she lifted her pretty chin in the air and laughed aloud.<br><br>    Bobint and Bibi, trudging home, stopped without at the cistern to make themselves presentable.<br><br>    ""My! Bibi, w'at will yo' mama say! You ought to be ashame'. You oughta' put on those good pants. Look at 'em! An' that mud on yo' collar! How you got that mud on yo' collar, Bibi? I never saw such a boy!"" Bibi was the picture of pathetic resignation. Bobint was the embodiment of serious solicitude as he strove to remove from his own person and his son's the signs of their tramp over heavy roads and through wet fields. He scraped the mud off Bibi's bare legs and feet with a stick and carefully removed all traces from his heavy brogans. Then, prepared for the worst the meeting with an over-scrupulous housewife, they entered cautiously at the back door.<br><br>    Calixta was preparing supper. She had set the table and was dripping coffee at the hearth. She sprang up as they came in.<br><br>    ""Oh, Bobint! You back! My! But I was uneasy. W'ere you been during the rain? An' Bibi? he ain't wet? he ain't hurt?"" She had clasped Bibi and was kissing him effusively. Bobint's explanations and apologies which he had been composing all along the way, died on his lips as Calixta felt him to see if he were dry, and seemed to express nothing but satisfaction at their safe return.<br><br>    ""I brought you some shrimps, Calixta,"" offered Bobint, hauling the can from his ample side pocket and laying it on the table.<br><br>    ""Shrimps! Oh, Bobint! you too good fo' anything!"" and she gave him a smacking kiss on the cheek that resounded, ""J'vous rponds, we'll have a feas' to-night! umph-umph!""<br><br>    Bobint and Bibi began to relax and enjoy themselves, and when the three seated themselves at table they laughed much and so loud that anyone might have heard them as far away as Laballire's.<br><br>    <b>IV</b><br><br>    Alce Laballire wrote to his wife, Clarisse, that night. It was a loving letter, full of tender solicitude. He told her not to hurry back, but if she and the babies liked it at Biloxi, to stay a month longer. He was getting on nicely; and though he missed them, he was willing to bear the separation a while longerrealizing that their health and pleasure were the first things to be considered.<br><br>    <b>V</b><br><br>    As for Clarisse, she was charmed upon receiving her husband's letter. She and the babies were doing well. The society was agreeable; many of her old friends and acquaintances were at the bay. And the first free breath since her marriage seemed to restore the pleasant liberty of her maiden days. Devoted as she was to her husband, their intimate conjugal life was something which she was more than willing to forego for a while.<br><br>    So the storm passed and every one was happy.                             <br><br>"
69,The Story of An Hour,"Knowing that Mrs. Mallard was afflicted with a heart trouble, great care was taken to break to her as gently as possible the news of her husband's death.<br><br>    It was her sister Josephine who told her, in broken sentences; veiled hints that revealed in half concealing. Her husband's friend Richards was there, too, near her. It was he who had been in the newspaper office when intelligence of the railroad disaster was received, with Brently Mallard's name leading the list of ""killed."" He had only taken the time to assure himself of its truth by a second telegram, and had hastened to forestall any less careful, less tender friend in bearing the sad message.<br><br>    She did not hear the story as many women have heard the same, with a paralyzed inability to accept its significance. She wept at once, with sudden, wild abandonment, in her sister's arms. When the storm of grief had spent itself she went away to her room alone. She would have no one follow her.<br><br>    There stood, facing the open window, a comfortable, roomy armchair. Into this she sank, pressed down by a physical exhaustion that haunted her body and seemed to reach into her soul.<br><br>    She could see in the open square before her house the tops of trees that were all aquiver with the new spring life. The delicious breath of rain was in the air. In the street below a peddler was crying his wares. The notes of a distant song which someone was singing reached her faintly, and countless sparrows were twittering in the eaves.<br><br>    There were patches of blue sky showing here and there through the clouds that had met and piled one above the other in the west facing her window.<br><br>    She sat with her head thrown back upon the cushion of the chair, quite motionless, except when a sob came up into her throat and shook her, as a child who has cried itself to sleep continues to sob in its dreams.<br><br>    She was young, with a fair, calm face, whose lines bespoke repression and even a certain strength. But now there was a dull stare in her eyes, whose gaze was fixed away off yonder on one of those patches of blue sky. It was not a glance of reflection, but rather indicated a suspension of intelligent thought.<br><br>    There was something coming to her and she was waiting for it, fearfully. What was it? She did not know; it was too subtle and elusive to name. But she felt it, creeping out of the sky, reaching toward her through the sounds, the scents, the color that filled the air.<br><br>    Now her bosom rose and fell tumultuously. She was beginning to recognize this thing that was approaching to possess her, and she was striving to beat it back with her will--as powerless as her two white slender hands would have been. When she abandoned herself a little whispered word escaped her slightly parted lips. She said it over and over under the breath: ""free, free, free!"" The vacant stare and the look of terror that had followed it went from her eyes. They stayed keen and bright. Her pulses beat fast, and the coursing blood warmed and relaxed every inch of her body.<br><br>    She did not stop to ask if it were or were not a monstrous joy that held her. A clear and exalted perception enabled her to dismiss the suggestion as trivial. She knew that she would weep again when she saw the kind, tender hands folded in death; the face that had never looked save with love upon her, fixed and gray and dead. But she saw beyond that bitter moment a long procession of years to come that would belong to her absolutely. And she opened and spread her arms out to them in welcome.<br><br>    There would be no one to live for during those coming years; she would live for herself. There would be no powerful will bending hers in that blind persistence with which men and women believe they have a right to impose a private will upon a fellow-creature. A kind intention or a cruel intention made the act seem no less a crime as she looked upon it in that brief moment of illumination.<br><br>    And yet she had loved him--sometimes. Often she had not. What did it matter! What could love, the unsolved mystery, count for in the face of this possession of self-assertion which she suddenly recognized as the strongest impulse of her being!<br><br>    ""Free! Body and soul free!"" she kept whispering.<br><br>    Josephine was kneeling before the closed door with her lips to the keyhole, imploring for admission. ""Louise, open the door! I beg; open the door--you will make yourself ill. What are you doing, Louise? For heaven's sake open the door.""<br><br>    ""Go away. I am not making myself ill."" No; she was drinking in a very elixir of life through that open window.<br><br>    Her fancy was running riot along those days ahead of her. Spring days, and summer days, and all sorts of days that would be her own. She breathed a quick prayer that life might be long. It was only yesterday she had thought with a shudder that life might be long.<br><br>    She arose at length and opened the door to her sister's importunities. There was a feverish triumph in her eyes, and she carried herself unwittingly like a goddess of Victory. She clasped her sister's waist, and together they descended the stairs. Richards stood waiting for them at the bottom.<br><br>    Someone was opening the front door with a latchkey. It was Brently Mallard who entered, a little travel-stained, composedly carrying his grip-sack and umbrella. He had been far from the scene of the accident, and did not even know there had been one. He stood amazed at Josephine's piercing cry; at Richards' quick motion to screen him from the view of his wife.<br><br>    When the doctors came they said she had died of heart disease--of the joy that kills.                                <br><br>"
70,The Unexpected,"  When Randall, for a brief absence, left his Dorothea, whom he was to marry after a time, the parting was bitter; the enforced separation seemed to them too cruel an ordeal to bear. The good-bye dragged with lingering kisses and sighs, and more kisses and more clinging till the last wrench came.  <br><br>  He was to return at the close of the month. Daily letters, impassioned and interminable, passed between them.  <br><br>  He did not return at the close of the month; he was delayed by illness. A heavy cold, accompanied by fever, contracted in some unaccountable way, held him to his bed. He hoped it would be over and that he would rejoin her in a week. But this was a stubborn cold, that seemed not to yield to familiar treatment; yet the physician was not discouraged, and promised to have him on his feet in a fortnight.  <br><br>  All this was torture to the impatient Dorothea; and if her parents had permitted, she surely would have hastened to the bedside of her beloved.  <br><br>  For a long interval he could not write himself. One day he seemed better; another day a ""fresh cold"" seized him with relentless clutch; and so a second month went by, and Dorothea had reached the limit of her endurance.  <br><br>  Then a tremulous scrawl came from him, saying he would be obliged to pass a season at the south; but he would first revisit his home, if only for a day, to clasp his dearest one to his heart, to appease the hunger for her presence, the craving for her lips that had been devouring him through all the fever and pain of this detestable illness.  <br><br>  Dorothea had read his impassioned letters almost to tatters. She had sat daily gazing for hours upon his portrait, which showed him to be an almost perfect specimen of youthful health, strength and manly beauty.  <br><br>  She knew he would be altered in appearance--he had prepared her, and had even written that she would hardly know him. She expected to see him ill and wasted; she would not seem shocked; she would not let him see astonishment or pain in her face. She was in a quiver of anticipation, a sensuous fever of expectancy till he came.  <br><br>  She sat beside him on the sofa, for after the first delirious embrace he had been unable to hold himself upon his tottering feet, and had sunk exhausted in a corner of the sofa. He threw his head back upon the cushions and stayed, with closed eyes, panting; all the strength of his body had concentrated in the clasp--the grasp with which he clung to her hand.  <br><br>  She stared at him as one might look upon a curious apparition which inspired wonder and mistrust rather than fear. This was not the man who had gone away from her; the man she loved and had promised to marry. What hideous transformation had he undergone, or what devilish transformation was she undergoing in contemplating him? His skin was waxy and hectic, red upon the cheek-bones. His eyes were sunken; his features pinched and prominent; and his clothing hung loosely upon his wasted frame. The lips with which he had kissed her so hungrily, and with which he was kissing her now, were dry and parched, and his breath was feverish and tainted.  <br><br>  At the sight and the touch of him something within her seemed to be shuddering, shrinking, shriveling together, losing all semblance of what had been. She felt as if it was her heart; but it was only her love.  <br><br>  ""This is the way my uncle Archibald went--in a gallop--you know."" He spoke with a certain derision and in little gasps as if breath were failing him. ""There's no danger of that for me, of course, once I get south; but the doctors won't answer for me if I stay here during the coming fall and winter.""  <br><br>  Then he held her in his arms with what seemed to be a frenzy of passion; a keen and quickened desire beside which his former and healthful transports were tempered and lukewarm by comparison.  <br><br>  ""We need not wait, Dorothea,"" he whispered. ""We must not put it off. Let the marriage be at once, and you will come with me and be with me. Oh, God! I feel as if I would never let you go; as if I must hold you in my arms forever, night and day, and always!""  <br><br>  She attempted to withdraw from his embrace. She begged him not to think of it, and tried to convince him that it was impossible.  <br><br>  ""I would only be a hindrance, Randall. You will come back well and strong; it will be time enough then,"" and to herself she was saying: ""never, never, never!"" There was a long silence, and he had closed his eyes again.  <br><br>  ""For another reason, my Dorothea,"" and then he waited again, as one hesitates through shame or through fear, to speak. ""I am quite -- almost sure I shall get well; but the strongest of us cannot count upon life. If the worst should come I want you to have all I possess; what fortune I have must be yours, and marriage will make my wish secure. Now I'm getting morbid."" He ended with a laugh that died away in a cough which threatened to wrench the breath from his body, and which brought the attendant, who had waited without, quickly to his side.  <br><br>  Dorothea watched him from the window descend the steps, leaning upon the man's arm, and saw him enter his carriage and fall helpless and exhausted as he had sunk an hour before in the corner of her sofa.  <br><br>  She was glad there was no one present to compel her to speak. She stayed at the window as if dazed, looking fixedly at the spot where the carriage had stood. A clock on the mantel striking the hour finally roused her, and she realized that there would soon be people appearing whom she would be forced to face and speak to.  <br><br>  Fifteen minutes later Dorothea had changed her house gown, had mounted her ""wheel,"" and was fleeing as if Death himself pursued her.  <br><br>  She sped along the familiar roadway, seemingly borne on by some force other than mechanical-some unw onted energy--a stubborn impulse that lighted her eyes, set her cheeks aflame, bent her supple body to one purpose--that was, swiftest flight.  <br><br>  How far, and how long did she go? She did not know; she did not care. The country about her grew unfamiliar. She was on a rough, unfrequented road, where the birds in the wayside brooks seemed unafraid. She could perceive no human habitation; an old fallow field, a stretch of wood, great trees bending thick-leaved branches languidly, and flinging long, inviting shadows about the road; the woody smell of summer; the drone of the insects; the sky and the clouds, and the quivering, lambent air. She was alone with nature; her pulses beating in unison with its sensuous throb, as she stopped and stretched herself upon the sward. Every muscle, nerve, fibre abandoned itself to the delicious sensation of rest that overtook and crept tingling through the whole length of her body.  <br><br>  She had never spoken a word after bidding him good-by; but now she seemed disposed to make confidants of the tremulous leaves, or the crawling and hopping insects, or the big sky into which she was staring.  <br><br>  ""Never!"" she whispered, ""not for all his thousands! Never, never! not for millions!""                                    <br><br>"
71,According To Their Lights,"  Somewhere in the depths of the big city, where the unquiet dregs are  forever being shaken together, young Murray and the Captain had met  and become friends. Both were at the lowest ebb possible to their  fortunes; both had fallen from at least an intermediate Heaven of  respectability and importance, and both were typical products of the  monstrous and peculiar social curriculum of their overweening and  bumptious civic alma mater.  <br><br>  The captain was no longer a captain. One of those sudden moral  cataclysms that sometimes sweep the city had hurled him from a high  and profitable position in the Police Department, ripping off his  badge and buttons and washing into the hands of his lawyers the  solid pieces of real estate that his frugality had enabled him to  accumulate. The passing of the flood left him low and dry. One month  after his dishabilitation a saloon-keeper plucked him by the neck  from his free-lunch counter as a tabby plucks a strange kitten from  her nest, and cast him asphaltward. This seems low enough. But after  that he acquired a pair of cloth top, button Congress gaiters and  wrote complaining letters to the newspapers. And then he fought  the attendant at the Municipal Lodging House who tried to give  him a bath. When Murray first saw him he was holding the hand of  an Italian woman who sold apples and garlic on Essex street, and  quoting the words of a song book ballad.  <br><br>  Murray's fall had been more Luciferian, if less spectacular. All  the pretty, tiny little kickshaws of Gotham had once been his. The  megaphone man roars out at you to observe the house of his uncle on  a grand and revered avenue. But there had been an awful row about  something, and the prince had been escorted to the door by the  butler, which, in said avenue, is equivalent to the impact of the  avuncular shoe. A weak Prince Hal, without inheritance or sword, he  drifted downward to meet his humorless Falstaff, and to pick the  crusts of the streets with him.  <br><br>  One evening they sat on a bench in a little downtown park. The great  bulk of the Captain, which starvation seemed to increase--drawing  irony instead of pity to his petitions for aid--was heaped against  the arm of the bench in a shapeless mass. His red face, spotted by  tufts of vermilion, week-old whiskers and topped by a sagging white  straw hat, looked, in the gloom, like one of those structures that  you may observe in a dark Third avenue window, challenging your  imagination to say whether it be something recent in the way of  ladies' hats or a strawberry shortcake. A tight-drawn belt--last  relic of his official spruceness--made a deep furrow in his  circumference. The Captain's shoes were buttonless. In a smothered  bass he cursed his star of ill-luck.  <br><br>  Murray, at his side, was shrunk into his dingy and ragged suit of  blue serge. His hat was pulled low; he sat quiet and a little  indistinct, like some ghost that had been dispossessed.  <br><br>  ""I'm hungry,"" growled the Captain--""by the top sirloin of the Bull  of Bashan, I'm starving to death. Right now I could eat a Bowery  restaurant clear through to the stovepipe in the alley. Can't  you think of nothing, Murray? You sit there with your shoulders  scrunched up, giving an imitation of Reginald Vanderbilt driving  his coach--what good are them airs doing you now? Think of some  place we can get something to chew.""  <br><br>  ""You forget, my dear Captain,"" said Murray, without moving, ""that  our last attempt at dining was at my suggestion.""  <br><br>  ""You bet it was,"" groaned the Captain, ""you bet your life it was.  Have you got any more like that to make--hey?""  <br><br>  ""I admit we failed,"" sighed Murray. ""I was sure Malone would be good  for one more free lunch after the way he talked baseball with me the  last time I spent a nickel in his establishment.""  <br><br>  ""I had this hand,"" said the Captain, extending the unfortunate  member--""I had this hand on the drumstick of a turkey and two  sardine sandwiches when them waiters grabbed us.""  <br><br>  ""I was within two inches of the olives,"" said Murray. ""Stuffed  olives. I haven't tasted one in a year.""  <br><br>  ""What'll we do?"" grumbled the Captain. ""We can't starve.""  <br><br>  ""Can't we?"" said Murray quietly. ""I'm glad to hear that. I was  afraid we could.""  <br><br>  ""You wait here,"" said the Captain, rising, heavily and puffily to  his feet. ""I'm going to try to make one more turn. You stay here  till I come back, Murray. I won't be over half an hour. If I turn  the trick I'll come back flush.""  <br><br>  He made some elephantine attempts at smartening his appearance. He  gave his fiery mustache a heavenward twist; he dragged into sight a  pair of black-edged cuffs, deepened the crease in his middle by  tightening his belt another hole, and set off, jaunty as a zoo  rhinoceros, across the south end of the park.  <br><br>  When he was out of sight Murray also left the park, hurrying swiftly  eastward. He stopped at a building whose steps were flanked by two  green lights.  <br><br>  ""A police captain named Maroney,"" he said to the desk sergeant, ""was  dismissed from the force after being tried under charges three years  ago. I believe sentence was suspended. Is this man wanted now by the  police?""  <br><br>  ""Why are ye asking?"" inquired the sergeant, with a frown.  <br><br>  ""I thought there might be a reward standing,"" explained Murray,  easily. ""I know the man well. He seems to be keeping himself pretty  shady at present. I could lay my hands on him at any time. If there  should be a reward--""  <br><br>  ""There's no reward,"" interrupted the sergeant, shortly. ""The man's  not wanted. And neither are ye. So, get out. Ye are frindly with um,  and ye would be selling um. Out with ye quick, or I'll give ye a  start.""  <br><br>  Murray gazed at the officer with serene and virtuous dignity.  <br><br>  ""I would be simply doing my duty as a citizen and gentleman,"" he  said, severely, ""if I could assist the law in laying hold of one of  its offenders.""  <br><br>  Murray hurried back to the bench in the park. He folded his arms and  shrank within his clothes to his ghost-like presentment.  <br><br>  Ten minutes afterward the Captain arrived at the rendezvous, windy  and thunderous as a dog-day in Kansas. His collar had been torn  away; his straw hat had been twisted and battered; his shirt with  ox-blood stripes split to the waist. And from head to knee he  was drenched with some vile and ignoble greasy fluid that loudly  proclaimed to the nose its component leaven of garlic and kitchen  stuff.  <br><br>  ""For Heaven's sake, Captain,"" sniffed Murray, ""I doubt that I would  have waited for you if I had suspected you were so desperate as to  resort to swill barrels. I""--  <br><br>  ""Cheese it,"" said the Captain, harshly. ""I'm not hogging it yet.  It's all on the outside. I went around on Essex and proposed  marriage to that Catrina that's got the fruit shop there. Now, that  business could be built up. She's a peach as far as a Dago could be.  I thought I had that senoreena mashed sure last week. But look what  she done to me! I guess I got too fresh. Well there's another scheme  queered.""  <br><br>  ""You don't mean to say,"" said Murray, with infinite contempt, ""that  you would have married that woman to help yourself out of your  disgraceful troubles!""  <br><br>  ""Me?"" said the Captain. ""I'd marry the Empress of China for one bowl  of chop suey. I'd commit murder for a plate of beef stew. I'd steal  a wafer from a waif. I'd be a Mormon for a bowl of chowder.""  <br><br>  ""I think,"" said Murray, resting his head on his hands, ""that I would  play Judas for the price of one drink of whiskey. For thirty pieces  of silver I would""--  <br><br>  ""Oh, come now!"" exclaimed the Captain in dismay. ""You wouldn't do  that, Murray! I always thought that Kike's squeal on his boss was  about the lowest-down play that ever happened. A man that gives his  friend away is worse than a pirate.""  <br><br>  Through the park stepped a large man scanning the benches where the  electric light fell.  <br><br>  ""Is that you, Mac?"" he said, halting before the derelicts. His  diamond stickpin dazzled. His diamond-studded fob chain assisted.  He was big and smooth and well fed. ""Yes, I see it's you,"" he  continued. ""They told me at Mike's that I might find you over here.  Let me see you a few minutes, Mac.""  <br><br>  The Captain lifted himself with a grunt of alacrity. If Charlie  Finnegan had come down in the bottomless pit to seek him there must  be something doing. Charlie guided him by an arm into a patch of  shadow.  <br><br>  ""You know, Mac,"" he said, ""they're trying Inspector Pickering on  graft charges.""  <br><br>  ""He was my inspector,"" said the Captain.  <br><br>  ""O'Shea wants the job,"" went on Finnegan. ""He must have it. It's for  the good of the organization. Pickering must go under. Your testimony  will do it. He was your 'man higher up' when you were on the force.  His share of the boodle passed through your hands. You must go on the  stand and testify against him.""  <br><br>  ""He was""--began the Captain.  <br><br>  ""Wait a minute,"" said Finnegan. A bundle of yellowish stuff came out  of his inside pocket. ""Five hundred dollars in it for you. Two-fifty  on the spot, and the rest""--  <br><br>  ""He was my friend, I say,"" finished the Captain. ""I'll see you and  the gang, and the city, and the party in the flames of Hades before  I'll take the stand against Dan Pickering. I'm down and out; but I'm  no traitor to a man that's been my friend."" The Captain's voice rose  and boomed like a split trombone. ""Get out of this park, Charlie  Finnegan, where us thieves and tramps and boozers are your betters;  and take your dirty money with you.""  <br><br>  Finnegan drifted out by another walk. The Captain returned to his  seat.  <br><br>  ""I couldn't avoid hearing,"" said Murray, drearily. ""I think you are  the biggest fool I ever saw.""  <br><br>  ""What would you have done?"" asked the Captain.  <br><br>  ""Nailed Pickering to the cross,"" said Murray.  <br><br>  ""Sonny,"" said the Captain, huskily and without heat. ""You and me are  different. New York is divided into two parts--above Forty-second  street, and below Fourteenth. You come from the other part. We both  act according to our lights.""  <br><br>  An illuminated clock above the trees retailed the information that  it lacked the half hour of twelve. Both men rose from the bench and  moved away together as if seized by the same idea. They left the  park, struck through a narrow cross street, and came into Broadway,  at this hour as dark, echoing and de-peopled as a byway in Pompeii.  <br><br>  Northward they turned; and a policeman who glanced at their unkempt  and slinking figures withheld the attention and suspicion that he  would have granted them at any other hour and place. For on every  street in that part of the city other unkempt and slinking figures  were shuffling and hurrying toward a converging point--a point that  is marked by no monument save that groove on the pavement worn by  tens of thousands of waiting feet.  <br><br>  At Ninth street a tall man wearing an opera hat alighted from a  Broadway car and turned his face westward. But he saw Murray,  pounced upon him and dragged him under a street light. The Captain  lumbered slowly to the corner, like a wounded bear, and waited,  growling.  <br><br>  ""Jerry!"" cried the hatted one. ""How fortunate! I was to begin a  search for you to-morrow. The old gentleman has capitulated. You're  to be restored to favor. Congratulate you. Come to the office in the  morning and get all the money you want. I've liberal instructions in  that respect.""  <br><br>  ""And the little matrimonial arrangement?"" said Murray, with his head  turned sidewise.  <br><br>  ""Why.--er--well, of course, your uncle understands--expects that  the engagement between you and Miss Vanderhurst shall be""--  <br><br>  ""Good night,"" said Murray, moving away.  <br><br>  ""You madman!"" cried the other, catching his arm. ""Would you give up  two millions on account of""--  <br><br>  ""Did you ever see her nose, old man?"" asked Murray, solemnly.  <br><br>  ""But, listen to reason, Jerry. Miss Vanderhurst is an heiress,  and""--  <br><br>  ""Did you ever see it?""  <br><br>  ""Yes, I admit that her nose isn't""--  <br><br>  ""Good night!"" said Murray. ""My friend is waiting for me. I am  quoting him when I authorize you to report that there is 'nothing  doing.' Good night.""  <br><br>  A wriggling line of waiting men extended from a door in Tenth street  far up Broadway, on the outer edge of the pavement. The Captain and  Murray fell in at the tail of the quivering millipede.  <br><br>  ""Twenty feet longer than it was last night,"" said Murray, looking up  at his measuring angle of Grace Church.  <br><br>  ""Half an hour,"" growled the Captain, ""before we get our punk.""  <br><br>  The city clocks began to strike 12; the Bread Line moved forward  slowly, its leathern feet sliding on the stones with the sound of a  hissing serpent, as they who had lived according to their lights  closed up in the rear.                             <br><br>"
72,A Double-Dyed Deceiver,"The trouble began in Laredo. It was the Llano Kid's fault, for he  should have confined his habit of manslaughter to Mexicans. But the  Kid was past twenty; and to have only Mexicans to one's credit at  twenty is to blush unseen on the Rio Grande border.<br><br>    It happened in old Justo Valdos's gambling house. There was a poker  game at which sat players who were not all friends, as happens often  where men ride in from afar to shoot Folly as she gallops. There was a  row over so small a matter as a pair of queens; and when the smoke had  cleared away it was found that the Kid had committed an indiscretion,  and his adversary had been guilty of a blunder. For, the unfortunate  combatant, instead of being a Greaser, was a high-blooded youth from  the cow ranches, of about the Kid's own age and possessed of friends  and champions. His blunder in missing the Kid's right ear only a  sixteenth of an inch when he pulled his gun did not lessen the  indiscretion of the better marksman.<br><br>    The Kid, not being equipped with a retinue, nor bountifully supplied  with personal admirers and supporters--on account of a rather  umbrageous reputation, even for the border--considered it not  incompatible with his indispensable gameness to perform that judicious  tractional act known as ""pulling his freight.""<br><br>    Quickly the avengers gathered and sought him. Three of them overtook  him within a rod of the station. The Kid turned and showed his teeth  in that brilliant but mirthless smile that usually preceded his deeds  of insolence and violence, and his pursuers fell back without making  it necessary for him even to reach for his weapon.<br><br>    But in this affair the Kid had not felt the grim thirst for encounter  that usually urged him on to battle. It had been a purely chance row,  born of the cards and certain epithets impossible for a gentleman to  brook that had passed between the two. The Kid had rather liked the  slim, haughty, brown-faced young chap whom his bullet had cut off in  the first pride of manhood. And now he wanted no more blood. He wanted  to get away and have a good long sleep somewhere in the sun on the  mesquit grass with his handkerchief over his face. Even a Mexican  might have crossed his path in safety while he was in this mood.<br><br>    The Kid openly boarded the north-bound passenger train that departed  five minutes later. But at Webb, a few miles out, where it was flagged  to take on a traveller, he abandoned that manner of escape. There were  telegraph stations ahead; and the Kid looked askance at electricity  and steam. Saddle and spur were his rocks of safety.<br><br>    The man whom he had shot was a stranger to him. But the Kid knew that  he was of the Coralitos outfit from Hidalgo; and that the punchers  from that ranch were more relentless and vengeful than Kentucky  feudists when wrong or harm was done to one of them. So, with the  wisdom that has characterized many great farmers, the Kid decided to  pile up as many leagues as possible of chaparral and pear between  himself and the retaliation of the Coralitos bunch.<br><br>    Near the station was a store; and near the store, scattered among the  mesquits and elms, stood the saddled horses of the customers. Most of  them waited, half asleep, with sagging limbs and drooping heads. But  one, a long-legged roan with a curved neck, snorted and pawed the  turf. Him the Kid mounted, gripped with his knees, and slapped gently  with the owner's own quirt.<br><br>    If the slaying of the temerarious card-player had cast a cloud over  the Kid's standing as a good and true citizen, this last act of his  veiled his figure in the darkest shadows of disrepute. On the Rio  Grande border if you take a man's life you sometimes take trash; but  if you take his horse, you take a thing the loss of which renders him  poor, indeed, and which enriches you not--if you are caught. For the  Kid there was no turning back now.<br><br>    With the springing roan under him he felt little care or uneasiness.  After a five-mile gallop he drew it in to the plainsman's jogging  trot, and rode northeastward toward the Nueces River bottoms. He knew  the country well--its most tortuous and obscure trails through the  great wilderness of brush and pear, and its camps and lonesome ranches  where one might find safe entertainment. Always he bore to the east;  for the Kid had never seen the ocean, and he had a fancy to lay his  hand upon the mane of the great Gulf, the gamesome colt of the greater  waters.<br><br>    So after three days he stood on the shore at Corpus Christi, and  looked out across the gentle ripples of a quiet sea.<br><br>    Captain Boone, of the schooner /Flyaway/, stood near his skiff, which  one of his crew was guarding in the surf. When ready to sail he had  discovered that one of the necessaries of life, in the  parallelogrammatic shape of plug tobacco, had been forgotten. A sailor  had been dispatched for the missing cargo. Meanwhile the captain paced  the sands, chewing profanely at his pocket store.<br><br>    A slim, wiry youth in high-heeled boots came down to the water's edge.  His face was boyish, but with a premature severity that hinted at a  man's experience. His complexion was naturally dark; and the sun and  wind of an outdoor life had burned it to a coffee brown. His hair was  as black and straight as an Indian's; his face had not yet upturned to  the humiliation of a razor; his eyes were a cold and steady blue. He  carried his left arm somewhat away from his body, for pearl-handled  .45s are frowned upon by town marshals, and are a little bulky when  placed in the left armhole of one's vest. He looked beyond Captain  Boone at the gulf with the impersonal and expressionless dignity of a  Chinese emperor.<br><br>    ""Thinkin' of buyin' that'ar gulf, buddy?"" asked the captain, made  sarcastic by his narrow escape from a tobaccoless voyage.<br><br>    ""Why, no,"" said the Kid gently, ""I reckon not. I never saw it before.  I was just looking at it. Not thinking of selling it, are you?""<br><br>    ""Not this trip,"" said the captain. ""I'll send it to you C.O.D. when I  get back to Buenas Tierras. Here comes that capstanfooted lubber with  the chewin'. I ought to've weighed anchor an hour ago.""<br><br>    ""Is that your ship out there?"" asked the Kid.<br><br>    ""Why, yes,"" answered the captain, ""if you want to call a schooner a  ship, and I don't mind lyin'. But you better say Miller and Gonzales,  owners, and ordinary plain, Billy-be-damned old Samuel K. Boone,  skipper.""<br><br>    ""Where are you going to?"" asked the refugee.<br><br>    ""Buenas Tierras, coast of South America--I forgot what they called the  country the last time I was there. Cargo--lumber, corrugated iron, and  machetes.""<br><br>    ""What kind of a country is it?"" asked the Kid--""hot or cold?""<br><br>    ""Warmish, buddy,"" said the captain. ""But a regular Paradise Lost for  elegance of scenery and be-yooty of geography. Ye're wakened every  morning by the sweet singin' of red birds with seven purple tails, and  the sighin' of breezes in the posies and roses. And the inhabitants  never work, for they can reach out and pick steamer baskets of the  choicest hothouse fruit without gettin' out of bed. And there's no  Sunday and no ice and no rent and no troubles and no use and no  nothin'. It's a great country for a man to go to sleep with, and wait  for somethin' to turn up. The bananys and oranges and hurricanes and  pineapples that ye eat comes from there.""<br><br>    ""That sounds to me!"" said the Kid, at last betraying interest.  ""What'll the expressage be to take me out there with you?""<br><br>    ""Twenty-four dollars,"" said Captain Boone; ""grub and transportation.  Second cabin. I haven't got a first cabin.""<br><br>    ""You've got my company,"" said the Kid, pulling out a buckskin bag.<br><br>    With three hundred dollars he had gone to Laredo for his regular  ""blowout."" The duel in Valdos's had cut short his season of hilarity,  but it had left him with nearly $200 for aid in the flight that it had  made necessary.<br><br>    ""All right, buddy,"" said the captain. ""I hope your ma won't blame me  for this little childish escapade of yours."" He beckoned to one of the  boat's crew. ""Let Sanchez lift you out to the skiff so you won't get  your feet wet.""<br><br>    * * * * *<br><br>    Thacker, the United States consul at Buenas Tierras, was not yet  drunk. It was only eleven o'clock; and he never arrived at his desired  state of beatitude--a state wherein he sang ancient maudlin vaudeville  songs and pelted his screaming parrot with banana peels--until the  middle of the afternoon. So, when he looked up from his hammock at the  sound of a slight cough, and saw the Kid standing in the door of the  consulate, he was still in a condition to extend the hospitality and  courtesy due from the representative of a great nation. ""Don't disturb  yourself,"" said the Kid, easily. ""I just dropped in. They told me it  was customary to light at your camp before starting in to round up the  town. I just came in on a ship from Texas.""<br><br>    ""Glad to see you, Mr.--"" said the consul.<br><br>    The Kid laughed.<br><br>    ""Sprague Dalton,"" he said. ""It sounds funny to me to hear it. I'm  called the Llano Kid in the Rio Grande country.""<br><br>    ""I'm Thacker,"" said the consul. ""Take that cane-bottom chair. Now if  you've come to invest, you want somebody to advise you. These dingies  will cheat you out of the gold in your teeth if you don't understand  their ways. Try a cigar?""<br><br>    ""Much obliged,"" said the Kid, ""but if it wasn't for my corn shucks and  the little bag in my back pocket I couldn't live a minute."" He took  out his ""makings,"" and rolled a cigarette.<br><br>    ""They speak Spanish here,"" said the consul. ""You'll need an  interpreter. If there's anything I can do, why, I'd be delighted. If  you're buying fruit lands or looking for a concession of any sort,  you'll want somebody who knows the ropes to look out for you.""<br><br>    ""I speak Spanish,"" said the Kid, ""about nine times better than I do  English. Everybody speaks it on the range where I come from. And I'm  not in the market for anything.""<br><br>    ""You speak Spanish?"" said Thacker thoughtfully. He regarded the kid  absorbedly.<br><br>    ""You look like a Spaniard, too,"" he continued. ""And you're from Texas.  And you can't be more than twenty or twenty-one. I wonder if you've  got any nerve.""<br><br>    ""You got a deal of some kind to put through?"" asked the Texan, with  unexpected shrewdness.<br><br>    ""Are you open to a proposition?"" said Thacker.<br><br>    ""What's the use to deny it?"" said the Kid. ""I got into a little gun  frolic down in Laredo and plugged a white man. There wasn't any  Mexican handy. And I come down to your parrot-and-monkey range just  for to smell the morning-glories and marigolds. Now, do you /sabe/?""<br><br>    Thacker got up and closed the door.<br><br>    ""Let me see your hand,"" he said.<br><br>    He took the Kid's left hand, and examined the back of it closely.<br><br>    ""I can do it,"" he said excitedly. ""Your flesh is as hard as wood and  as healthy as a baby's. It will heal in a week.""<br><br>    ""If it's a fist fight you want to back me for,"" said the Kid, ""don't  put your money up yet. Make it gun work, and I'll keep you company.  But no barehanded scrapping, like ladies at a tea-party, for me.""<br><br>    ""It's easier than that,"" said Thacker. ""Just step here, will you?""<br><br>    Through the window he pointed to a two-story white-stuccoed house with  wide galleries rising amid the deep-green tropical foliage on a wooded  hill that sloped gently from the sea.<br><br>    ""In that house,"" said Thacker, ""a fine old Castilian gentleman and his  wife are yearning to gather you into their arms and fill your pockets  with money. Old Santos Urique lives there. He owns half the gold-mines  in the country.""<br><br>    ""You haven't been eating loco weed, have you?"" asked the Kid.<br><br>    ""Sit down again,"" said Thacker, ""and I'll tell you. Twelve years ago  they lost a kid. No, he didn't die--although most of 'em here do from  drinking the surface water. He was a wild little devil, even if he  wasn't but eight years old. Everybody knows about it. Some Americans  who were through here prospecting for gold had letters to Senor  Urique, and the boy was a favorite with them. They filled his head  with big stories about the States; and about a month after they left,  the kid disappeared, too. He was supposed to have stowed himself away  among the banana bunches on a fruit steamer, and gone to New Orleans.  He was seen once afterward in Texas, it was thought, but they never  heard anything more of him. Old Urique has spent thousands of dollars  having him looked for. The madam was broken up worst of all. The kid  was her life. She wears mourning yet. But they say she believes he'll  come back to her some day, and never gives up hope. On the back of the  boy's left hand was tattooed a flying eagle carrying a spear in his  claws. That's old Urique's coat of arms or something that he inherited  in Spain.""<br><br>    The Kid raised his left hand slowly and gazed at it curiously.<br><br>    ""That's it,"" said Thacker, reaching behind the official desk for his  bottle of smuggled brandy. ""You're not so slow. I can do it. What was  I consul at Sandakan for? I never knew till now. In a week I'll have  the eagle bird with the frog-sticker blended in so you'd think you  were born with it. I brought a set of the needles and ink just because  I was sure you'd drop in some day, Mr. Dalton.""<br><br>    ""Oh, hell,"" said the Kid. ""I thought I told you my name!""<br><br>    ""All right, 'Kid,' then. It won't be that long. How does Senorito  Urique sound, for a change?""<br><br>    ""I never played son any that I remember of,"" said the Kid. ""If I had  any parents to mention they went over the divide about the time I gave  my first bleat. What is the plan of your round-up?""<br><br>    Thacker leaned back against the wall and held his glass up to the  light.<br><br>    ""We've come now,"" said he, ""to the question of how far you're willing  to go in a little matter of the sort.""<br><br>    ""I told you why I came down here,"" said the Kid simply.<br><br>    ""A good answer,"" said the consul. ""But you won't have to go that far.  Here's the scheme. After I get the trademark tattooed on your hand  I'll notify old Urique. In the meantime I'll furnish you with all of  the family history I can find out, so you can be studying up points to  talk about. You've got the looks, you speak the Spanish, you know the  facts, you can tell about Texas, you've got the tattoo mark. When I  notify them that the rightful heir has returned and is waiting to know  whether he will be received and pardoned, what will happen? They'll  simply rush down here and fall on your neck, and the curtain goes down  for refreshments and a stroll in the lobby.""<br><br>    ""I'm waiting,"" said the Kid. ""I haven't had my saddle off in your camp  long, pardner, and I never met you before; but if you intend to let it  go at a parental blessing, why, I'm mistaken in my man, that's all.""<br><br>    ""Thanks,"" said the consul. ""I haven't met anybody in a long time that  keeps up with an argument as well as you do. The rest of it is simple.  If they take you in only for a while it's long enough. Don't give 'em  time to hunt up the strawberry mark on your left shoulder. Old Urique  keeps anywhere from $50,000 to $100,000 in his house all the time in a  little safe that you could open with a shoe buttoner. Get it. My skill  as a tattooer is worth half the boddle. We go halves and catch a tramp  steamer for Rio Janeiro. Let the United States go to pieces if it  can't get along without my services. /Que dice, senor/?""<br><br>    ""It sounds to me!"" said the Kid, nodding his head. ""I'm out for the  dust.""<br><br>    ""All right, then,"" said Thacker. ""You'll have to keep close until we  get the bird on you. You can live in the back room here. I do my own  cooking, and I'll make you as comfortable as a parsimonious Government  will allow me.""<br><br>    Thacker had set the time at a week, but it was two weeks before the  design that he patiently tattooed upon the Kid's hand was to his  notion. And then Thacker called a /muchacho/, and dispatched this note  to the intended victim:<br><br>    El Senor Don Santos Urique,  La Casa Blanca,<br><br>    My Dear Sir:<br><br>    I beg permission to inform you that there is in my house as a  temporary guest a young man who arrived in Buenas Tierras from the  United States some days ago. Without wishing to excite any hopes  that may not be realized, I think there is a possibility of his  being your long-absent son. It might be well for you to call and  see him. If he is, it is my opinion that his intention was to  return to his home, but upon arriving here, his courage failed him  from doubts as to how he would be received. Your true servant,<br><br>    Thompson Thacker.<br><br>      Half an hour afterward--quick time for Buenas Tierras--Senor Urique's  ancient landau drove to the consul's door, with the barefooted  coachman beating and shouting at the team of fat, awkward horses.<br><br>    A tall man with a white moustache alighted, and assisted to the ground  a lady who was dressed and veiled in unrelieved black.<br><br>    The two hastened inside, and were met by Thacker with his best  diplomatic bow. By his desk stood a slender young man with clear-cut,  sun-browned features and smoothly brushed black hair.<br><br>    Senora Urique threw back her black veil with a quick gesture. She was  past middle age, and her hair was beginning to silver, but her full,  proud figure and clear olive skin retained traces of the beauty  peculiar to the Basque province. But, once you had seen her eyes, and  comprehended the great sadness that was revealed in their deep shadows  and hopeless expression, you saw that the woman lived only in some  memory.<br><br>    She bent upon the young man a long look of the most agonized  questioning. Then her great black eyes turned, and her gaze rested  upon his left hand. And then with a sob, not loud, but seeming to  shake the room, she cried ""/Hijo mio/!"" and caught the Llano Kid to  her heart.<br><br>    A month afterward the Kid came to the consulate in response to a  message sent by Thacker.<br><br>    He looked the young Spanish /caballero/. His clothes were imported,  and the wiles of the jewellers had not been spent upon him in vain. A  more than respectable diamond shone on his finger as he rolled a shuck  cigarette.<br><br>    ""What's doing?"" asked Thacker.<br><br>    ""Nothing much,"" said the Kid calmly. ""I eat my first iguana steak  to-day. They're them big lizards, you /sabe/? I reckon, though, that  frijoles and side bacon would do me about as well. Do you care for  iguanas, Thacker?""<br><br>    ""No, nor for some other kinds of reptiles,"" said Thacker.<br><br>    It was three in the afternoon, and in another hour he would be in his  state of beatitude.<br><br>    ""It's time you were making good, sonny,"" he went on, with an ugly look  on his reddened face. ""You're not playing up to me square. You've been  the prodigal son for four weeks now, and you could have had veal for  every meal on a gold dish if you'd wanted it. Now, Mr. Kid, do you  think it's right to leave me out so long on a husk diet? What's the  trouble? Don't you get your filial eyes on anything that looks like  cash in the Casa Blanca? Don't tell me you don't. Everybody knows  where old Urique keeps his stuff. It's U.S. currency, too; he don't  accept anything else. What's doing? Don't say 'nothing' this time.""<br><br>    ""Why, sure,"" said the Kid, admiring his diamond, ""there's plenty of  money up there. I'm no judge of collateral in bunches, but I will  undertake for to say that I've seen the rise of $50,000 at a time in  that tin grub box that my adopted father calls his safe. And he lets  me carry the key sometimes just to show me that he knows I'm the real  Francisco that strayed from the herd a long time ago.""<br><br>    ""Well, what are you waiting for?"" asked Thacker, angrily. ""Don't you  forget that I can upset your apple-cart any day I want to. If old  Urique knew you were an imposter, what sort of things would happen to  you? Oh, you don't know this country, Mr. Texas Kid. The laws here  have got mustard spread between 'em. These people here'd stretch you  out like a frog that had been stepped on, and give you about fifty  sticks at every corner of the plaza. And they'd wear every stick out,  too. What was left of you they'd feed to alligators.""<br><br>    ""I might just as well tell you now, pardner,"" said the Kid, sliding  down low on his steamer chair, ""that things are going to stay just as  they are. They're about right now.""<br><br>    ""What do you mean?"" asked Thacker, rattling the bottom of his glass on  his desk.<br><br>    ""The scheme's off,"" said the Kid. ""And whenever you have the pleasure  of speaking to me address me as Don Francisco Urique. I'll guarantee  I'll answer to it. We'll let Colonel Urique keep his money. His little  tin safe is as good as the time-locker in the First National Bank of  Laredo as far as you and me are concerned.""<br><br>    ""You're going to throw me down, then, are you?"" said the consul.<br><br>    ""Sure,"" said the Kid cheerfully. ""Throw you down. That's it. And now  I'll tell you why. The first night I was up at the colonel's house  they introduced me to a bedroom. No blankets on the floor--a real  room, with a bed and things in it. And before I was asleep, in comes  this artificial mother and tucks in the covers. 'Panchito,' she says,  'my little lost one, God has brought you back to me. I bless His name  forever.' It was that, or some truck like that, she said. And down  comes a drop or two of rain and hits me on the nose. And all that  stuck by me, Mr. Thacker. And it's been that way ever since. And it's  got to stay that way. Don't you think that it's for what's in it for  me, either, that I say so. If you have any such ideas, keep 'em to  yourself. I haven't had much truck with women in my life, and no  mothers to speak of, but here's a lady that we've got to keep fooled.  Once she stood it; twice she won't. I'm a low-down wolf, and the devil  may have sent me on this trail instead of God, but I'll travel it to  the end. And now, don't forget that I'm Don Francisco Urique whenever  you happen to mention my name.""<br><br>    ""I'll expose you to-day, you--you double-dyed traitor,"" stammered  Thacker.<br><br>    The Kid arose and, without violence, took Thacker by the throat with a  hand of steel, and shoved him slowly into a corner. Then he drew from  under his left arm his pearl-handled .45 and poked the cold muzzle of  it against the consul's mouth.<br><br>    ""I told you why I come here,"" he said, with his old freezing smile.  ""If I leave here, you'll be the reason. Never forget it, pardner. Now,  what is my name?""<br><br>    ""Er--Don Francisco Urique,"" gasped Thacker.<br><br>    From outside came a sound of wheels, and the shouting of some one, and  the sharp thwacks of a wooden whipstock upon the backs of fat horses.<br><br>    The Kid put up his gun, and walked toward the door. But he turned  again and came back to the trembling Thacker, and held up his left  hand with its back toward the consul.<br><br>    ""There's one more reason,"" he said slowly, ""why things have got to  stand as they are. The fellow I killed in Laredo had one of them same  pictures on his left hand.""<br><br>    Outside, the ancient landau of Don Santos Urique rattled to the door.  The coachman ceased his bellowing. Senora Urique, in a voluminous gay  gown of white lace and flying ribbons, leaned forward with a happy  look in her great soft eyes.<br><br>    ""Are you within, dear son?"" she called, in the rippling Castilian.<br><br>    ""Madre mia, yo vengo [mother, I come],"" answered the young Don  Francisco Urique.                             <br><br>"
73,After Twenty Years,"The policeman on the beat moved up the avenue impressively. The  impressiveness was habitual and not for show, for spectators were  few. The time was barely 10 o'clock at night, but chilly gusts of  wind with a taste of rain in them had well nigh depeopled the  streets.<br><br>    Trying doors as he went, twirling his club with many intricate and  artful movements, turning now and then to cast his watchful eye adown  the pacific thoroughfare, the officer, with his stalwart form and  slight swagger, made a fine picture of a guardian of the peace. The  vicinity was one that kept early hours. Now and then you might see  the lights of a cigar store or of an all-night lunch counter; but the  majority of the doors belonged to business places that had long since  been closed.<br><br>    When about midway of a certain block the policeman suddenly slowed  his walk. In the doorway of a darkened hardware store a man leaned,  with an unlighted cigar in his mouth. As the policeman walked up to  him the man spoke up quickly.<br><br>    ""It's all right, officer,"" he said, reassuringly. ""I'm just waiting  for a friend. It's an appointment made twenty years ago. Sounds a  little funny to you, doesn't it? Well, I'll explain if you'd like to  make certain it's all straight. About that long ago there used to be  a restaurant where this store stands--'Big Joe' Brady's restaurant.""<br><br>    ""Until five years ago,"" said the policeman. ""It was torn down then.""<br><br>    The man in the doorway struck a match and lit his cigar. The light  showed a pale, square-jawed face with keen eyes, and a little white  scar near his right eyebrow. His scarfpin was a large diamond, oddly  set.<br><br>    ""Twenty years ago to-night,"" said the man, ""I dined here at 'Big Joe'  Brady's with Jimmy Wells, my best chum, and the finest chap in the  world. He and I were raised here in New York, just like two  brothers, together. I was eighteen and Jimmy was twenty. The next  morning I was to start for the West to make my fortune. You couldn't  have dragged Jimmy out of New York; he thought it was the only place  on earth. Well, we agreed that night that we would meet here again  exactly twenty years from that date and time, no matter what our  conditions might be or from what distance we might have to come. We  figured that in twenty years each of us ought to have our destiny  worked out and our fortunes made, whatever they were going to be.""<br><br>    ""It sounds pretty interesting,"" said the policeman. ""Rather a long  time between meets, though, it seems to me. Haven't you heard from  your friend since you left?""<br><br>    ""Well, yes, for a time we corresponded,"" said the other. ""But after  a year or two we lost track of each other. You see, the West is a  pretty big proposition, and I kept hustling around over it pretty  lively. But I know Jimmy will meet me here if he's alive, for he  always was the truest, stanchest old chap in the world. He'll never  forget. I came a thousand miles to stand in this door to-night, and  it's worth it if my old partner turns up.""<br><br>    The waiting man pulled out a handsome watch, the lids of it set with  small diamonds.<br><br>    ""Three minutes to ten,"" he announced. ""It was exactly ten o'clock  when we parted here at the restaurant door.""<br><br>    ""Did pretty well out West, didn't you?"" asked the policeman.<br><br>    ""You bet! I hope Jimmy has done half as well. He was a kind of  plodder, though, good fellow as he was. I've had to compete with  some of the sharpest wits going to get my pile. A man gets in a  groove in New York. It takes the West to put a razor-edge on him.""<br><br>    The policeman twirled his club and took a step or two.<br><br>    ""I'll be on my way. Hope your friend comes around all right. Going  to call time on him sharp?""<br><br>    ""I should say not!"" said the other. ""I'll give him half an hour at  least. If Jimmy is alive on earth he'll be here by that time. So  long, officer.""<br><br>    ""Good-night, sir,"" said the policeman, passing on along his beat,  trying doors as he went.<br><br>    There was now a fine, cold drizzle falling, and the wind had risen  from its uncertain puffs into a steady blow. The few foot passengers  astir in that quarter hurried dismally and silently along with coat  collars turned high and pocketed hands. And in the door of the  hardware store the man who had come a thousand miles to fill an  appointment, uncertain almost to absurdity, with the friend of his  youth, smoked his cigar and waited.<br><br>    About twenty minutes he waited, and then a tall man in a long  overcoat, with collar turned up to his ears, hurried across from the  opposite side of the street. He went directly to the waiting man.<br><br>    ""Is that you, Bob?"" he asked, doubtfully.<br><br>    ""Is that you, Jimmy Wells?"" cried the man in the door.<br><br>    ""Bless my heart!"" exclaimed the new arrival, grasping both the  other's hands with his own. ""It's Bob, sure as fate. I was certain  I'd find you here if you were still in existence. Well, well, well!  --twenty years is a long time. The old gone, Bob; I wish it had  lasted, so we could have had another dinner there. How has the West  treated you, old man?""<br><br>    ""Bully; it has given me everything I asked it for. You've changed  lots, Jimmy. I never thought you were so tall by two or three  inches.""<br><br>    ""Oh, I grew a bit after I was twenty.""<br><br>    ""Doing well in New York, Jimmy?""<br><br>    ""Moderately. I have a position in one of the city departments. Come  on, Bob; we'll go around to a place I know of, and have a good long  talk about old times.""<br><br>    The two men started up the street, arm in arm. The man from the  West, his egotism enlarged by success, was beginning to outline the  history of his career. The other, submerged in his overcoat,  listened with interest.<br><br>    At the corner stood a drug store, brilliant with electric lights.  When they came into this glare each of them turned simultaneously to  gaze upon the other's face.<br><br>    The man from the West stopped suddenly and released his arm.<br><br>    ""You're not Jimmy Wells,"" he snapped. ""Twenty years is a long time,  but not long enough to change a man's nose from a Roman to a pug.""<br><br>    ""It sometimes changes a good man into a bad one, said the tall man.  ""You've been under arrest for ten minutes, 'Silky' Bob. Chicago  thinks you may have dropped over our way and wires us she wants to  have a chat with you. Going quietly, are you? That's sensible.  Now, before we go on to the station here's a note I was asked to hand  you. You may read it here at the window. It's from Patrolman  Wells.""<br><br>    The man from the West unfolded the little piece of paper handed him.  His hand was steady when he began to read, but it trembled a little  by the time he had finished. The note was rather short.<br><br>    ~""Bob: I was at the appointed place on time. When you struck the  match to light your cigar I saw it was the face of the man wanted in  Chicago. Somehow I couldn't do it myself, so I went around and got  a plain clothes man to do the job. JIMMY.""                             <br><br>"
74,A Newspaper Story,"AT 8 A. M. it lay on Giuseppi's news-stand, still damp from the presses. Giuseppi, with the cunning of his ilk, philandered on the opposite comer, leaving his patrons to help themselves, no doubt on a theory related to the hypothesis of the watched pot.<br><br>    This particular newspaper was, according to its custom and design, an educator, a guide, a monitor, a champion and a household counsellor and vade mecum.<br><br>    From its many excellencies might be selected three editorials. One was in simple and chaste but illuminat- ing language directed to parents and teachers, depreca- ting corporal punishment for children.<br><br>    Another was an accusive and significant warning addressed to a notorious labour leader who was on the point of instigating his clients to a troublesome strike.<br><br>    The third was an eloquent demand that the police force be sustained and aided in everything that tended to increase its efficiency as public guardians and servants.<br><br>    Besides these more important chidings and requisitions upon the store of good citizenship was a wise prescription or form of procedure laid out by the editor of the heart- to-heart column in the specific case of a young man who had complained of the obduracy of his lady love, teaching him how he might win her.<br><br>    Again, there was, on the beauty page, a complete answer to a young lady inquirer who desired admonition toward the securing of bright eyes, rosy cheeks and a beautiful countenance.<br><br>    One other item requiring special cognizance was a brief ""personal,"" running thus:<br><br>    DEAR JACK: -- Forgive me. You were right. Meet me comer Madison and -th at 8.30 this morning. We leave at noon.<br><br>    PENITENT.<br><br>    At 8 o'clock a young man with a haggard look and the feverish gleam of unrest in his eye dropped a penny and picked up the top paper as he passed Giuseppi's stand. A sleepless night had left him a late riser. There was an office to be reached by nine, and a shave and a hasty cup of coffee to be crowded into the interval.<br><br>    He visited his barber shop and then hurried on his way. He pocketed his paper, meditating a belated perusal of it at the luncheon hour. At the next corner it fell from his pocket, carrying with it his pair of new gloves. Three blocks he walked, missed the gloves and turned back fuming.<br><br>    Just on the half-hour he reached the corner where lay the gloves and the paper. But he strangely ignored that which he had come to seek. He was holding two little hands as tightly as ever he could and looking into two penitent brown eyes, while joy rioted in his heart.<br><br>    ""Dear Jack,"" she said, ""I knew you would be here on time.""<br><br>    ""I wonder what she means by that,"" he was saying to himself; ""but it's all right, it's all right.""<br><br>    A big wind puffed out of the west, picked up the paper from the sidewalk, opened it out and sent it flying and whirling down a side street. Up that street was driving a skittish bay to a spider-wheel buggy, the young man who had written to the heart-to-heart editor for a recipe that he might win her for whom he sighed.<br><br>    The wind, with a prankish flurry, flapped the flying newspaper against the face of the skittish bay. There was a lengthened streak of bay mingled with the red of running gear that stretched itself out for four blocks. Then a water-hydrant played its part in the cosmogony, the buggy became matchwood as foreordained, and the driver rested very quietly where he had been flung on the asphalt in front of a certain brownstone mansion.<br><br>    They came out and had him inside very promptly. And there was one who made herself a pillow for his head, and cared for no curious eyes, bending over and saying, ""Oh, it was you; it was you all the time, Bobby! Couldn't you see it? And if you die, why, so must I, and -- ""<br><br>    But in all this wind we must hurry to keep in touch with our paper.<br><br>    Policeman O'Brine arrested it as a character dangerous to traffic. Straightening its dishevelled leaves with his big, slow fingers, he stood a few feet from the family entrance of the Shandon Bells Caf. One headline he spelled out ponderously: ""The Papers to the Front in a Move to Help the Police.""<br><br>    But, whisht! The voice of Danny, the head bartender, through the crack of the door: ""Here's a nip for ye, Mike, ould man.""<br><br>    Behind the widespread, amicable columns of the press Policeman O'Brine receives swiftly his nip of the real stuff. He moves away, stalwart, refreshed, fortified, to his duties. Might not the editor man view with pride the early, the spiritual, the literal fruit that had blessed his labours.<br><br>    Policeman O'Brine folded the paper and poked it playfully under the arm of a small boy that was passing. That boy was named Johnny, and he took the paper home with him. His sister was named Gladys, and she had written to the beauty editor of the paper asking for the practicable touchstone of beauty. That was weeks ago, and she had ceased to look for an answer. Gladys was a pale girl, with dull eyes and a discontented expression. She was dressing to go up to the avenue to get some braid. Beneath her skirt she pinned two leaves of the paper Johnny had brought. When she walked the rustling sound was an exact imitation of the real thing.<br><br>    On the street she met the Brown girl from the flat below and stopped to talk. The Brown girl turned green. Only silk at $5 a yard could make the sound that she heard when Gladys moved. The Brown girl, consumed by jealousy, said something spiteful and went her way, with pinched lips.<br><br>    Gladys proceeded toward the avenue. Her eyes now sparkled like jagerfonteins. A rosy bloom visited her cheeks; a triumphant, subtle, vivifying, smile transfigured her face. She was beautiful. Could the beauty editor have seen her then! There was something in her answer in the paper, I believe, about cultivating kind feelings toward others in order to make plain features attractive.<br><br>    The labour leader against whom the paper's solemn and weighty editorial injunction was laid was the father of Gladys and Johnny. He picked up the remains of the journal from which Gladys had ravished a cosmetic of silken sounds. The editorial did not come under his eye, but instead it was greeted by one of those ingenious and specious puzzle problems that enthrall alike the simpleton and the sage.<br><br>    The labour leader tore off half of the page, provided himself with table, pencil and paper and glued himself to his puzzle.<br><br>    Three hours later, after waiting vainly for him at the appointed place, other more conservative leaders declared and ruled in favour of arbitration, and the strike with its attendant dangers was averted. Subsequent editions of the paper referred, in coloured inks, to the clarion tone of its successful denunciation of the labour leader's intended designs.<br><br>    The remaining leaves of the active journal also went loyally to the proving of its potency.<br><br>    When Johnny returned from school he sought a secluded spot and removed the missing columns from the inside of his clothing, where they had been artfully distributed so as to successfully defend such areas as are generally attacked during scholastic castigations. Johnny attended a private school and had had trouble with his teacher. As has been said, there was an excellent editorial against corporal punishment in that morning's issue, and no doubt it had its effect.<br><br>    After this can any one doubt the power of the press?                             <br><br>"
75,A Retrieved Reformation,"  A guard came to the prison shoe-shop, where Jimmy Valentine was  assiduously stitching uppers, and escorted him to the front office.  There the warden handed Jimmy his pardon, which had been signed that  morning by the governor. Jimmy took it in a tired kind of way. He had  served nearly ten months of a four year sentence. He had expected to  stay only about three months, at the longest. When a man with as many  friends on the outside as Jimmy Valentine had is received in the  ""stir"" it is hardly worth while to cut his hair.  <br><br>  ""Now, Valentine,"" said the warden, ""you'll go out in the morning.  Brace up, and make a man of yourself. You're not a bad fellow at  heart. Stop cracking safes, and live straight.""  <br><br>  ""Me?"" said Jimmy, in surprise. ""Why, I never cracked a safe in my  life.""  <br><br>  ""Oh, no,"" laughed the warden. ""Of course not. Let's see, now. How was  it you happened to get sent up on that Springfield job? Was it because  you wouldn't prove an alibi for fear of compromising somebody in  extremely high-toned society? Or was it simply a case of a mean old  jury that had it in for you? It's always one or the other with you  innocent victims.""  <br><br>  ""Me?"" said Jimmy, still blankly virtuous. ""Why, warden, I never was in  Springfield in my life!""  <br><br>  ""Take him back, Cronin!"" said the warden, ""and fix him up with  outgoing clothes. Unlock him at seven in the morning, and let him come  to the bull-pen. Better think over my advice, Valentine.""  <br><br>  At a quarter past seven on the next morning Jimmy stood in the  warden's outer office. He had on a suit of the villainously fitting,  ready-made clothes and a pair of the stiff, squeaky shoes that the  state furnishes to its discharged compulsory guests.  <br><br>  The clerk handed him a railroad ticket and the five-dollar bill with  which the law expected him to rehabilitate himself into good  citizenship and prosperity. The warden gave him a cigar, and shook  hands. Valentine, 9762, was chronicled on the books, ""Pardoned by  Governor,"" and Mr. James Valentine walked out into the sunshine.  <br><br>  Disregarding the song of the birds, the waving green trees, and the  smell of the flowers, Jimmy headed straight for a restaurant. There he  tasted the first sweet joys of liberty in the shape of a broiled  chicken and a bottle of white wine--followed by a cigar a grade better  than the one the warden had given him. From there he proceeded  leisurely to the depot. He tossed a quarter into the hat of a blind  man sitting by the door, and boarded his train. Three hours set him  down in a little town near the state line. He went to the cafe of one  Mike Dolan and shook hands with Mike, who was alone behind the bar.  <br><br>  ""Sorry we couldn't make it sooner, Jimmy, me boy,"" said Mike. ""But we  had that protest from Springfield to buck against, and the governor  nearly balked. Feeling all right?""  <br><br>  ""Fine,"" said Jimmy. ""Got my key?""  <br><br>  He got his key and went upstairs, unlocking the door of a room at the  rear. Everything was just as he had left it. There on the floor was  still Ben Price's collar-button that had been torn from that eminent  detective's shirt-band when they had overpowered Jimmy to arrest him.  <br><br>  Pulling out from the wall a folding-bed, Jimmy slid back a panel in  the wall and dragged out a dust-covered suit-case. He opened this and  gazed fondly at the finest set of burglar's tools in the East. It was  a complete set, made of specially tempered steel, the latest designs  in drills, punches, braces and bits, jimmies, clamps, and augers, with  two or three novelties, invented by Jimmy himself, in which he took  pride. Over nine hundred dollars they had cost him to have made at  ----, a place where they make such things for the profession.  <br><br>  In half an hour Jimmy went down stairs and through the cafe. He was  now dressed in tasteful and well-fitting clothes, and carried his  dusted and cleaned suit-case in his hand.   <br><br>  ""Got anything on?"" asked Mike Dolan, genially.  <br><br>  ""Me?"" said Jimmy, in a puzzled tone. ""I don't understand. I'm  representing the New York Amalgamated Short Snap Biscuit Cracker and  Frazzled Wheat Company.""  <br><br>  This statement delighted Mike to such an extent that Jimmy had to take  a seltzer-and-milk on the spot. He never touched ""hard"" drinks.  <br><br>  A week after the release of Valentine, 9762, there was a neat job of  safe-burglary done in Richmond, Indiana, with no clue to the author. A  scant eight hundred dollars was all that was secured. Two weeks after  that a patented, improved, burglar-proof safe in Logansport was opened  like a cheese to the tune of fifteen hundred dollars, currency;  securities and silver untouched. That began to interest the rogue-  catchers. Then an old-fashioned bank-safe in Jefferson City became  active and threw out of its crater an eruption of bank-notes amounting  to five thousand dollars. The losses were now high enough to bring the  matter up into Ben Price's class of work. By comparing notes, a  remarkable similarity in the methods of the burglaries was noticed.  Ben Price investigated the scenes of the robberies, and was heard to  remark:  <br><br>  ""That's Dandy Jim Valentine's autograph. He's resumed business. Look  at that combination knob--jerked out as easy as pulling up a radish in  wet weather. He's got the only clamps that can do it. And look how  clean those tumblers were punched out! Jimmy never has to drill but  one hole. Yes, I guess I want Mr. Valentine. He'll do his bit next  time without any short-time or clemency foolishness.""  <br><br>  Ben Price knew Jimmy's habits. He had learned them while working on  the Springfield case. Long jumps, quick get-aways, no confederates,  and a taste for good society--these ways had helped Mr. Valentine to  become noted as a successful dodger of retribution. It was given out  that Ben Price had taken up the trail of the elusive cracksman, and  other people with burglar-proof safes felt more at ease.  <br><br>  One afternoon Jimmy Valentine and his suit-case climbed out of the  mail-hack in Elmore, a little town five miles off the railroad down in  the black-jack country of Arkansas. Jimmy, looking like an athletic  young senior just home from college, went down the board side-walk  toward the hotel.  <br><br>  A young lady crossed the street, passed him at the corner and entered  a door over which was the sign, ""The Elmore Bank."" Jimmy Valentine  looked into her eyes, forgot what he was, and became another man. She  lowered her eyes and coloured slightly. Young men of Jimmy's style and  looks were scarce in Elmore.  <br><br>  Jimmy collared a boy that was loafing on the steps of the bank as if  he were one of the stockholders, and began to ask him questions about  the town, feeding him dimes at intervals. By and by the young lady  came out, looking royally unconscious of the young man with the suit-  case, and went her way.  <br><br>  ""Isn' that young lady Polly Simpson?"" asked Jimmy, with specious  guile.  <br><br>  ""Naw,"" said the boy. ""She's Annabel Adams. Her pa owns this bank.  Why'd you come to Elmore for? Is that a gold watch-chain? I'm going to  get a bulldog. Got any more dimes?""  <br><br>  Jimmy went to the Planters' Hotel, registered as Ralph D. Spencer, and  engaged a room. He leaned on the desk and declared his platform to the  clerk. He said he had come to Elmore to look for a location to go into  business. How was the shoe business, now, in the town? He had thought  of the shoe business. Was there an opening?  <br><br>  The clerk was impressed by the clothes and manner of Jimmy. He,  himself, was something of a pattern of fashion to the thinly gilded  youth of Elmore, but he now perceived his shortcomings. While trying  to figure out Jimmy's manner of tying his four-in-hand he cordially  gave information.  <br><br>  Yes, there ought to be a good opening in the shoe line. There wasn't  an exclusive shoe-store in the place. The dry-goods and general stores  handled them. Business in all lines was fairly good. Hoped Mr. Spencer  would decide to locate in Elmore. He would find it a pleasant town to  live in, and the people very sociable.  <br><br>  Mr. Spencer thought he would stop over in the town a few days and look  over the situation. No, the clerk needn't call the boy. He would carry  up his suit-case, himself; it was rather heavy.  <br><br>  Mr. Ralph Spencer, the phoenix that arose from Jimmy Valentine's ashes  --ashes left by the flame of a sudden and alterative attack of love--  remained in Elmore, and prospered. He opened a shoe-store and secured  a good run of trade.  <br><br>  Socially he was also a success, and made many friends. And he  accomplished the wish of his heart. He met Miss Annabel Adams, and  became more and more captivated by her charms.  <br><br>  At the end of a year the situation of Mr. Ralph Spencer was this: he  had won the respect of the community, his shoe-store was flourishing,  and he and Annabel were engaged to be married in two weeks. Mr. Adams,  the typical, plodding, country banker, approved of Spencer. Annabel's  pride in him almost equalled her affection. He was as much at home in  the family of Mr. Adams and that of Annabel's married sister as if he  were already a member.  <br><br>  One day Jimmy sat down in his room and wrote this letter, which he  mailed to the safe address of one of his old friends in St. Louis:  <br><br>  Dear Old Pal:  <br><br>  I want you to be at Sullivan's place, in Little Rock, next  Wednesday night, at nine o'clock. I want you to wind up some  little matters for me. And, also, I want to make you a present of  my kit of tools. I know you'll be glad to get them--you couldn't  duplicate the lot for a thousand dollars. Say, Billy, I've quit  the old business--a year ago. I've got a nice store. I'm making an  honest living, and I'm going to marry the finest girl on earth two  weeks from now. It's the only life, Billy--the straight one. I  wouldn't touch a dollar of another man's money now for a million.  After I get married I'm going to sell out and go West, where there  won't be so much danger of having old scores brought up against  me. I tell you, Billy, she's an angel. She believes in me; and I  wouldn't do another crooked thing for the whole world. Be sure to be  at Sully's, for I must see you. I'll bring along the tools with me.  <br><br>  Your old friend,  <br><br>  Jimmy.  <br><br>  On the Monday night after Jimmy wrote this letter, Ben Price jogged  unobtrusively into Elmore in a livery buggy. He lounged about town in  his quiet way until he found out what he wanted to know. From the  drug-store across the street from Spencer's shoe-store he got a good  look at Ralph D. Spencer.  <br><br>  ""Going to marry the banker's daughter are you, Jimmy?"" said Ben to  himself, softly. ""Well, I don't know!""  <br><br>  The next morning Jimmy took breakfast at the Adamses. He was going to  Little Rock that day to order his wedding-suit and buy something nice  for Annabel. That would be the first time he had left town since he  came to Elmore. It had been more than a year now since those last  professional ""jobs,"" and he thought he could safely venture out.  <br><br>  After breakfast quite a family party went downtown together--Mr.  Adams, Annabel, Jimmy, and Annabel's married sister with her two  little girls, aged five and nine. They came by the hotel where Jimmy  still boarded, and he ran up to his room and brought along his suit-  case. Then they went on to the bank. There stood Jimmy's horse and  buggy and Dolph Gibson, who was going to drive him over to the  railroad station.  <br><br>  All went inside the high, carved oak railings into the banking-room--  Jimmy included, for Mr. Adams's future son-in-law was welcome  anywhere. The clerks were pleased to be greeted by the good-looking,  agreeable young man who was going to marry Miss Annabel. Jimmy set his  suit-case down. Annabel, whose heart was bubbling with happiness and  lively youth, put on Jimmy's hat, and picked up the suit-case.  ""Wouldn't I make a nice drummer?"" said Annabel. ""My! Ralph, how heavy  it is? Feels like it was full of gold bricks.""  <br><br>  ""Lot of nickel-plated shoe-horns in there,"" said Jimmy, coolly, ""that  I'm going to return. Thought I'd save express charges by taking them  up. I'm getting awfully economical.""  <br><br>  The Elmore Bank had just put in a new safe and vault. Mr. Adams was  very proud of it, and insisted on an inspection by every one. The  vault was a small one, but it had a new, patented door. It fastened  with three solid steel bolts thrown simultaneously with a single  handle, and had a time-lock. Mr. Adams beamingly explained its  workings to Mr. Spencer, who showed a courteous but not too  intelligent interest. The two children, May and Agatha, were delighted  by the shining metal and funny clock and knobs.  <br><br>  While they were thus engaged Ben Price sauntered in and leaned on his  elbow, looking casually inside between the railings. He told the  teller that he didn't want anything; he was just waiting for a man he  knew.  <br><br>  Suddenly there was a scream or two from the women, and a commotion.  Unperceived by the elders, May, the nine-year-old girl, in a spirit of  play, had shut Agatha in the vault. She had then shot the bolts and  turned the knob of the combination as she had seen Mr. Adams do.  <br><br>  The old banker sprang to the handle and tugged at it for a moment.  ""The door can't be opened,"" he groaned. ""The clock hasn't been wound  nor the combination set.""  <br><br>  Agatha's mother screamed again, hysterically.  <br><br>  ""Hush!"" said Mr. Adams, raising his trembling hand. ""All be quite for  a moment. Agatha!"" he called as loudly as he could. ""Listen to me.""  During the following silence they could just hear the faint sound of  the child wildly shrieking in the dark vault in a panic of terror.  <br><br>  ""My precious darling!"" wailed the mother. ""She will die of fright!  Open the door! Oh, break it open! Can't you men do something?""  <br><br>  ""There isn't a man nearer than Little Rock who can open that door,""  said Mr. Adams, in a shaky voice. ""My God! Spencer, what shall we do?  That child--she can't stand it long in there. There isn't enough air,  and, besides, she'll go into convulsions from fright.""  <br><br>  Agatha's mother, frantic now, beat the door of the vault with her  hands. Somebody wildly suggested dynamite. Annabel turned to Jimmy,  her large eyes full of anguish, but not yet despairing. To a woman  nothing seems quite impossible to the powers of the man she worships.  <br><br>  ""Can't you do something, Ralph--/try/, won't you?""  <br><br>  He looked at her with a queer, soft smile on his lips and in his keen  eyes.  <br><br>  ""Annabel,"" he said, ""give me that rose you are wearing, will you?""  <br><br>  Hardly believing that she heard him aright, she unpinned the bud from  the bosom of her dress, and placed it in his hand. Jimmy stuffed it  into his vest-pocket, threw off his coat and pulled up his shirt-  sleeves. With that act Ralph D. Spencer passed away and Jimmy  Valentine took his place.  <br><br>  ""Get away from the door, all of you,"" he commanded, shortly.  <br><br>  He set his suit-case on the table, and opened it out flat. From that  time on he seemed to be unconscious of the presence of any one else.  He laid out the shining, queer implements swiftly and orderly,  whistling softly to himself as he always did when at work. In a deep  silence and immovable, the others watched him as if under a spell.  <br><br>  In a minute Jimmy's pet drill was biting smoothly into the steel door.  In ten minutes--breaking his own burglarious record--he threw back the  bolts and opened the door.  <br><br>  Agatha, almost collapsed, but safe, was gathered into her mother's  arms.  <br><br>  Jimmy Valentine put on his coat, and walked outside the railings  towards the front door. As he went he thought he heard a far-away  voice that he once knew call ""Ralph!"" But he never hesitated.  <br><br>  At the door a big man stood somewhat in his way.  <br><br>  ""Hello, Ben!"" said Jimmy, still with his strange smile. ""Got around at  last, have you? Well, let's go. I don't know that it makes much  difference, now.""  <br><br>  And then Ben Price acted rather strangely.  <br><br>  ""Guess you're mistaken, Mr. Spencer,"" he said. ""Don't believe I  recognize you. Your buggy's waiting for you, ain't it?""                               <br><br>"
76,Babes In The Jungle,"  Montague Silver, the finest street man and art grafter in the West, says to me once in Little Rock: ""If you ever lose your mind, Billy, and get too old to do honest swindling among grown men, go to New York. In the West a sucker is born every minute; but in New York they appear in chunks of roe - you can't count 'em!""  <br><br>  Two years afterward I found that I couldn't remember the names of the Russian admirals, and I noticed some gray hairs over my left ear; so I knew the time had arrived for me to take Silver's advice.  <br><br>  I struck New York about noon one day, and took a walk up Broadway. And I run against Silver himself, all encompassed up in a spacious kind of haberdashery, leaning against a hotel and rubbing the half-moons on his nails with a silk handkerchief.  <br><br>  ""Paresis or superannuated?"" I asks him.  <br><br>  ""Hello, Billy,"" says Silver; ""I'm glad to see you. Yes, it seemed to me that the West was accumulating a little too much wiseness. I've been saving New York for dessert. I know it's a low-down trick to take things from these people. They only know this and that and pass to and fro and think ever and anon. I'd hate for my mother to know I was skinning these weak-minded ones. She raised me better.""  <br><br>  ""Is there a crush already in the waiting rooms of the old doctor that does skin grafting?"" I asks.  <br><br>  ""Well, no,"" says Silver; ""you needn't back Epidermis to win today. I've only been here a month. But I'm ready to begin; and the members of Willie Manhattan's Sunday School class, each of whom has volunteered to contribute a portion of cuticle toward this rehabilitation, may as well send their photos to the Evening Daily.  <br><br>  ""I've been studying the town,"" says Silver, ""and reading the papers every day, and I know it as well as the cat in the City Hall knows an O'Sullivan. People here lie down on the floor and scream and kick when you are the least bit slow about taking money from them. Come up in my room and I'll tell you. We'll work the town together, Billy, for the sake of old times.""  <br><br>  Silver takes me up in a hotel. He has a quantity of irrelevant objects lying about.  <br><br>  ""There's more ways of getting money from these metropolitan hayseeds,"" says Silver, ""than there is of cooking rice in Charleston, S. C. They'll bite at anything. The brains of most of 'em commute. The wiser they are in intelligence the less perception of cognizance they have. Why, didin't a man the other day sell J. P. Morgan an oil portrait of Rockefeller, Jr., for Andrea del Sarto's celebrated painting of the young Saint John!  <br><br>  ""You see that bundle of printed stuff in the corner, Billy? That's gold mining stock. I started out one day to sell that, but I quit it in two hours. Why? Got arrested for blocking the street. People fought to buy it. I sold the policeman a block of it on the way to the station-house, and then I took it off the market. I don't want people to give me their money. I want some little consideration connected with the transaction to keep my pride from being hurt. I want 'em to guess the missing letter in Chic-go, or draw to a pair of nines before they pay me a cent of money.  <br><br>  ""Now there's another little scheme that worked so easy I had to quit it. You see that bottle of blue ink on the table? I tattooed an anchor on the back of my hand and went to a bank and told 'em I was Admiral Dewey's nephew. They offered to cash my draft on him for a thousand, but I didn't know my uncle's first name. It shows, though, what an easy town it is. As for burglars, they won't go in a house now unless there's a hot supper ready and a few college students to wait on 'em. They're slugging citizens all over the upper part of the city and I guess, taking the town from end to end, it's a plain case of assault and Battery.""  <br><br>  ""Monty,"" says I, when Silver had slacked, up, ""you may have Manhattan correctly discriminated in your perorative, but I doubt it. I've only been in town two hours, but it don't dawn upon me that it's ours with a cherry in it. There ain't enough rus in urbe about it to suit me. I'd be a good deal much better satisfied if the citizens had a straw or more in their hair, and run more to velveteen vests and buckeye watch charms. They don't look easy to me.""  <br><br>  ""You've got it, Billy,"" says Silver. ""All emigrants have it. New York's bigger than Little Rock or Europe, and it frightens a foreigner. You'll be all right. I tell you I feel like slapping the people here because they don't send me all their money in laundry baskets, with germicide sprinkled over it. I hate to go down on the street to get it. Who wears the diamonds in this town? Why, Winnie, the Wiretapper's wife, and Bella, the Buncosteerer's bride. New Yorkers can be worked easier than a blue rose on a tidy. The only thing that bothers me is I know I'll break the cigars in my vest pocket when I get my clothes all full of twenties.""  <br><br>  ""I hope you are right, Monty,"" says I; ""but I wish all the same I had been satisfied with a small business in Little Rock. The crop of farmers is never so short out there but what you can get a few of 'em to sign a petition for a new post office that you can discount for $200 at the county bank. The people here appear to possess instincts of self-preservation and illiberality. I fear me that we are not cultured enough to tackle this game.""  <br><br>  ""Don't worry,"" says Silver. ""I've got this Jayville-near-Tarrytown correctly estimated as sure as North River is the Hudson and East River ain't a river. Why, there are people living in four blocks of Broadway who never saw any kind of a building except a skyscraper in their lives! A good, live hustling Western man ought to get conspicuous enough here inside of three months to incur either Jerome's clemency or Lawson's displeasure.""  <br><br>  ""Hyperbole aside,"" says I, ""do you know of any immediate system of buncoing the community out of a dollar or two except by applying to the Salvation Army or having a fit on Miss Helen Gould's doorsteps?""  <br><br>  ""Dozens of 'em,"" says Silver. ""How much capital have you got, Billy?""  <br><br>  ""A thousand,"" I told him.  <br><br>  ""I've got $1,200,"" says he. ""We'll pool and do a big piece of business. There's so many ways we can make a million that I don't know how to begin.""  <br><br>  The next morning Silver meets me at the hotel and he is all sonorous and stirred with a kind of silent joy.  <br><br>  ""We're to meet J. P. Morgan this afternoon,"" says he. ""A man I know in the hotel wants to introduce us. He's a friend of his. He says he likes to meet people from the West.""  <br><br>  ""That sounds nice and plausible,"" says I. ""I'd like to know Mr. Morgan.""  <br><br>  ""It won't hurt us a bit,"" says Silver, ""to get acquainted with a few finance kings. I kind of like the social way New York has with strangers.""  <br><br>  The man Silver knew was named Klein. At three o'clock Klein brought his Wall Street friend to see us in Silver's room. ""Mr. Morgan"" looked some like his pictures, and he had a Turkish towel wrapped around his left foot, and he walked with a cane.  <br><br>  ""Mr. Silver and Mr. Pescud,"" says Klein. ""It sounds superfluous,"" says he, ""to mention the name of the greatest financial -""  <br><br>  ""Cut it out, Klein,"" says Mr. Morgan. ""I'm glad to know you gents; I take great interest in the West. Klein tells me you're from Little Rock. I think I've a railroad or two out there somewhere. If either of you guys would like to deal a hand or two of stud poker I -""  <br><br>  ""Now, Pierpont,"" cuts in Klein, ""you forget!""  <br><br>  ""Excuse me, gents!"" says Morgan; ""since I've had the gout so bad I sometimes play a social game of cards at my house. Neither of you never knew One-eyed Peters, did you, while you was around Little Rock? He lived in Seattle, New Mexico.""  <br><br>  Before we could answer, Mr. Morgan hammers on the floor with his cane and begins to walk up and down, swearing in a loud tone of voice.  <br><br>  ""They have been pounding your stocks to-day on the Street, Pierpont?"" asks Klein, smiling.  <br><br>  ""Stocks! No!"" roars Mr. Morgan. ""It's that picture I sent an agent to Europe to buy. I just thought about it. He cabled me to-day that it ain't to be found in all Italy. I'd pay $50,000 to-morrow for that picture - yes, $75,000. I give the agent a la carte in purchasing it. I cannot understand why the art galleries will allow a De Vinchy to -""  <br><br>  ""Why, Mr. Morgan,"" says klein; ""I thought you owned all of the De Vinchy paintings.""  <br><br>  ""What is the picture like, Mr. Morgan?"" asks Silver. ""It must be as big as the side of the Flatiron Building.""  <br><br>  ""I'm afraid your art education is on the bum, Mr. Silver,"" says Morgan. ""The picture is 27 inches by 42; and it is called 'Love's Idle Hour.' It represents a number of cloak models doing the two-step on the bank of a purple river. The cablegram said it might have been brought to this country. My collection will never be complete without that picture. Well, so long, gents; us financiers must keep early hours.""  <br><br>  Mr. Morgan and Klein went away together in a cab. Me and Silver talked about how simple and unsuspecting great people was; and Silver said what a shame it would be to try to rob a man like Mr. Morgan; and I said I thought it would be rather imprudent, myself. Klein proposes a stroll after dinner; and me and him and Silver walks down toward Seventh Avenue to see the sights. Klein sees a pair of cuff links that instigate his admiration in a pawnshop window, and we all go in while he buys 'em.  <br><br>  After we got back to the hotel and Klein had gone, Silver jumps at me and waves his hands.  <br><br>  ""Did you see it?"" says he. ""Did you see it, Billy?""  <br><br>  ""What?"" I asks.  <br><br>  ""Why, that picture that Morgan wants. It's hanging in that pawnshop, behind the desk. I didn't say anything because Klein was there. It's the article sure as you live. The girls are as natural as paint can make them, all measuring 36 and 25 and 42 skirts, if they had any skirts, and they're doing a buck-and-wing on the bank of a river with the blues. What did Mr. Morgan say he'd give for it? Oh, don't make me tell you. They can't know what it is in that pawnshop.""  <br><br>  When the pawnshop opened the next morning me and Silver was standing there as anxious as if we wanted to soak our Sunday suit to buy a drink. We sauntered inside, and began to look at watch-chains.  <br><br>  ""That's a violent specimen of a chromo you've got up there,"" remarked Silver, casual, to the pawnbroker. ""But I kind of enthuse over the girl with the shoulderblades and red bunting. Would an offer of $2.25 for it cause you to knock over any fragile articles of your stock in hurrying it off the nail?""  <br><br>  The pawnbroker smiles and goes on showing us plate watch-chains.  <br><br>  ""That picture,"" says he, ""was pledged a year ago by an Italian gentleman. I loaned him $500 on it. It is called 'Love's Idle Hour,' and it is by Leonardo de Vinchy. Two days ago the legal time expired, and it became an unredeemed pledge. Here is a style of chain that is worn a great deal now.""  <br><br>  At the end of half an hour me and Silver paid the pawnbroker $2,000 and walked out with the picture. Silver got into a cab with it and started for Morgan's office. I goes to the hotel and waits for him. In two hours Silver comes back.  <br><br>  ""Did you see Mr. Morgan?"" I asks. ""How much did he pay you for it?""  <br><br>  Silver sits down and fools with a tassel on the table cover.  <br><br>  ""I never exactly saw Mr. Morgan,"" he says, ""because Mr. Morgan's been in Europe for a month. But what's worrying me, Billy, is this: The department stores have all got that same picture on sale, framed, for $3.48. And they charge $3.50 for the frame alone - that's what I can't understand.""  <br><br>"
77,Blind Man's Holiday,"Alas for the man and for the artist with the shifting point of perspective! Life shall be a confusion of ways to the one; the landscape shall rise up and confound the other. Take the case of Lorison. At one time he appeared to himself to be the feeblest of fools; at another he conceived that he followed ideals so fine that the world was not yet ready to accept them. During one mood he cursed his folly; possessed by the other, he bore himself with a serene grandeur akin to greatness: in neither did he attain the perspective.<br><br>    Generations before, the name had been ""Larsen."" His race had bequeathed him its fine-strung, melancholy temperament, its saving balance of thrift and industry.<br><br>    From his point of perspective he saw himself an outcast from society, forever to be a shady skulker along the ragged edge of respectability; a denizen des trois-quartz de monde, that pathetic spheroid lying between the haut and the demi, whose inhabitants envy each of their neigh- bours, and are scorned by both. He was self-condemned to this opinion, as he was self-exiled, through it, to this quaint Southern city a thousand miles from his former home. Here he had dwelt for longer than a year, know- ing but few, keeping in a subjective world of shadows which was invaded at times by the perplexing bulks of jarring realities. Then he fell in love with a girl whom he met in a cheap restaurant, and his story begins.<br><br>    The Rue Chartres, in New Orleans, is a street of ghosts. It lies in the quarter where the Frenchman, in his prime, set up his translated pride and glory; where, also, the arrogant don had swaggered, and dreamed of gold and grants and ladies' gloves. Every flagstone has its grooves worn by footsteps going royally to the wooing and the fighting. Every house has a princely heartbreak; each doorway its untold tale of gallant promise and slow decay.<br><br>    By night the Rue Chartres is now but a murky fissure, from which the groping wayfarer sees, flung against the sky, the tangled filigree of Moorish iron balconies. Ths old houses of monsieur stand yet, indomitable against the century, but their essence is gone. The street is one of ghosts to whosoever can see them.<br><br>    A faint heartbeat of the street's ancient glory still sur- vives in a corner occupied by the Caf Carabine d'Or. Once men gathered there to plot against kings, and to warn presidents. They do so yet, but they are not the same kind of men. A brass button will scatter these; those would have set their faces against an army. Above the door hangs the sign board, upon which has been depicted a vast animal of unfamiliar species. In the act of firing upon this monster is represented an unobtrusive human levelling an obtrusive gun, once the colour of bright gold. Now the legend above the picture is faded beyond conjecture; the gun's relation to the title is a matter of faith; the menaced animal, wearied of the long aim of the hunter, has resolved itself into a shapeless blot.<br><br>    The place is known as ""Antonio's,"" as the name, white upon the red-lit transparency, and gilt upon the windows, attests. There is a promise in ""Antonio""; a justifiable expectancy of savoury things in oil and pepper and wine, and perhaps an angel's whisper of garlic. But the rest of the name is ""O'Riley."" Antonio O'Riley!<br><br>    The Carabine d'Or is an ignominious ghost of the Rue Chartres. The caf where Bienville and Conti dined, where a prince has broken bread, is become a ""family ristaurant.""<br><br>    Its customers are working men and women, almost to a unit. Occasionally you will see chorus girls from the cheaper theatres, and men who follow avocations sub- ject to quick vicissitudes; but at Antonio's -- name rich in Bohemian promise, but tame in fulfillment -- manners debonair and gay are toned down to the ""family"" stand- ard. Should you light a cigarette, mine host will touch you on the ""arrum"" and remind you that the proprieties are menaced. ""Antonio"" entices and beguiles from fiery legend without, but ""O'Riley"" teaches decorum within.<br><br>    It was at this restaurant that Lorison first saw the girl. A flashy fellow with a predatory eye had followed her in, and had advanced to take the other chair at the little table where she stopped, but Lorison slipped into the seat before him. Their acquaintance began, and grew, and how for two months they had sat at the same table each evening, not meeting by appointment, but as if by a series of fortuitous and happy accidents. After dining, they would take a walk together in one of the little city parks, or among the panoramic markets where exhibits a con- tinuous vaudeville of sights and sounds. Always at eight o'clock their steps led them to a certain street corner, where she prettily but firmly bade him good night and left him. ""I do not live far from here,"" she frequently said, ""and you must let me go the rest of the way alone.""<br><br>    But now Lorison had discovered that he wanted to go the rest of the way with her, or happiness would depart, leaving, him on a very lonely corner of life. And at the same time that he made the discovery, the secret of his banishment from the society of the good laid its finger in his face and told him it must not be.<br><br>    Man is too thoroughly an egoist not to be also an egotist; if he love, the object shall know it. During a lifetime he may conceal it through stress of expediency and honour, but it shall bubble from his dying lips, though it disrupt a neighbourhood. It is known, however, that most men do not wait so long to disclose their passion. In the case of Lorison, his particular ethics positively forbade him to declare his sentiments, but he must needs dally with the subject, and woo by innuendo at least.<br><br>    On this night, after the usual meal at the Carabine d'Or, he strolled with his companion down the dim old street toward the river<br><br>    The Rue Chartres perishes in the old Place d'Armes. The ancient Cabildo, where Spanish justice fell like hail, faces it, and the Cathedral, another provincial ghost, overlooks it. Its centre is a little, iron-railed park of flowers and immaculate gravelled walks, where citizens take the air of evenings. Pedestalled high above it, the general sits his cavorting steed, with his face turned stonily down the river toward English Turn, whence come no more Britons to bombard his cotton bales.<br><br>    Often the two sat in this square, but to-night Lorison guided her past the stone-stepped gate, and still riverward. As they walked, he smiled to himself to think that all he knew of her -- except that be loved her -- was her name, Norah Greenway, and that she lived with her brother. They had talked about everything except themselves. Perhaps her reticence had been caused by his.<br><br>    They came, at length, upon the levee, and sat upon a great, prostrate beam. The air was pungent with the dust of commerce. The great river slipped yellowly past. Across it Algiers lay, a longitudinous black bulk against a vibrant electric haze sprinkled with exact stars.<br><br>    The girl was young and of the piquant order. A certain bright melancholy pervaded her; she possessed an untarnished, pale prettiness doomed to please. Her voice, when she spoke, dwarfed her theme. It was the voice capable of investing little subjects with a large interest. She sat at ease, bestowing her skirts with the little womanly touch, serene as if the begrimed pier were a summer garden. Lorison poked the rotting boards with his cane.<br><br>    He began by telling her that he was in love with some one to whom he durst not speak of it. ""And why not?"" she asked, accepting swiftly his fatuous presentation of a third person of straw. ""My place in the world,"" he answered, ""is none to ask a woman to share. I am an outcast from honest people; I am wrongly accused of one crime, and am, I believe, guilty of another.""<br><br>    Thence he plunged into the story of his abdication from society. The story, pruned of his moral philosophy, deserves no more than the slightest touch. It is no new tale, that of the gambler's declension. During one night's sitting he lost, and then had imperilled a certain amount of his employer's money, which, by accident, he carried with him. He continued to lose, to the last wager, and then began to gain, leaving the game winner to a somewhat formidable sum. The same night his employer's safe was robbed. A search was had; the winnings of Lorison were found in his room, their total forming an accusative nearness to the sum purloined. He was taken, tried and, through incomplete evidence, released, smutched with the sinister devoirs of a dis- agreeing jury.<br><br>    ""It is not in the unjust accusation,"" he said to the girl, ""that my burden lies, but in the knowledge that from the moment I staked the first dollar of the firm's money I was a criminal -- no matter whether I lost or won. You see why it is impossible for me to speak of love to her.""<br><br>    ""It is a sad thing,"" said Norah, after a little pause. ""to think what very good people there are in the world.""<br><br>    ""Good?"" said Lorison.<br><br>    ""I was thinking of this superior person whom you say you love. She must be a very poor sort of creature.""<br><br>    ""I do not understand.""<br><br>    ""Nearly,"" she continued, ""as poor a sort of creature as yourself.""<br><br>    ""You do not understand,"" said Lorison, removing his hat and sweeping back his fine, light hair. ""Suppose she loved me in return, and were willing to marry me. Think, if you can, what would follow. Never a day Would pass but she would be reminded of her sacrifice. I would read a condescension in her smile, a pity even in her affection, that would madden me. No. The thing would stand between us forever. Only equals should mate. I could never ask her to come down upon my lower plane.""<br><br>    An arc light faintly shone upon Lorison's face. An illumination from within also pervaded it. The girl saw the rapt, ascetic look; it was the face either of Sir Galahad or Sir Fool.<br><br>    ""Quite starlike,"" she said, ""is this unapproachable angel. Really too high to be grasped.""<br><br>    ""By me, yes.""<br><br>    She faced him suddenly. ""My dear friend, would you prefer your star fallen?"" Lorison made a wide gesture.<br><br>    ""You push me to the bald fact,"" he declared; ""you are not in sympathy with my argument. But I will answer you so. If I could reach my particular star, to drag it down, I would not do it; but if it were fallen, I would pick it up, and thank Heaven for the privilege.""<br><br>    They were silent for some minutes. Norah shivered, and thrust her hands deep into the pockets of her jacket. Lorison uttered a remorseful exclamation.<br><br>    ""I'm not cold,"" she said. ""I was just thinking. I ought to tell you something. You have selected a strange confidante. But you cannot expect a chance acquain- ance, picked up in a doubtful restaurant, to be an angel.""<br><br>    ""Norah!"" cried Lorison.<br><br>    ""Let me go on. You have told me about yourself. We have been such good friends. I must tell you now what I never wanted you to know. I am -- worse than you are. I was on the stage . . . I sang in the chorus . . . I was pretty bad, I guess . . . I stole diamonds from the prima donna . . . they arrested me . . . I gave most of them up, and they let me go . . . I drank wine every night . . . a great deal . . . I was very wicked, but -- ""<br><br>    Lorison knelt quickly by her side and took her hands.<br><br>    ""Dear Norah!"" he said, exultantly. ""It is you, it is you I love! You never guessed it, did you? 'Tis you I meant all the time. Now I can speak. Let me make you forget the past. We have both suffered; let us shut out the world, and live for each other. Norah, do you hear me say I love you?""<br><br>    ""In spite of -- ""<br><br>    ""Rather say because of it. You have come out of your past noble and good. Your heart is an angel's, Give it to me.""<br><br>    ""A little while ago you feared the future too much to even speak.""<br><br>    ""But for you; not for myself. Can you love me?""<br><br>    She cast herself, wildly sobbing, upon his breast.<br><br>    ""Better than life -- than truth itself -- than every- thing.""<br><br>    ""And my own past,"" said Lorison, with a note of solicitude -- ""can you forgive and -- ""<br><br>    ""I answered you that,"" she whispered, ""when I told you I loved you."" She leaned away, and looked thought- fully at him. ""If I had not told you about myself, would you have -- would you -- ""<br><br>    ""No,"" he interrupted; ""I would never have let you know I loved you. I would never have asked you this -- Norah, will you be my wife?""<br><br>    She wept again.<br><br>    ""Oh, believe me; I am good now -- I am no longer wicked! I will be the best wife in the world. Don't think I am -- bad any more. If you do I shall die, I shall die!""<br><br>    While he was consoling, her, she brightened up, eager and impetuous. ""Will vou marry me to-night?"" she said. ""Will you prove it that way. I have a reason for wishing it to be to-night. Will you?""<br><br>    Of one of two things was this exceeding frankness the outcome: either of importunate brazenness or of utter innocence. The lover's perspective contained only the one.<br><br>    ""The sooner,"" said Lorison, ""the happier I shall be.""<br><br>    ""What is there to do?"" she asked. ""What do you have to get? Come! You should know.""<br><br>    Her energy stirred the dreamer to action.<br><br>    ""A city directory first,"" he cried, gayly, ""to find where the man lives who gives licenses to happiness. We will go together and rout him out. Cabs, cars, policemen, telephones and ministers shall aid us.""<br><br>    ""Father Rogan shall marry us,"" said the girl, with ardour. ""I will take you to him.""<br><br>    An hour later the two stood at the open doorway of an immense, gloomy brick building in a narrow and lonely street. The license was tight in Norah's hand.<br><br>    ""Wait here a moment,"" she said, ""till I find Father Rogan.""<br><br>    She plunged into the black hallway, and the lover was left standing, as it were, on one leg, outside. His impa- tience was not greatly taxed. Gazing curiously into what seemed the hallway to Erebus, he was presently reassured by a stream of light that bisected the darkness, far down the passage. Then he heard her call, and fluttered lampward, like the moth. She beckoned him through a doorway into the room whence emanated the light. The room was bare of nearly everything except books, which had subjugated all its space. Here and there little spots of territory had been reconquered. An elderly, bald man, with a superlatively calm, remote eye, stood by a table with a book in his hand, his finger still marking a page. His dress was sombre and appertained to a religious order. His eye denoted an acquaintance with the perspective.<br><br>    ""Father Rogan,"" said Norah, ""this is he.""<br><br>    ""The two of ye,"" said Father Rogan, ""want to get married?""<br><br>    They did not deny it. He married them. The cere- mony was quickly done. One who could have witnessed it, and felt its scope, might have trembled at the terrible inadequacy of it to rise to the dignity of its endless chain of results.<br><br>    Afterward the priest spake briefly, as if by rote, of certain other civil and legal addenda that either might or should, at a later time, cap the ceremony. Lorison tendered a fee, which was declined, and before the door closed after the departing couple Father Rogan's book popped open again where his finger marked it.<br><br>    In the dark hall Norah whirled and clung to her com- panion, tearful.<br><br>    ""Will you never, never be sorry?""<br><br>    At last she was reassured.<br><br>    At the first light they reached upon the street, she asked the time, just as she had each night. Lorison looked at his watch. Half-past eight.<br><br>    Lorison thought it was from habit that she guided their steps toward the corner where they always parted. But, arrived there, she hesitated, and then released his arm. A drug store stood on the corner; its bright, soft light shone upon them.<br><br>    ""Please leave me here as usual to-night,"" said Norah, sweetly. ""I must -- I would rather you would. You will not object? At six to-morrow evening I will meet you at Antonio's. I want to sit with vou there once more. And then -- I will go where you say."" She gave him a bewildering, bright smile, and walked swiftly away.<br><br>    Surely it needed all the strength of her charm to carry off this astounding behaviour. It was no discredit to Lorison's strength of mind that his head began to whirl. Pocketing his hands, he rambled vacuously over to the druggist's windows, and began assiduously to spell over the names of the patent medicines therein displayed.<br><br>    As soon as be had recovered his wits, he proceeded along the street in an aimless fashion. After drifting for two or three squares, he flowed into a somewhat more pretentious thoroughfare, a way much frequented by him in his solitary ramblings. For here was a row of slops devoted to traffic in goods of the widest range of choice -- handiworks of art, skill and fancy, products of nature and labour from every zone.<br><br>    Here, for a time, he loitered among the conspicuous windows, where was set, emphasized bv congested floods of light, the cunningest spoil of the interiors. There were few passers, and of this Lorison was glad. He was not of the world. For a long time he had touched his fellow man only at the gear of a levelled cog-wheel -- at right angles, and upon a different axis. He had dropped into a distinctly new orbit. The stroke of ill fortune had acted upon him, in effect, as a blow delivered upon the apex of a certain ingenious toy, the musical top, which- when thus buffeted while spinning, gives forth, with scarcely retarded motion, a complete change of key and chord.<br><br>    Strolling along the pacific avenue, he experienced singular, supernatural calm, accompanied by an unusual a activity of brain. Reflecting upon recent affairs, be assured himself of his happiness in having won for a bride the one he had so greatly desired, yet he wondered mildly at his dearth of active emotion. Her strange behaviour in abandoning him without valid excuse on his bridal eve aroused in him only a vague and curious speculation. Again, he found himself contemplating, with complaisant serenity, the incidents of her somewhat lively career. His perspective seemed to have been queerly shifted.<br><br>    As he stood before a window near a corner, his ears were assailed by a waxing clamour and commotion. He stood close to the window to allow passage to the cause of the hubbub -- a procession of human beings, which rounded the corner aid headed in his direction. He perceived a salient hue of blue and a glitter of brass about a central figure of dazzling white and silver, and a ragged wake of black, bobbing figures.<br><br>    Two ponderous policemen Were conducting between them a woman dressed as if for the stage, in a short, white, satiny skirt reaching to the knees, pink stockings, and a sort of sleeveless bodice bright with relucent, armour-like scales. Upon her curly, light hair was perched, at a rollicking angle, a shining tin helmet. The costume was to be instantly recognized as one of those amazing con- ceptions to which competition has harried the inventors of the spectacular ballet. One of the officers bore a long cloak upon his axm, which, doubtless, had been intended to veil the I candid attractions of their effulgent prisoner, but, for some reason, it had not been called into use, to the vociferous delight of the tail of the procession.<br><br>    Compelled by a sudden and vigorous movement of the woman, the parade halted before the window by which Lorison stood. He saw that she was young, and, at the first glance, was deceived by a sophistical prettiness of her face, which waned before a more judicious scrutiny. Her look was bold and reckless, and upon her countenance, where yet the contours of youth survived, were the finger- marks of old age's credentialed courier, Late Hours.<br><br>    The young woman fixed her unshrinking gaze upon Lorison, and called to him in the voice of the wronged heroine in straits:<br><br>    ""Say! You look like a good fellow; come and put up the bail, won't you? I've done nothing to get pinched for. It's all a mistake. See how they're treating me! You won't be sorry, if you'll help me out of this. Think of your sister or your girl being dragged along the streets this way! I say, come along now, like a good fellow.""<br><br>    It may be that Lorison, in spite of the unconvincing bathos of this appeal, showed a sympathetic face, for one of the officers left the woman's side, and went over to him.<br><br>    ""It's all right, Sir,"" he said, in a husky, confidential tone; ""she's the right party. We took her after the first act at the Green Light Theatre, on a wire from the chief of police of Chicago. It's only a square or two to the station. Her rig's pretty bad, but she refused to change clothes -- or, rather,"" added the officer, with a smile, ""to put on some. I thought I'd explain matters to you so you wouldn't think she was being imposed upon.""<br><br>    ""What is the charge?"" asked Lorison.<br><br>    ""Grand larceny. Diamonds. Her husband is a jeweller in Chicago. She cleaned his show case of the sparklers, and skipped with a comic-opera troupe.""<br><br>    The policeman, perceiving that the interest of the entire group of spectators was centred upon himself and Lorison -- their conference being regarded as a possible new com- plication -- was fain to prolong the situation -- which reflected his own importance -- by a little afterpiece of philosophical comment.<br><br>    ""A gentleman like you, Sir,"" he went on affably, ""would never notice it, but it comes in my line to observe what an immense amount of trouble is made by that com- bination -- I mean the stage, diamonds and light-headed women who aren't satisfied with good homes. I tell you, Sir, a man these days and nights wants to know what his women folks are up to.""<br><br>    The policeman smiled a good night, and returned to the side of his charge, who had been intently watching Lorison's face during the conversation, no doubt for some indication of his intention to render succour. Now, at the failure of the sign, and at the movement made to continue the ignominious progress, she abandoned hope, and addressed him thus, pointedly:<br><br>    ""You damn chalk-faced quitter! You was thinking of giving me a hand, but you let the cop talk you out of it the first word. You're a dandy to tie to. Say, if you ever get a girl, she'll have a picnic. Won't she work you to the queen's taste! Oh, my!"" She concluded with a taunting, shrill laugh that rasped Lorison like a saw. The policemen urged her forward; the delighted train of gaping followers closed up the rear; and the captive Amazon, accepting her fate, extended the scope of her maledictions so that none in hearing might seem to be slighted.<br><br>    Then there came upon Lorison an overwhelming revulsion of his perspective. It may be that he had been ripe for it, that the abnormal condition of mind in which he had for so long existed was already about to revert to its balance; however, it is certain that the events of the last few minutes had furnished the channel, if not the impetus, for the change.<br><br>    The initial determining influence had been so small a thing as the fact and manner of his having been approached by the officer. That agent had, by the style of his accost, restored the loiterer to his former place in society. In an instant he had been transformed from a somewhat rancid prowler along the fishy side streets of gentility into an honest gentleman, with whom even so lordly a guardian of the peace might agreeably exchange the compliments.<br><br>    This, then, first broke the spell, and set thrilling in him a resurrected longing for the fellowship of his kind, and the rewards of the virtuous. To what end, he vehemently asked himself, was this fanciful self-accusation, this empty renunciation, this moral squeamishness through which he had been led to abandon what was his heritage in life, and not beyond his deserts? Technically, he was uncondemned; his sole guilty spot was in thought rather than deed, and cognizance of it unshared by others. For what good, moral or sentimental, did he slink, retreating like the hedgehog from his own shadow, to and fro in this musty Bohemia that lacked even the picturesque?<br><br>    But the thing that struck home and set him raging was the part played by the Amazonian prisoner. To the counterpart of that astounding belligerent -- identical at least, in the way of experience -- to one, by her own confession, thus far fallen, had he, not three hours since, been united in marriage. How desirable and natural it had seemed to him then, and how monstrous it seemed now! How the words of diamond thief number two yet burned in his ears: ""If you ever get a cirl, she'll have a picnic. What did that that this women instinc- tively knew him for one they could hoodwink? Still again, there reverberated the policeman's sapient contribution to his agony: ""A man these days and nights wants to know what his women folks are up to."" Oh, yes, he had been a fool; he had looked at things from the wrong standpoint.<br><br>    But the wildest note in all the clamour was struck by pain's forefinger, jealousy. Now, at least, he felt that keenest sting -- a mounting love unworthily bestowed. Whatever she might be, he loved her; he bore in his own breast his doom. A grating, comic flavour to his pre- dicament struck him suddenly, and he laughed creakingly as he swung down the echoing pavement. An impetuous desire to act, to battle with his fate, seized him. He stopped upon his heel, and smote his palms together triumphantly. His wife was -- where? But there was a tangible link; an outlet more or less navigable, through which his derelict ship of matrimony might yet be safely towed -- the priest!<br><br>    Like all imaginative men with pliable natures, Lorison was, when thoroughly stirred, apt to become tempest- uous. With a high and stubborn indignation upon him, be retraced his steps to the intersecting street by which he had come. Down this he hurried to the corner where he had parted with -- an astringent grimace tinctured the thought -- his wife. Thence still back he harked, follow- ing through an unfamiliar district his stimulated recollec- tions of the way they had come from that preposterous wedding. Many times he went abroad, and nosed his way back to, the trail, furious.<br><br>    At last, when he reached the dark, calamitous building in which his madness had culminated, and found the black hallway, he dashed down it, perceiving no light or sound. But he raised his voice, hailing loudly; reckless of everything but that he should find the old mischief- maker with the eyes that looked too far awav to see the disaster he had wrought. The door opened, and in the stream of light Father Rogan stood, his book in hand, with his finger marking the place.<br><br>    ""Ah!"" cried Lorison. ""You are the man I want. I had a wife of you a few hours ago. I would not trouble you, but I neglected to note how it was done. Will you oblige me with the information whether the business is beyond remedy?""<br><br>    ""Come inside,"" said the priest; ""there are other lodgers in the house, who might prefer sleep to even a gratified curiosity.""<br><br>    Lorison entered the room and took the chair offered him. The priest's eyes looked a courteous interrogation.<br><br>    ""I must apologize again,"" said the young man, ""for so soon intruding upon you with my marital infelicities, but, as my wife has neglected to furnish me with her address, I am deprived of the legitimate recourse of a family row.""<br><br>    ""I am quite a plain man,"" said Father Rogan, pleas- antly; ""but I do not see how I am to ask you questions.""<br><br>    ""Pardon my indirectness,"" said Lorison; ""I will ask one. In this room to-night you pronounced me to be a husband. You afterward spoke of additional rites or performances that either should or could be effected. I paid little attention to your words then, but I am hungry to hear them repeated now. As matters stand, am I married past all help?""<br><br>    ""You are as legally and as firmly bound,"" said the priest, ""as though it had been done in a cathedral, in the presence of thousands. The additional observances I referred to are not necessary to the strictest legality of the act, but were advised as a precaution for the future -- for convenience of proof in such contingencies as wills, inheritances and the like.""<br><br>    Lorison laughed harshly.<br><br>    ""Many thanks,"" he said. ""Then there is no mistake, and I am the happy benedict. I suppose I should go stand upon the bridal corner, and when my wife gets through walking the streets she will look me up.""<br><br>    Father Rogan regarded him calmly.<br><br>    ""My son,"" he said, ""when a man and woman come to me to be married I always marry them. I do this for the sake of other people whom they might go away and marry if they did not marry each other. As you see, I do not seek your confidence; but your case seems to me to be one not altogether devoid of interest. Very few marriages that have come to my notice have brought such well- expressed regret within so short a time. I will hazard one question: were you not under the impression that you loved the lady you married, at the time you did so;""<br><br>    ""Loved her!"" cried Lorison, wildly. ""Never so well as now, though she told me she deceived and sinned and stole. Never more than now, when, perhaps, she is laughing at the fool she cajoled and left, with scarcely a word, to return to God only knows what particular line of her former folly.""<br><br>    Father Rooan answered nothing. During the silence that succeeded, he sat with a quiet expectation beaming in his full, lambent eye.<br><br>    ""If you would listen -- "" began Lorison. The priest held up his hand.<br><br>    ""As I hoped,"" he said. ""I thought you would trust me. Wait but a moment."" He brought a long clay pipe, filled and lighted it.<br><br>    ""Now, my son,"" he said.<br><br>    Lorison poured a twelve month's accumulated con- fidence into Father Rogan's ear. He told all; not sparing himself or omitting the facts of his past, the events of the night, or his disturbing conjectures and fears.<br><br>    ""The main point,"" said the priest, when he had con- cluded, ""seems to me to be this -- are you reasonably sure that you love this woman whom you have married?""<br><br>    ""Why,"" exclaimed Lorisoii, rising impulsively to his feet - ""why should I deny it? But look at me -- am fish, flesh or fowl? That is the main point to me, assure you.""<br><br>    ""I understand you,"" said the priest, also risino,, and laying down his pipe. ""The situation is one that has taxed the endurance of much older men than you -- in fact, especially much older men than you. I will try to relieve you from it, and this night. You shall see for yourself into exactly what predicament you have fallen, and how you shall, possibly, be extricated. There is no evidence so credible as that of the eyesight.""<br><br>    Father Rogan moved about the room, and donned a soft black hat. Buttoning his coat to his throat, he laid his hand on the doorknob. ""Let us walk,"" he said.<br><br>    The two went out upon the street. The priest turned his face down it, and Lorison walked with him through a squalid district, where the houses loomed, awry and desoiate-looking, high above them. Presently they turned into a less dismal side street, where the houses were smaller, and, though hinting of the most meagre comfort, lacked the concentrated wretchedness of the more populous byways.<br><br>    At a segregated, two-story house Father Rogan halted, and mounted the steps with the confidence of a familiar visitor. He ushered Lorison into a narrow hallway, faintly lighted by a cobwebbed hanging lamp. Almost immediately a door to the right opened and a dingy Irish- woman protruded her head.<br><br>    ""Good evening to ye, Mistress Geehan,"" said the priest, unconsciously, it seemed, falling into a delicately flavoured brogue. ""And is it yourself can tell me if Norah has gone out again, the night, maybe?""<br><br>    ""Oh, it's yer blissid reverence! Sure and I can tell ye the same. The purty darlin' wint out, as usual, but a bit later. And she says: 'Mother Geehan,' says she, 'it's me last noight out, praise the saints, this noight is!' And, oh, yer reverence, the swate, beautiful drame of a dress she had this toime! White satin and silk and ribbons, and lace about the neck and arrums -- 'twas a sin, yer reverence, the gold was spint upon it.""<br><br>    The priest heard Lorison catch his breath painfully, and a faint smile flickered across his own clean-cut mouth.<br><br>    ""Well, then, Mistress Geehan,"" said he, ""I'll just step upstairs and see the bit boy for a minute, and I'll take this Gentleman up with me.""<br><br>    ""He's awake, thin,"" said the woman. 'I've just come down from sitting wid him the last hour, tilling him fine shtories of ould County Tyrone. 'Tis a greedy gos- soon, it is, yer riverence, for me shtories.""<br><br>    ""Small the doubt,"" said Father Rogan. ""There's no rocking would put him to slape the quicker, I'm thinking.""<br><br>    Amid the woman's shrill protest against the retort, the two men ascended the steep stairway. The priest pushed open the door of a room near its top.<br><br>    ""Is that you already, sister?"" drawled a sweet, childish voice from the darkness.<br><br>    ""It's only ould Father Denny come to see ye, darlin'; and a foine gentleman I've brought to make ye a gr-r-and call. And ye resaves us fast aslape in bed! Shame on yez manners!""<br><br>    ""Oh, Father Denny, is that you? I'm glad. And will you light the lamp, please? It's on the table by the door. And quit talking like Mother Geehan, Father Denny.""<br><br>    The priest lit the lamp, and Lorison saw a tiny, towsled- haired boy, with a thin, delicate face, sitting up in a small bed in a corner. Quickly, also, his rapid glance con- sidered the room and its contents. It was furnished with more than comfort, and its adornments plainly indicated a woman's discerning taste. An open door beyond revealed the blackness of an adjoining room's interior.<br><br>    The boy clutched both of Father Rogan's hands. ""I'm so glad you came,"" he said; ""but why did you come in the night? Did sister send you?""<br><br>    ""Off wid ye! Am I to be sint about, at me age, as was Terence McShane, of Ballymahone? I come on me own r-r-responsibility.""<br><br>    Lorison had also advanced to the boy's bedside. He was fond of children; and the wee fellow, laving himself down to sleep alone ill that dark room, stirred-his heart.<br><br>    ""Aren't you afraid, little man?"" he asked, stooping down beside him.<br><br>    ""Sometimes,"" answered the boy, with a shy smile, ""when the rats make too much noise. But nearly every night, when sister goes out, Molt-her Geehan stays a while with me, and tells me funny stories. I'm not often afraid, sir.""<br><br>    ""This brave little gentleman,"" said Father Rogan, ""is a scholar of mine. Every day from half-past six to half- past eight -- when sister comes for him -- he stops in my study, and we find out what's in the inside of books. He knows multiplication, division and fractions; and he's troubling me to begin wid the chronicles of Ciaran of Clonmaciioise, Corurac McCullenan and Cuan O'Loc- hain, the gr-r-reat Irish histhorians."" The boy was evidently accustomed to the priest's Celtic pleasantries. A little, appreciative grin was all the attention the insin- nation of pedantry received.<br><br>    Lorison, to have saved his life, could not have put to the child one of those vital questions that were wildly beating about, unanswered, in his own brain. The little fellow was very like Norah; he had the same shining hair and candid eyes.<br><br>    ""Oh, Father Denny,"" cried the boy, suddenly, ""I forgot to tell you! Sister is not going away at night any more! She told me so when she kissed me good night as she was leaving. And she said she was so happy, and then she cried. Wasn't that queer? But I'm glad; aren't you?""<br><br>    ""Yes, lad. And now, ye omadhaun, go to sleep, and say good night; we must be going.""<br><br>    ""Which shall I do first, Father Denny?""<br><br>    ""Faith, he's caught me again! Wait till I get the sassenach into the annals of Tageruach, the hagiographer; I'll give him enough of the Irish idiom to make him more respectful.""<br><br>    The light was out, and the small, brave voice bidding them good night from the dark room. They groped downstairs, and tore away from the garrulity of Mother Geehan.<br><br>    Again the priest steered them through the dim ways, but this time in another direction. His conductor was serenely silent, and Lorison followed his example to the extent of seldom speaking. Serene he could not be. His heart beat suffocatingly in his breast. The following of this blind, menacing trail was pregnant with he knew not what humiliating revelation to be delivered at its end.<br><br>    They came into a more pretentious street, where trade, it could be surmised, flourished by day. And again the priest paused; this time before a lofty building, whose great doors and windows in the lowest floor were carefully shuttered and barred. Its higher apertures were dark, save in the third story, the windows of which were bril- liantly lighted. Lorison's ear caught a distant, regular, pleasing thrumming, as of music above. They stood at an angle of the building. Up, along the side nearest them, mounted an iron stairway. At its top was an upright, illuminated parallelogram. Father Rogan had stopped, and stood, musing.<br><br>    ""I will say this much,"" he remarked, thoughtfully: ""I believe you to be a better man than you think yourself to be, and a better man than I thought some hours ago. But do not take this,"" he added, with a smile, ""as much praise. I promised you a possible deliverance from an unhappy perplexity. I will have to modify that promise. I can only remove the mystery that enhanced that per- plexity. Your deliverance depends upon yourself. Come.""<br><br>    He led his companion up the stairway. Halfway up, Lorison caught him by the sleeve. ""Remember,"" he gasped, ""I love that woman.""<br><br>    ""You desired to know.<br><br>    ""I -- Go on.""<br><br>    The priest reached the landing at the top of the stairway. Lorison, behind him, saw that the illuminated space was the glass upper half of a door opening into the lighted room. The rhythmic music increased as they neared it; the stairs shook with the mellow vibrations.<br><br>    Lorison stopped breathing when he set foot upon the highest step, for the priest stood aside, and motioned him to look through the glass of the door.<br><br>    His eye, accustomed to the darkness, met first a blind- ing glare, and then he made out the faces and forms of many people, amid an extravagant display of splendid robings -- billowy laces, brilliant-hued finery, ribbons, silks and misty drapery. And then he caught the mean. ing of that jarring hum, and he saw the tired, pale, happy face of his wife, bending, as were a score of others, over her sewing machine -- toiling, toiling. Here was the folly she pursued, and the end of his quest.<br><br>    But not his deliverance, though even then remorse struck him. His shamed soul fluttered once more before it retired to make room for the other and better one. For, to temper his thrill of joy, the shine of the satin and the glimmer of ornaments recalled the disturbing figure of the bespangled Amazon, and the base duplicate histories it by the glare of footlights and stolen diamonds. It is past the wisdom of him who only sets the scenes, either to praise or blame the man. But this time his love over- came his scruples. He took a quick step, and reached out his hand for the doorknob. Father Rogan was quicker to arrest it and draw him back.<br><br>    ""You use my trust in you queerly,"" said the priest sternly. ""What are you about to do?""<br><br>    ""I am going to my wife,"" said Lorison. ""Let me pass.""<br><br>    ""Listen,"" said the priest, holding him firmly by the arm. ""I am about to put you in possession of a piece of knowledge of which, thus far, you have scarcely proved deserving. I do not think you ever will; but I will not dwell upon that. You see in that room the woman you married, working for a frugal living for herself, and a generous comfort for an idolized brother. This building belongs to the chief costumer of the city. For months the advance orders for the coming Mardi Gras festivals have kept the work going day and night. I myself secured employment here for Norah. She toils here each night from nine o'clock until daylight, and, besides, carries home with her some of the finer costumes, requiring more delicate needlework, and works there part of the day. Somehow, you two have remained strangely ignorant of each other's lives. Are you convinced now that your wife is not walking the streets?""<br><br>    ""Let me go to her,"" cried Lorison, again struggling, ""and beg her forgiveness!'<br><br>    ""Sir,"" said the priest, ""do you owe me nothing? Be quiet. It seems so often that Heaven lets fall its choicest gifts into hands that must be taught to hold them. Listen again. You forgot that repentant sin must not comprom- ise, but look up, for redemption, to the purest and best. You went to her with the fine-spun sophistry that peace could be found in a mutual guilt; and she, fearful of losing what her heart so craved, thought it worth the price to buy it with a desperate, pure, beautiful lie. I have known her since the day she was born; she is as innocent and unsullied in life and deed as a holy saint. In that lowly street where she dwells she first saw the light, and she has lived there ever since, spending her days in generous self-sacrifice for others. Och, ye spalpeen!"" continued Father Rogan, raising his finger in kindly anger at Lorison. ""What for, I wonder, could she be after making a fool of hersilf, and shamin' her swate soul with lies, for the like of you!""<br><br>    ""Sir,"" said Lorison, trembling, ""say what you please of me. Doubt it as you must, I will yet prove my gratitude to you, and my devotion to her. But let me speak to her once now, let me kneel for just one moment at her feet, and -- ""<br><br>    ""Tut, tut!"" said the priest. ""How many acts of a love drama do you think an old bookworm like me capable of witnessing? Besides, what kind of figures do we cut, spying upon the mysteries of midnight millinery! Go to meet your wife to-morrow, as she ordered you, and obey her thereafter, and maybe some time I shall get forgive- ness for the part I have played in this night's work. Off wid yez down the shtairs, now! 'Tis late, and an ould man like me should be takin' his rest.""                             <br><br>"
78,Brickdust Row,"  Blinker was displeased. A man of less culture and poise and wealth  would have sworn. But Blinker always remembered that he was a  gentleman--a thing that no gentleman should do. So he merely looked  bored and sardonic while he rode in a hansom to the center of  disturbance, which was the Broadway office of Lawyer Oldport, who  was agent for the Blinker estate.  <br><br>  ""I don't see,"" said Blinker, ""why I should be always signing  confounded papers. I am packed, and was to have left for the North  Woods this morning. Now I must wait until to-morrow morning. I hate  night trains. My best razors are, of course, at the bottom of some  unidentifiable trunk. It is a plot to drive me to bay rum and a  monologueing, thumb-handed barber. Give me a pen that doesn't  scratch. I hate pens that scratch.""  <br><br>  ""Sit down,"" said double-chinned, gray Lawyer Oldport. ""The worst has  not been told you. Oh, the hardships of the rich! The papers are not  yet ready to sign. They will be laid before you to-morrow at eleven.  You will miss another day. Twice shall the barber tweak the helpless  nose of a Blinker. Be thankful that your sorrows do not embrace a  haircut.""  <br><br>  ""If,"" said Blinker, rising, ""the act did not involve more signing of  papers I would take my business out of your hands at once. Give me a  cigar, please.""  <br><br>  ""If,"" said Lawyer Oldport, ""I had cared to see an old friend's son  gulped down at one mouthful by sharks I would have ordered you to  take it away long ago. Now, let's quit fooling, Alexander. Besides  the grinding task of signing your name some thirty times to-morrow,  I must impose upon you the consideration of a matter of business--of  business, and I may say humanity or right. I spoke to you about  this five years ago, but you would not listen--you were in a hurry  for a coaching trip, I think. The subject has come up again. The  property--""  <br><br>  ""Oh, property!"" interrupted Blinker. ""Dear Mr. Oldport, I  think you mentioned to-morrow. Let's have it all at one dose  to-morrow--signatures and property and snappy rubber bands and that  smelly sealing-wax and all. Have luncheon with me? Well, I'll try  to remember to drop in at eleven to-morrow. Morning.""  <br><br>  The Blinker wealth was in lands, tenements and hereditaments, as the  legal phrase goes. Lawyer Oldport had once taken Alexander in his  little pulmonary gasoline runabout to see the many buildings and  rows of buildings that he owned in the city. For Alexander was  sole heir. They had amused Blinker very much. The houses looked so  incapable of producing the big sums of money that Lawyer Oldport  kept piling up in banks for him to spend.  <br><br>  In the evening Blinker went to one of his clubs, intending to dine.  Nobody was there except some old fogies playing whist who spoke to  him with grave politeness and glared at him with savage contempt.  Everybody was out of town. But here he was kept in like a schoolboy  to write his name over and over on pieces of paper. His wounds were  deep.  <br><br>  Blinker turned his back on the fogies, and said to the club steward  who had come forward with some nonsense about cold fresh salmon roe:  <br><br>  ""Symons, I'm going to Coney Island."" He said it as one might say:  ""All's off; I'm going to jump into the river.""  <br><br>  The joke pleased Symons. He laughed within a sixteenth of a note of  the audibility permitted by the laws governing employees.  <br><br>  ""Certainly, sir,"" he tittered. ""Of course, sir, I think I can see  you at Coney, Mr. Blinker.""  <br><br>  Blinker got a pager and looked up the movements of Sunday  steamboats. Then he found a cab at the first corner and drove to a  North River pier. He stood in line, as democratic as you or I, and  bought a ticket, and was trampled upon and shoved forward until,  at last, he found himself on the upper deck of the boat staring  brazenly at a girl who sat alone upon a camp stool. But Blinker did  not intend to be brazen; the girl was so wonderfully good looking  that he forgot for one minute that he was the prince incog, and  behaved just as he did in society.  <br><br>  She was looking at him, too, and not severely. A puff of wind  threatened Blinker's straw hat. He caught it warily and settled it  again. The movement gave the effect of a bow. The girl nodded and  smiled, and in another instant he was seated at her side. She was  dressed all in white, she was paler than Blinker imagined milkmaids  and girls of humble stations to be, but she was as tidy as a cherry  blossom, and her steady, supremely frank gray eyes looked out from  the intrepid depths of an unshadowed and untroubled soul.  <br><br>  ""How dare you raise your hat to me?"" she asked, with a smile-redeemed  severity.  <br><br>  ""I didn't,"" Blinker said, but he quickly covered the mistake by  extending it to ""I didn't know how to keep from it after I saw you.""  <br><br>  ""I do not allow gentlemen to sit by me to whom I have not been  introduced,"" she said, with a sudden haughtiness that deceived him.  He rose reluctantly, but her clear, teasing laugh brought him down  to his chair again.  <br><br>  ""I guess you weren't going far,"" she declared, with beauty's  magnificent self-confidence.  <br><br>  ""Are you going to Coney Island?"" asked Blinker.  <br><br>  ""Me?"" She turned upon him wide-open eyes full of bantering surprise.  ""Why, what a question! Can't you see that I'm riding a bicycle in  the park?"" Her drollery took the form of impertinence.  <br><br>  ""And I am laying brick on a tall factory chimney,"" said Blinker.  ""Mayn't we see Coney together? I'm all alone and I've never been  there before."" ""It depends,"" said the girl, ""on how nicely you  behave. I'll consider your application until we get there.""  <br><br>  Blinker took pains to provide against the rejection of his  application. He strove to please. To adopt the metaphor of his  nonsensical phrase, he laid brick upon brick on the tall chimney of  his devoirs until, at length, the structure was stable and complete.  The manners of the best society come around finally to simplicity;  and as the girl's way was that naturally, they were on a mutual  plane of communication from the beginning.  <br><br>  He learned that she was twenty, and her name was Florence; that she  trimmed hats in a millinery shop; that she lived in a furnished room  with her best chum Ella, who was cashier in a shoe store; and that  a glass of milk from the bottle on the window-sill and an egg that  boils itself while you twist up your hair makes a breakfast good  enough for any one. Florence laughed when she heard ""Blinker.""  <br><br>  ""Well,"" she said. ""It certainly slows that you have imagination. It  gives the 'Smiths' a chance for a little rest, anyhow.""  <br><br>  They landed at Coney, and were dashed on the crest of a great human  wave of mad pleasure-seekers into the walks and avenues of Fairyland  gone into vaudeville.  <br><br>  With a curious eye, a critical mind and a fairly withheld judgment  Blinker considered the temples, pagodas and kiosks of popularized  delights. Hoi polloi trampled, hustled and crowded him. Basket  parties bumped him; sticky children tumbled, howling, under his  feet, candying his clothes. Insolent youths strolling among the  booths with hard-won canes under one arm and easily won girls on  the other, blew defiant smoke from cheap cigars into his face. The  publicity gentlemen with megaphones, each before his own stupendous  attraction, roared like Niagara in his ears. Music of all kinds that  could be tortured from brass, reed, hide or string, fought in the  air to grain space for its vibrations against its competitors. But  what held Blinker in awful fascination was the mob, the multitude,  the proletariat shrieking, struggling, hurrying, panting, hurling  itself in incontinent frenzy, with unabashed abandon, into the  ridiculous sham palaces of trumpery and tinsel pleasures, The  vulgarity of it, its brutal overriding of all the tenets of  repression and taste that were held by his caste, repelled him  strongly.  <br><br>  In the midst of his disgust he turned and looked down at Florence  by his side. She was ready with her quick smile and upturned, happy  eyes, as bright and clear as the water in trout pools. The eyes were  saying that they had the right to be shining and happy, for was  their owner not with her (for the present) Man, her Gentleman Friend  and holder of the keys to the enchanted city of fun?  <br><br>  Blinker did not read her look accurately, but by some miracle he  suddenly saw Coney aright.  <br><br>  He no longer saw a mass of vulgarians seeking gross joys. He now  looked clearly upon a hundred thousand true idealists. Their  offenses were wiped out. Counterfeit and false though the garish  joys of these spangled temples were, he perceived that deep  under the gilt surface they offered saving and apposite balm and  satisfaction to the restless human heart. Here, at least, was the  husk of Romance, the empty but shining casque of Chivalry, the  breath-catching though safe-guarded dip and flight of Adventure, the  magic carpet that transports you to the realms of fairyland, though  its journey be through but a few poor yards of space. He no longer  saw a rabble, but his brothers seeking the ideal. There was no magic  of poesy here or of art; but the glamour of their imagination turned  yellow calico into cloth of gold and the megaphones into the silver  trumpets of joy's heralds.  <br><br>  Almost humbled, Blinker rolled up the shirt sleeves of his mind and  joined the idealists.  <br><br>  ""You are the lady doctor,"" he said to Florence. ""How shall we go  about doing this jolly conglomeration of fairy tales, incorporated?""  <br><br>  ""We will begin there,"" said the Princess, pointing to a fun pagoda  on the edge of the sea, ""and we will take them all in, one by one.""  <br><br>  They caught the eight o'clock returning boat and sat, filled with  pleasant fatigue, against the rail in the bow, listening to the  Italians' fiddle and harp. Blinker had thrown off all care. The  North Woods seemed to him an uninhabitable wilderness. What a fuss  he had made over signing his name--pooh! he could sign it a hundred  times. And her name was as pretty as she was--""Florence,"" he said it  to himself a great many times.  <br><br>  As the boat was nearing its pier in the North River a two-funnelled,  drab, foreign-looking sea-going steamer was dropping down toward the  bay. The boat turned its nose in toward its slip. The steamer veered  as if to seek midstream, and then yawed, seemed to increase its  speed and struck the Coney boat on the side near the stern, cutting  into it with a terrifying shock and crash.  <br><br>  While the six hundred passengers on the boat were mostly tumbling  about the decks in a shrieking panic the captain was shouting at the  steamer that it should not back off and leave the rent exposed for  the water to enter. But the steamer tore its way out like a savage  sawfish and cleaved its heartless way, full speed ahead.  <br><br>  The boat began to sink at its stern, but moved slowly toward the  slip. The passengers were a frantic mob, unpleasant to behold.  <br><br>  Blinker held Florence tightly until the boat had righted itself.  She made no sound or sign of fear. He stood on a camp stool, ripped  off the slats above his head and pulled down a number of the life  preservers. He began to buckle one around Florence. The rotten  canvas split and the fraudulent granulated cork came pouring out in  a stream. Florence caught a handful of it and laughed gleefully.  <br><br>  ""It looks like breakfast food,"" she said. ""Take it off. They're no  good.""  <br><br>  She unbuckled it and threw it on the deck. She made Blinker sit down  and sat by his side and put her hand in his. ""What'll you bet we  don't reach the pier all right?"" she said and began to hum a song.  <br><br>  And now the captain moved among the passengers and compelled order.  The boat would undoubtedly make her slip, he said, and ordered the  women and children to the bow, where they could land first. The  boat, very low in the water at the stern, tried gallantly to make  his promise good.  <br><br>  ""Florence,"" said Blinker, as she held him close by an arm and hand,  ""I love you.""  <br><br>  ""That's what they all say,"" she replied, lightly.  <br><br>  ""I am not one of 'they all,'"" he persisted. ""I never knew any one I  could love before. I could pass my life with you and be happy every  day. I am rich. I can make things all right for you.""  <br><br>  ""That's what they all say,"" said the girl again, weaving the words  into her little, reckless song.  <br><br>  ""Don't say that again,"" said Blinker in a tone that made her look at  him in frank surprise.  <br><br>  ""Why shouldn't I say it?"" she asked calmly. ""They all do.""  <br><br>  ""Who are 'they'?"" he asked, jealous for the first time in his  existence.  <br><br>  ""Why, the fellows I know.""  <br><br>  ""Do you know so many?""  <br><br>  ""Oh, well, I'm not a wall flower,"" she answered with modest  complacency.  <br><br>  ""Where do you see these--these men? At your home?""  <br><br>  ""Of course not. I meet them just as I did you. Sometimes on the  boat, sometimes in the park, sometimes on the street. I'm a pretty  good judge of a man. I can tell in a minute if a fellow is one who  is likely to get fresh.""  <br><br>  ""What do you mean by 'fresh?'""  <br><br>  ""Why, try to kiss you--me, I mean.""  <br><br>  ""Do any of them try that?"" asked Blinker, clenching his teeth.  <br><br>  ""Sure. All men do. You know that.""  <br><br>  ""Do you allow them?""  <br><br>  ""Some. Not many. They won't take you out anywhere unless you do.""  <br><br>  She turned her head and looked searchingly at Blinker. Her eyes  were as innocent as a child's. There was a puzzled look in them,  as though she did not understand him.  <br><br>  ""What's wrong about my meeting fellows?"" she asked, wonderingly.  <br><br>  ""Everything,"" he answered, almost savagely. ""Why don't you entertain  your company in the house where you live? Is it necessary to pick up  Tom, Dick and Harry on the streets?""  <br><br>  She kept her absolutely ingenuous eyes upon his. ""If you could see  the place where I live you wouldn't ask that. I live in Brickdust  Row. They call it that because there's red dust from the bricks  crumbling over everything. I've lived there for more than four  years. There's no place to receive company. You can't have anybody  come to your room. What else is there to do? A girl has got to meet  the men, hasn't she?""  <br><br>  ""Yes,"" he said, hoarsely. ""A girl has got to meet a--has got to meet  the men.""  <br><br>  ""The first time one spoke to me on the street,"" she continued, ""I  ran home and cried all night. But you get used to it. I meet a good  many nice fellows at church. I go on rainy days and stand in the  vestibule until one comes up with an umbrella. I wish there was a  parlor, so I could ask you to call, Mr. Blinker--are you really sure  it isn't 'Smith,' now?""  <br><br>  The boat landed safely. Blinker had a confused impression of walking  with the girl through quiet crosstown streets until she stopped at a  corner and held out her hand.  <br><br>  ""I live just one more block over,"" she said. ""Thank you for a very  pleasant afternoon.""  <br><br>  Blinker muttered something and plunged northward till he found a  cab. A big, gray church loomed slowly at his right. Blinker shook  his fist at it through the window.  <br><br>  ""I gave you a thousand dollars last, week,"" he cried under his  breath, ""and she meets them in your very doors. There is something  wrong; there is something wrong.""  <br><br>  At eleven the next day Blinker signed his name thirty times with a  new pen provided by Lawyer Oldport.  <br><br>  ""Now let me go to the woods,"" he said surlily.  <br><br>  ""You are not looking well,"" said Lawyer Oldport. ""The trip will do  you good. But listen, if you will, to that little matter of business  of which I spoke to you yesterday, and also five years ago. There  are some buildings, fifteen in number, of which there are new  five-year leases to be signed. Your father contemplated a change in  the lease provisions, but never made it. He intended that the parlors  of these houses should not be sub-let, but that the tenants should be  allowed to use them for reception rooms. These houses are in the  shopping district, and are mainly tenanted by young working girls.  As it is they are forced to seek companionship outside. This row of  red brick--""  <br><br>  Blinker interrupted him with a loud, discordant laugh.  <br><br>  ""Brickdust Row for an even hundred,"" he cried. ""And I own it. Have I  guessed right?""  <br><br>  ""The tenants have some such name for it,"" said Lawyer Oldport.  <br><br>  Blinker arose and jammed his hat down to his eyes.  <br><br>  ""Do what you please with it,"" he said harshly. ""Remodel it, burn it,  raze it to the ground. But, man, it's too late I tell you. It's too  late. It's too late. It's too late.""                             <br><br>"
79,Buried Treasure,"There are many kinds of fools. Now, will everybody please sit still until they are called upon specifically to rise?<br><br>    I had been every kind of fool except one. I had expended my patrimony, pretended my matrimony, played poker, lawn-tennis, and bucket-shops--parted soon with my money in many ways. But there remained one rule of the wearer of cap and bells that I had not played. That was the Seeker after Buried Treasure. To few does the delectable furor come. But of all the would-be followers in the hoof- prints of King Midas none has found a pursuit so rich in pleasurable promise.<br><br>    But, going back from my theme a while--as lame pens must do--I was a fool of the sentimental soft. I saw May Martha Mangum, and was hers. She was eighteen, the color of the white ivory keys of a new piano, beautiful, and possessed by the exquisite solemnity and pathetic witchery of an unsophisticated angel doomed to live in a small, dull, Texas prairie-town. She had a spirit and charm that could have enabled her to pluck rubies like raspberries from the crown of Belgium or any other sporty kingdom, but she did not know it, and I did not paint the picture for her.<br><br>    You see, I wanted May Martha Mangum for to have and to hold. I wanted her to abide with me, and put my slippers and pipe away every day in places where they cannot be found of evenings.<br><br>    May Martha's father was a man hidden behind whiskers and spectacles. He lived for bugs and butterflies and all insects that fly or crawl or buzz or get down your back or in the butter. He was an etymologist, or words to that effect. He spent his life seining the air for flying fish of the June-bug order, and then sticking pins through 'em and calling 'em names.<br><br>    He and May Martha were the whole family. He prized her highly as a fine specimen of the racibus humanus because she saw that he had food at times, and put his clothes on right side before, and kept his alcohol-bottles filled. Scientists, they say, are apt to be absent- minded.<br><br>    There was another besides myself who thought May Martha Mangum one to be desired. That was Goodloe Banks, a young man just home from college. He had all the attainments to be found in books--Latin, Greek, philosophy, and especially the higher branches of mathematics and logic.<br><br>    If it hadn't been for his habit of pouring out this information and learning on every one that he addressed, I'd have liked him pretty well. But, even as it was, he and I were, you would have thought, great pals.<br><br>    We got together every time we could because each of us wanted to pump the other for whatever straws we could to find which way the wind blew from the heart of May Martha Mangum--rather a mixed metaphor; Goodloe Banks would never have been guilty of that. That is the way of rivals.<br><br>    You might say that Goodloe ran to books, manners, culture, rowing, intellect, and clothes. I would have put you in mind more of baseball and Friday-night debating societies--by way of culture--and maybe of a good horseback rider.<br><br>    But in our talks together, and in our visits and conversation with May Martha, neither Goodloe Banks nor I could find out which one of us she preferred. May Martha was a natural-born non-committal, and knew in her cradle how to keep people guessing.<br><br>    As I said, old man Mangum was absentminded. After a long time he found out one day--a little butterfly must have told him-that two young men were trying to throw a net over the head of the young person, a daughter, or some such technical appendage, who looked after his comforts.<br><br>    I never knew scientists could rise to such occasions. Old Mangum orally labelled and classified Goodloe and myself easily among the lowest orders of the vertebrates; and in English, too, without going any further into Latin than the simple references to Orgetorix, Rex Helvetii--which is as far as I ever went, myself. And he told us that if he ever caught us around his house again he would add us to his collection.<br><br>    Goodloe Banks and I remained away five days, expecting the storm to subside. When we dared to call at the house again May Martha Mangum and her father were gone. Gone! The house they had rented was closed. Their little store of goods and chattels was gone also.<br><br>    And not a word of farewell to either of us from May Martha--not a white, fluttering note pinned to the hawthorn-bush; not a chalk-mark on the gate-post nor a post-card in the post-office to give us a clew.<br><br>    For two months Goodloe Banks and I--separately--tried every scheme we could think of to track the runaways. We used our friendship and influence with the ticket-agent, with livery-stable men, railroad conductors, and our one lone, lorn constable, but without results.<br><br>    Then we became better friends and worse enemies than ever. We forgathered in the back room of Snyder's saloon every afternoon after work, and played dominoes, and laid conversational traps to find out from each other if anything had been discovered. That is the way of rivals.<br><br>    Now, Goodloe Banks had a sarcastic way of displaying his own learning and putting me in the class that was reading ""Poor Jane Ray, her bird is dead, she cannot play."" Well, I rather liked Goodloe, and I had a contempt for his college learning, and I was always regarded as good- natured, so I kept my temper. And I was trying to find out if he knew anything about May Martha, so I endured his society.<br><br>    In talking things over one afternoon he said to me:<br><br>    ""Suppose you do find her, Ed, whereby would you profit? Miss Mangum has a mind. Perhaps it is yet uncultured, but she is destined for higher things than you could give her. I have talked with no one who seemed to appreciate more the enchantment of the ancient poets and writers and the modern cults that have assimilated and expended their philosophy of life. Don't you think you are wasting your time looking for her?""<br><br>    ""My idea,"" said I, ""of a happy home is an eight-room house in a grove of live-oaks by the side of a charco on a Texas prairie. A piano,"" I went on, ""with an automatic player in the sitting-room, three thousand head of cattle under fence for a starter, a buckboard and ponies always hitched at a post for 'the missus '--and May Martha Mangum to spend the profits of the ranch as she pleases, and to abide with me, and put my slippers and pipe away every day in places where they cannot be found of evenings. That,"" said I, ""is what is to be; and a fig--a dried, Smyrna, dago-stand fig--for your curriculums, cults, and philosophy.""<br><br>    ""She is meant for higher things,"" repeated Goodloe Banks.<br><br>    ""Whatever she is meant for,"" I answered, just now she is out of pocket. And I shall find her as soon as I can without aid of the colleges.""<br><br>    ""The game is blocked,"" said Goodloe, putting down a domino and we had the beer.<br><br>    Shortly after that a young farmer whom I knew came into town and brought me a folded blue paper. He said his grandfather had just died. I concealed a tear, and he went on to say that the old man had jealously guarded this paper for twenty years. He left it to his family as part of his estate, the rest of which consisted of two mules and a hypotenuse of non-arable land.<br><br>    The sheet of paper was of the old, blue kind used during the rebellion of the abolitionists against the secessionists. It was dated June 14, 1863, and it described the hiding-place of ten burro-loads of gold and silver coin valued at three hundred thousand dollars. Old Rundle-- grandfather of his grandson, Sam--was given the information by a Spanish priest who was in on the treasure-burying, and who died many years before--no, afterward--in old Rundle's house. Old Rundle wrote it down from dictation.<br><br>    ""Why didn't your father look this up?"" I asked young Rundle.<br><br>    ""He went blind before he could do so,"" he replied.<br><br>    ""Why didn't you hunt for it yourself?"" I asked.<br><br>    ""Well,"" said he, ""I've only known about the paper for ten years. First there was the spring ploughin' to do, and then choppin' the weeds out of the corn; and then come takin' fodder; and mighty soon winter was on us. It seemed to run along that way year after year.""<br><br>    That sounded perfectly reasonable to me, so I took it up with young Lee Rundle at once.<br><br>    The directions on the paper were simple. The whole burro cavalcade laden with the treasure started from an old Spanish mission in Dolores County. They travelled due south by the compass until they reached the Alamito River. They forded this, and buried the treasure on the top of a little mountain shaped like a pack-saddle standing in a row between two higher ones. A heap of stones marked the place of the buried treasure. All the party except the Spanish priest were killed by Indians a few days later. The secret was a monopoly. It looked good to me.<br><br>    Lee Rundle suggested that we rig out a camping outfit, hire a surveyor to run out the line from the Spanish mission, and then spend the three hundred thousand dollars seeing the sights in Fort Worth. But, without being highly educated, I knew a way to save time and expense.<br><br>    We went to the State land-office and had a practical, what they call a ""working,"" sketch made of all the surveys of land from the old mission to the Alamito River. On this map I drew a line due southward to the river. The length of lines of each survey and section of land was accurately given on the sketch. By these we found the point on the river and had a ""connection"" made with it and an important, well- identified corner of the Los Animos five-league survey--a grant made by King Philip of Spain.<br><br>    By doing this we did not need to have the line run out by a surveyor. It was a great saving of expense and time.<br><br>    So, Lee Rundle and I fitted out a two-horse wagon team with all the accessories, and drove a hundred and forty-nine miles to Chico, the nearest town to the point we wished to reach. There we picked up a deputy county surveyor. He found the corner of the Los Animos survey for us, ran out the five thousand seven hundred and twenty varas west that our sketch called for, laid a stone on the spot, had coffee and bacon, and caught the mail-stage back to Chico.<br><br>    I was pretty sure we would get that three hundred thousand dollars. Lee Rundle's was to be only one-third, because I was paying all the expenses. With that two hundred thousand dollars I knew I could find May Martha Mangum if she was on earth. And with it I could flutter the butterflies in old man Mangum's dove-cot, too. If I could find that treasure!<br><br>    But Lee and I established camp. Across the river were a dozen little mountains densely covered by cedar-brakes, but not one shaped like a pack-saddle. That did not deter us. Appearances are deceptive. A pack-saddle, like beauty, may exist only in the eye of the beholder.<br><br>    I and the grandson of the treasure examined those cedar-covered hills with the care of a lady hunting for the wicked flea. We explored every side, top, circumference, mean elevation, angle, slope, and concavity of every one for two miles up and down the river. We spent four days doing so. Then we hitched up the roan and the dun, and hauled the remains of the coffee and bacon the one hundred and forty- nine miles back to Concho City.<br><br>    Lee Rundle chewed much tobacco on the return trip. I was busy driving, because I was in a hurry.<br><br>    As shortly as could be after our empty return Goodloe Banks and I forgathered in the back room of Snyder's saloon to play dominoes and fish for information. I told Goodloe about my expedition after the buried treasure.<br><br>    ""If I could have found that three hundred thousand dollars,"" I said to him, ""I could have scoured and sifted the surface of the earth to find May Martha Mangum.""<br><br>    ""She is meant for higher things,"" said Goodloe. ""I shall find her myself. But, tell me how you went about discovering the spot where this unearthed increment was imprudently buried.""<br><br>    I told him in the smallest detail. I showed him the draughtsman's sketch with the distances marked plainly upon it.<br><br>    After glancing over it in a masterly way, he leaned back in his chair and bestowed upon me an explosion of sardonic, superior, collegiate laughter.<br><br>    ""Well, you are a fool, Jim,"" he said, when he could speak.<br><br>    ""It's your play,"" said I, patiently, fingering my double-six.<br><br>    ""Twenty,"" said Goodloe, making two crosses on the table with his chalk.<br><br>    ""Why am I a fool?"" I asked. ""Buried treasure has been found before in many places.""<br><br>    ""Because,"" said he, ""in calculating the point on the river where your line would strike you neglected to allow for the variation. The variation there would be nine degrees west. Let me have your pencil.""<br><br>    Goodloe Banks figured rapidly on the back of an envelope.<br><br>    ""The distance, from north to south, of the line run from the Spanish mission,"" said he, ""is exactly twenty-two miles. It was run by a pocket-compass, according to your story. Allowing for the variation, the point on the Alamito River where you should have searched for your treasure is exactly six miles and nine hundred and forty-five varas farther west than the place you hit upon. Oh, what a fool you are, Jim!""<br><br>    ""What is this variation that you speak of?"" I asked. ""I thought figures never lied.""<br><br>    ""The variation of the magnetic compass,"" said Goodloe, ""from the true meridian.""<br><br>    He smiled in his superior way; and then I saw come out in his face the singular, eager, consuming cupidity of the seeker after buried treasure.<br><br>    ""Sometimes,"" he said with the air of the oracle, ""these old traditions of hidden money are not without foundation. Suppose you let me look over that paper describing the location. Perhaps together we might--""<br><br>    The result was that Goodloe Banks and I, rivals in love, became companions in adventure. We went to Chico by stage from Huntersburg, the nearest railroad town. In Chico we hired a team drawing a covered spring-wagon and camping paraphernalia. We had the same surveyor run out our distance, as revised by Goodloe and his variations, and then dismissed him and sent him on his homeward road.<br><br>    It was night when we arrived. I fed the horses and made a fire near the bank of the river and cooked supper. Goodloe would have helped, but his education had not fitted him for practical things.<br><br>    But while I worked he cheered me with the expression of great thoughts handed down from the dead ones of old. He quoted some translations from the Greek at much length.<br><br>    ""Anacreon,"" he explained. ""That was a favorite passage with Miss Mangum--as I recited it.""<br><br>    ""She is meant for higher things,"" said I, repeating his phrase.<br><br>    ""Can there be anything higher,"" asked Goodloe, ""than to dwell in the society of the classics, to live in the atmosphere of learning and culture? You have often decried education. What of your wasted efforts through your ignorance of simple mathematics? How soon would you have found your treasure if my knowledge had not shown you your error?""<br><br>    ""We'll take a look at those hills across the river first,"" said I, ""and see what we find. I am still doubtful about variations. I have been brought up to believe that the needle is true to the pole.""<br><br>    The next morning was a bright June one. We were up early and had breakfast. Goodloe was charmed. He recited--Keats, I think it was, and Kelly or Shelley--while I broiled the bacon. We were getting ready to cross the river, which was little more than a shallow creek there, and explore the many sharp-peaked cedar-covered hills on the other side.<br><br>    ""My good Ulysses,"" said Goodloe, slapping me on the shoulder while I was washing the tin breakfast-plates, ""let me see the enchanted document once more. I believe it gives directions for climbing the hill shaped like a pack-saddle. I never saw a pack-saddle. What is it like, Jim?""<br><br>    ""Score one against culture,"" said I. ""I'll know it when I see it.""<br><br>    Goodloe was looking at old Rundle's document when he ripped out a most uncollegiate swear-word.<br><br>    ""Come here,"" he said, holding the paper up against the sunlight. ""Look at that,"" he said, laying his finger against it.<br><br>    On the blue paper--a thing I had never noticed before--I saw stand out in white letters the word and figures : ""Malvern, 1898.""<br><br>    ""What about it?"" I asked.<br><br>    ""It's the water-mark,"" said Goodloe. ""The paper was manufactured in 1898. The writing on the paper is dated 1863. This is a palpable fraud.""<br><br>    ""Oh, I don't know,"" said I. ""The Rundles are pretty reliable, plain, uneducated country people. Maybe the paper manufacturers tried to perpetrate a swindle.""<br><br>    And then Goodloe Banks went as wild as his education permitted. He dropped the glasses off his nose and glared at me.<br><br>    ""I've often told you you were a fool,"" he said. ""You have let yourself be imposed upon by a clodhopper. And you have imposed upon me.""<br><br>    ""How,"" I asked, ""have I imposed upon you ?""<br><br>    ""By your ignorance,"" said he. ""Twice I have discovered serious flaws in your plans that a common-school education should have enabled you to avoid. And,"" he continued, ""I have been put to expense that I could ill afford in pursuing this swindling quest. I am done with it.""<br><br>    I rose and pointed a large pewter spoon at him, fresh from the dish- water.<br><br>    ""Goodloe Banks,"" I said, ""I care not one parboiled navy bean for your education. I always barely tolerated it in any one, and I despised it in you. What has your learning done for you? It is a curse to yourself and a bore to your friends. Away,"" I said--""away with your water-marks and variations! They are nothing to me. They shall not deflect me from the quest.""<br><br>    I pointed with my spoon across the river to a small mountain shaped like a pack-saddle.<br><br>    ""I am going to search that mountain,"" I went on, ""for the treasure. Decide now whether you are in it or not. If you wish to let a water- mark or a variation shake your soul, you are no true adventurer. Decide.""<br><br>    A white cloud of dust began to rise far down the river road. It was the mail-wagon from Hesperus to Chico. Goodloe flagged it.<br><br>    ""I am done with the swindle,"" said he, sourly. ""No one but a fool would pay any attention to that paper now. Well, you always were a fool, Jim. I leave you to your fate.""<br><br>    He gathered his personal traps, climbed into the mail-wagon, adjusted his glasses nervously, and flew away in a cloud of dust.<br><br>    After I had washed the dishes and staked the horses on new grass, I crossed the shallow river and made my way slowly through the cedar- brakes up to the top of the hill shaped like a pack-saddle.<br><br>    It was a wonderful June day. Never in my life had I seen so many birds, so many butter-flies, dragon-flies, grasshoppers, and such winged and stinged beasts of the air and fields.<br><br>    I investigated the hill shaped like a pack-saddle from base to summit. I found an absolute absence of signs relating to buried treasure. There was no pile of stones, no ancient blazes on the trees, none of the evidences of the three hundred thousand dollars, as set forth in the document of old man Rundle.<br><br>    I came down the hill in the cool of the afternoon. Suddenly, out of the cedar-brake I stepped into a beautiful green valley where a tributary small stream ran into the Alamito River.<br><br>    And there I was started to see what I took to be a wild man, with unkempt beard and ragged hair, pursuing a giant butterfly with brilliant wings.<br><br>    ""Perhaps he is an escaped madman,"" I thought; and wondered how he had strayed so far from seats of education and learning.<br><br>    And then I took a few more steps and saw a vine-covered cottage near the small stream. And in a little grassy glade I saw May Martha Mangum plucking wild flowers.<br><br>    She straightened up and looked at me. For the first time since I knew her I saw her face--which was the color of the white keys of a new piano--turn pink. I walked toward her without a word. She let the gathered flowers trickle slowly from her hand to the grass.<br><br>    ""I knew you would come, Jim,"" she said clearly. ""Father wouldn't let me write, but I knew you would come.<br><br>    What followed you may guess--there was my wagon and team just across the river.<br><br>    I've often wondered what good too much education is to a man if he can't use it for himself. If all the benefits of it are to go to others, where does it come in?<br><br>    For May Martha Mangum abides with me. There is an eight-room house in a live-oak grove, and a piano with an automatic player, and a good start toward the three thousand head of cattle is under fence.<br><br>    And when I ride home at night my pipe and slippers are put away in places where they cannot be found.<br><br>    But who cares for that? Who cares--who cares?                             <br><br>"
80,Confessions Of A Humorist,"There was a painless stage of incubation that lasted twenty-five years, and then it broke out on me, and people said I was It.<br><br>    But they called it humor instead of measles.<br><br>    The employees in the store bought a silver inkstand for the senior partner on his fiftieth birthday. We crowded into his private office to present it. I had been selected for spokesman, and I made a little speech that I had been preparing for a week.<br><br>    It made a hit. It was full of puns and epigrams and funny twists that brought down the house--which was a very solid one in the wholesale hardware line. Old Marlowe himself actually grinned, and the employees took their cue and roared.<br><br>    My reputation as a humorist dates from half-past nine o'clock on that morning. For weeks afterward my fellow clerks fanned the flame of my self-esteem. One by one they came to me, saying what an awfully clever speech that was, old man, and carefully explained to me the point of each one of my jokes.<br><br>    Gradually I found that I was expected to keep it up. Others might speak sanely on business matters and the day's topics, but from me something gamesome and airy was required.<br><br>    I was expected to crack jokes about the crockery and lighten up the granite ware with persiflage. I was second bookkeeper, and if I failed to show up a balance sheet without something comic about the footings or could find no cause for laughter in an invoice of plows, the other clerks were disappointed. By degrees my fame spread, and I became a local ""character."" Our town was small enough to make this possible. The daily newspaper quoted me. At social gatherings I was indispensable.<br><br>    I believe I did possess considerable wit and a facility for quick and spontaneous repartee. This gift I cultivated and improved by practice. And the nature of it was kindly and genial, not running to sarcasm or offending others. People began to smile when they saw me coming, and by the time we had met I generally had the word ready to broaden the smile into a laugh.<br><br>    I had married early. We had a charming boy of three and a girl of five. Naturally, we lived in a vine-covered cottage, and were happy. My salary as bookkeeper in the hardware concern kept at a distance those ills attendant upon superfluous wealth.<br><br>    At sundry times I had written out a few jokes and conceits that I considered peculiarly happy, and had sent them to certain periodicals that print such things. All of them had been instantly accepted. Several of the editors had written to request further contributions.<br><br>    One day I received a letter from the editor of a famous weekly publication. He suggested that I submit to him a humorous composition to fill a column of space; hinting that he would make it a regular feature of each issue if the work proved satisfactory. I did so, and at the end of two weeks he offered to make a contract with me for a year at a figure that was considerably higher than the amount paid me by the hardware firm.<br><br>    I was filled with delight. My wife already crowned me in her mind with the imperishable evergreens of literary success. We had lobster croquettes and a bottle of blackberry wine for supper that night. Here was the chance to liberate myself from drudgery. I talked over the matter very seriously with Louisa. We agreed that I must resign my place at the store and devote myself to humor.<br><br>    I resigned. My fellow clerks gave me a farewell banquet. The speech I made there coruscated. It was printed in full by the Gazette. The next morning I awoke and looked at the clock.<br><br>    ""Late, by George!"" I exclaimed, and grabbed for my clothes. Louisa reminded me that I was no longer a slave to hardware and contractors' supplies. I was now a professional humorist.<br><br>    After breakfast she proudly led me to the little room off the kitchen. Dear girl! There was my table and chair, writing pad, ink, and pipe tray. And all the author's trappings--the celery stand full of fresh roses and honeysuckle, last year's calendar on the wall, the dictionary, and a little bag of chocolates to nibble between inspirations. Dear girl!<br><br>    I sat me to work. The wall paper is patterned with arabesques or odalisks or--perhaps--it is trapezoids. Upon one of the figures I fixed my eyes. I bethought me of humor.<br><br>    A voice startled me--Louisa's voice.<br><br>    ""If you aren't too busy, dear,"" it said, ""come to dinner.""<br><br>    I looked at my watch. Yes, five hours had been gathered in by the grim scytheman. I went to dinner.<br><br>    ""You mustn't work too hard at first,"" said Louisa. ""Goethe--or was it Napoleon?--said five hours a day is enough for mental labor. Couldn't you take me and the children to the woods this afternoon?""<br><br>    ""I am a little tired,"" I admitted. So we went to the woods.<br><br>    But I soon got the swing of it. Within a month I was turning out copy as regular as shipments of hardware.<br><br>    And I had success. My column in the weekly made some stir, and I was referred to in a gossipy way by the critics as something fresh in the line of humorists. I augmented my income considerably by contributing to other publications.<br><br>    I picked up the tricks of the trade. I could take a funny idea and make a two-line joke of it, earning a dollar. With false whiskers on, it would serve up cold as a quatrain, doubling its producing value. By turning the skirt and adding a ruffle of rhyme you would hardly recognize it as vers de societe with neatly shod feet and a fashion-plate illustration.<br><br>    I began to save up money, and we had new carpets, and a parlor organ. My townspeople began to look upon me as a citizen of some consequence instead of the merry trifier I had been when I clerked in the hardware store.<br><br>    After five or six months the spontaniety seemed to depart from my humor. Quips and droll sayings no longer fell carelessly from my lips. I was sometimes hard run for material. I found myself listening to catch available ideas from the conversation of my friends. Sometimes I chewed my pencil and gazed at the wall paper for hours trying to build up some gay little bubble of unstudied fun.<br><br>    And then I became a harpy, a Moloch, a Jonah, a vampire, to my acquaintances. Anxious, haggard, greedy, I stood among them like a veritable killjoy. Let a bright saying, a witty comparison, a piquant phrase fall from their lips and I was after it like a hound springing upon a bone. I dared not trust my memory; but, turning aside guiltily and meanly, I would make a note of it in my ever-present memorandum book or upon my cuff for my own future use.<br><br>    My friends regarded me in sorrow and wonder. I was not the same man. Where once I had furnished them entertainment and jollity, I now preyed upon them. No jests from me ever bid for their smiles now. They were too precious. I could not afford to dispense gratuitously the means of my livelihood.<br><br>    I was a lugubrious fox praising the singing of my friends, the crow's, that they might drop from their beaks the morsels of wit that I coveted.<br><br>    Nearly every one began to avoid me. I even forgot how to smile, not even paying that much for the sayings I appropriated.<br><br>    No persons, places, times, or subjects were exempt from my plundering in search of material. Even in church my demoralized fancy went hunting among the solemn aisles and pillars for spoil.<br><br>    Did the minister give out the long-meter doxology, at once I began: ""Doxology --sockdology--sockdolager--meter--meet her.""<br><br>    The sermon ran through my mental sieve, its precepts filtering unheeded, could I but glean a suggestion of a pun or a bon mot. The solemnest anthems of the choir were but an accompaniment to my thoughts as I conceived new changes to ring upon the ancient comicalities concerning the jealousies of soprano, tenor, and basso.<br><br>    My own home became a hunting ground. My wife is a singularly feminine creature, candid, sympathetic, and impulsive. Once her conversation was my delight, and her ideas a source of unfailing pleasure. Now I worked her. She was a gold mine of those amusing but lovable inconsistencies that distinguish the female mind.<br><br>    I began to market those pearls of unwisdom and humor that should have enriched only the sacred precincts of home. With devilish cunning I encouraged her to talk. Unsuspecting, she laid her heart bare. Upon the cold, conspicuous, common, printed page I offered it to the public gaze.<br><br>    A literary Judas, I kissed her and betrayed her. For pieces of silver I dressed her sweet confidences in the pantalettes and frills of folly and made them dance in the market place.<br><br>    Dear Louisa! Of nights I have bent over her cruel as a wolf above a tender lamb, hearkening even to her soft words murmured in sleep, hoping to catch an idea for my next day's grind. There is worse to come.<br><br>    God help me! Next my fangs were buried deep in the neck of the fugitive sayings of my little children.<br><br>    Guy and Viola were two bright fountains of childish, quaint thoughts and speeches. I found a ready sale for this kind of humor, and was furnishing a regular department in a magazine with ""Funny Fancies of Childhood."" I began to stalk them as an Indian stalks the antelope. I would hide behind sofas and doors, or crawl on my hands and knees among the bushes in the yard to eavesdrop while they were at play. I had all the qualities of a harpy except remorse.<br><br>    Once, when I was barren of ideas, and my copy must leave in the next mail, I covered myself in a pile of autumn leaves in the yard, where I knew they intended to come to play. I cannot bring myself to believe that Guy was aware of my hiding place, but even if he was, I would be loath to blame him for his setting fire to the leaves, causing the destruction of my new suit of clothes, and nearly cremating a parent.<br><br>    Soon my own children began to shun me as a pest. Often, when I was creeping upon them like a melancholy ghoul, I would hear them say to each other: ""Here comes papa,"" and they would gather their toys and scurry away to some safer hiding place. Miserable wretch that I was!<br><br>    And yet I was doing well financially. Before the first year had passed I had saved a thousand dollars, and we had lived in comfort.<br><br>    But at what a cost! I am not quite clear as to what a pariah is, but I was everything that it sounds like. I had no friends, no amusements, no enjoyment of life. The happiness of my family had been sacrificed. I was a bee, sucking sordid honey from life's fairest flowers, dreaded and shunned on account of my stingo.<br><br>    One day a man spoke to me, with a pleasant and friendly smile. Not in months had the thing happened. I was passing the undertaking establishment of Peter Heffelbower. Peter stood in the door and saluted me. I stopped, strangely wrung in my heart by his greeting. He asked me inside.<br><br>    The day was chill and rainy. We went into the back room, where a fire burned, in a little stove. A customer came, and Peter left me alone for a while. Presently I felt a new feeling stealing over me --a sense of beautiful calm and content, I looked around the place. There were rows of shining rosewood caskets, black palls, trestles, hearse plumes, mourning streamers, and all the paraphernalia of the solemn trade. Here was peace, order, silence, the abode of grave and dignified reflections. Here, on the brink of life, was a little niche pervaded by the spirit of eternal rest.<br><br>    When I entered it, the follies of the world abandoned me at the door. I felt no inclination to wrest a humorous idea from those sombre and stately trappings. My mind seemed to stretch itself to grateful repose upon a couch draped with gentle thoughts.<br><br>    A quarter of an hour ago I was an abandoned humorist. Now I was a philosopher, full of serenity and ease. I had found a refuge from humor, from the hot chase of the shy quip, from the degrading pursuit of the panting joke, from the restless reach after the nimble repartee.<br><br>    I had not known Heffelbower well. When he came back, I let him talk, fearful that he might prove to be a jarring note in the sweet, dirgelike harmony of his establishment.<br><br>    But, no. He chimed truly. I gave a long sigh of happiness. Never have I known a man's talk to be as magnificently dull as Peter's was. Compared with it the Dead Sea is a geyser. Never a sparkle or a glimmer of wit marred his words. Commonplaces as trite and as plentiful as blackberries flowed from his lips no more stirring in quality than a last week's tape running from a ticker. Quaking a little, I tried upon him one of my best pointed jokes. It fell back ineffectual, with the point broken. I loved that man from then on.<br><br>    Two or three evenings each week I would steal down to Heffelbower's and revel in his back room. That was my only joy. I began to rise early and hurry through my work, that I might spend more time in my haven. In no other place could I throw off my habit of extracting humorous ideas from my surroundings. Peter's talk left me no opening had I besieged it ever so hard.<br><br>    Under this influence I began to improve in spirits. It was the recreation from one's labor which every man needs. I surprised one or two of my former friends by throwing them a smile and a cheery word as I passed them on the streets. Several times I dumfounded my family by relaxing long enough to make a jocose remark in their presence.<br><br>    I had so long been ridden by the incubus of humor that I seized my hours of holiday with a schoolboy's zest.<br><br>    Mv work began to suffer. It was not the pain and burden to me that it had been. I often whistled at my desk, and wrote with far more fluency than before. I accomplished my tasks impatiently, as anxious to be off to my helpful retreat as a drunkard is to get to his tavern.<br><br>    My wife had some anxious hours in conjecturing where I spent my afternoons. I thought it best not to tell her; women do not understand these things. Poor girl!--she had one shock out of it.<br><br>    One day I brought home a silver coffin handle for a paper weight and a fine, fluffy hearse plume to dust my papers with.<br><br>    I loved to see them on my desk, and think of the beloved back room down at Heffelbower's. But Louisa found them, and she shrieked with horror. I had to console her with some lame excuse for having them, but I saw in her eyes that the prejudice was not removed. I had to remove the articles, though, at double-quick time.<br><br>    One day Peter Heffelbower laid before me a temptation that swept me off my feet. In his sensible, uninspired way he showed me his books, and explained that his profits and his business were increasing rapidly. He had thought of taking in a partner with some cash. He would rather have me than any one he knew. When I left his place that afternoon Peter had my check for the thousand dollars I had in the bank, and I was a partner in his undertaking business.<br><br>    I went home with feelings of delirious joy, mingled with a certain amount of doubt. I was dreading to tell my wife about it. But I walked on air. To give up the writing of humorous stuff, once more to enjoy the apples of life, instead of squeezing them to a pulp for a few drops of hard cider to make the pubic feel funny--what a boon that would be!<br><br>    At the supper table Louisa handed me some letters that had come during my absence. Several of them contained rejected manuscript. Ever since I first began going to Heffelbower's my stuff had been coming back with alarming frequency. Lately I had been dashing off my jokes and articles with the greatest fluency. Previously I had labored like a bricklayer, slowly and with agony.<br><br>    Presently I opened a letter from the editor of the weekly with which I had a regular contract. The checks for that weekly article were still our main dependence. The letter ran thus:<br><br>    DEAR SIR:  As you are aware, our contract for the year expires with the present  month. While regretting the necessity for so doing, we must say that  we do not care to renew same for the coming year. We were quite  pleased with your style of humor, which seems to have delighted quite  a large proportion of our readers. But for the past two months we  have noticed a decided falling off in its quality. Your earlier work  showed a spontaneous, easy, natural flow of fun and wit. Of late it  is labored, studied, and unconvincing, giving painful evidence of hard  toil and drudging mechanism.  Again regretting that we do not consider your contributions  available any longer, we are, yours sincerely,  THE EDITOR.  I handed this letter to my wife. After she had read it her face grew extremely long, and there were tears in her eyes.<br><br>    ""The mean old thing!"" she exclaimed indignantly. ""I'm sure your pieces are just as good as they ever were. And it doesn't take you half as long to write them as it did."" And then, I suppose, Louisa thought of the checks that would cease coming. ""Oh, John,"" she wailed, ""what will you do now?""<br><br>    For an answer I got up and began to do a polka step around the supper table. I am sure Louisa thought the trouble had driven me mad; and I think the children hoped it had, for they tore after me, yelling with glee and emulating my steps. I was now something like their old playmate as of yore.<br><br>    ""The theatre for us to-night!"" I shouted; ""nothing less. And a late, wild, disreputable supper for all of us at the Palace Restaurant. Lumpty-diddle-de-dee-de-dum!""<br><br>    And then I explained my glee by declaring that I was now a partner in a prosperous undertaking establishment, and that written jokes might go hide their heads in sackcloth and ashes for all me.<br><br>    With the editor's letter in her hand to justify the deed I had done, my wife could advance no objections save a few mild ones based on the feminine inability to appreciate a good thing such as the little back room of Peter Hef--no, of Heffelbower & Co's. undertaking establishment.<br><br>    In conclusion, I will say that to-day you will find no man in our town as well liked, as jovial, and full of merry sayings as I. My jokes are again noised about and quoted; once more I take pleasure in my wife's confidential chatter without a mercenary thought, while Guy and Viola play at my feet distributing gems of childish humor without fear of the ghastly tormentor who used to dog their steps, notebook in hand.<br><br>    Our business has prospered finely. I keep the books and look after the shop, while Peter attends to outside matters. He says that my levity and high spirits would simply turn any funeral into a regular Irish wake.                             <br><br>"
81,"""Girl""","IN GILT letters on the ground glass of the door of room No. 962 were the words: ""Robbins & Hartley, Brokers."" The clerks had gone. It was past five, and with the solid tramp of a drove of prize Percherons, scrub- women were invading the cloud-capped twenty-story office building. A puff of red-hot air flavoured with lemon peelings, soft-coal smoke and train oil came in through the half-open windows.<br><br>    Robbins, fifty, something of an overweight beau, and addicted to first nights and hotel palm-rooms, pretended to be envious of his partner's commuter's joys.<br><br>    ""Going to be something doing in the humidity line to-night,"" he said. ""You out-of-town chaps will be the people, with your katydids and moonlight and long drinks and things out on the front porch.""<br><br>    Hartley, twenty-nine, serious, thin, good-looking, ner- vous, sighed and frowned a little.<br><br>    ""Yes,"" said he, ""we always have cool nights in Floral- hurst, especially in the winter.""<br><br>    A man with an air of mystery came in the door and went up to Hartley.<br><br>    ""I've found where she lives,"" he announced in the portentous half-whisper that makes the detective at work a marked being to his fellow men.<br><br>    Hartley scowled him into a state of dramatic silence and quietude. But by that time Robbins had got his cane and set his tie pin to his liking, and with a debonair nod went out to his metropolitan amusements.<br><br>    ""Here is the address,"" said the detective in a natural tone, being deprived of an audience to foil.<br><br>    Hartley took the leaf torn out of the sleuth's dingy memorandum book. On it were pencilled the words ""Vivienne Arlington, No. 341 East --th Street, care of Mrs. McComus.""<br><br>    ""Moved there a week ago,"" said the detective. ""Now, if you want any shadowing done, Mr. Hartley, I can do you as fine a job in that line as anybody in the city. It will be only $7 a day and expenses. Can send in a daily typewritten report, covering -- ""<br><br>    ""You needn't go on,"" interrupted the broker. ""It isn't a case of that kind. I merely wanted the address. How much shall I pay you?""<br><br>    ""One day's work,"" said the sleuth. ""A tenner will cover it.""<br><br>    Hartley paid the man and dismissed him. Then he left the office and boarded a Broadway car. At the first large crosstown artery of travel he took an eastbound car that deposited him in a decaying avenue, whose ancient structures once sheltered the pride and glory of the town.<br><br>    Walking a few squares, he came to the building that he sought. It was a new flathouse, bearing carved upon its cheap stone portal its sonorous name, ""The Vallambrosa."" Fire-escapes zigzagged down its front -- these laden with household goods, drying clothes, and squalling children evicted by the midsummer heat. Here and there a pale rubber plant peeped from the miscellaneous mass, as if wondering to what kingdom it belonged -- vegetable, animal or artificial.<br><br>    Hartley pressed the ""McComus"" button. The door latch clicked spasmodically -- now hospitably, now doubt- fully, as though in anxiety whether it might be admitting friends or duns. Hartley entered and began to climb the stairs after the manner of those who seek their friends in city flat-houses -- which is the manner of a boy who climbs an apple-tree, stopping when he comes upon what he wants.<br><br>    On the fourth floor he saw Vivienne standing in an open door. She invited him inside, with a nod and a bright, genuine smile. She placed a chair for him near a window, and poised herself gracefully upon the edge of one of those Jekyll-and-Hyde pieces of furniture that are masked and mysteriously hooded, unguessable bulks by day and inquisitorial racks of torture by night.<br><br>    Hartley cast a quick, critical, appreciative glance at her before speaking, and told himself that his taste in choosing had been flawless.<br><br>    Vivienne was about twenty-one. She was of the purest Saxon type. Her hair was a ruddy golden, each filament of the neatly gathered mass shining with its own lustre and delicate graduation of colour. In perfect harmony were her ivory-clear complexion and deep sea-blue eyes that looked upon the world with the ingenuous calmness of a mermaid or the pixie of an undiscovered mountain stream. Her frame was strong and yet possessed the grace of absolute naturalness. And yet with all her North- ern clearness and frankness of line and colouring, there seemed to be something of the tropics in her -- something of languor in the droop of her pose, of love of ease in her ingenious complacency of satisfaction and comfort in the mere act of breathing -- something that seemed to claim for her a right as a perfect work of nature to exist and be admired equally with a rare flower or some beauti- ful, milk-white dove among its sober-hued companions.<br><br>    She was dressed in a white waist and dark skirt - that discreet masquerade of goose-girl and duchess.<br><br>    ""Vivienne,"" said Hartley, looking at her pleadingly, ""you did not answer my last letter. It was only by nearly a week's search that I found where you had moved to. Why have you kept me in suspense when you knew how anxiously I was waiting to see you and hear from you?""<br><br>    The girl looked out the window dreamily.<br><br>    ""Mr. Hartley,"" she said hesitatingly, ""I hardly know what to say to you. I realize all the advantages of your offer, and sometimes I feel sure that I could be contented with you. But, again, I am doubtful. I was born a city girl, and I am afraid to bind myself to a quiet sub- urban life.""<br><br>    ""My dear girl,"" said Hartley, ardently, ""have I not told you that you shall have everything that your heart can desire that is in my power to give you? You shall come to the city for the theatres, for shopping and to visit your friends as often as you care to. You can trust me, can you not?""<br><br>    ""To the fullest,"" she said, turning her frank eyes upon him with a smile. ""I know you are the kindest of men, and that the girl you get will be a lucky one. I learned all about you when I was at the Montgomerys'.""<br><br>    ""Ah!"" exclaimed Hartley, with a tender, reminiscent light in his eye; ""I remember well the evening I first saw you at the Montgomerys'. Mrs. Montgomery was sound- ing your praises to me all the evening. And she hardly did you justice. I shall never forget that supper. Come, Vivienne, promise me. I want you. You'll never regret coming with me. No one else will ever give you as pleasant a home.""<br><br>    The girl sighed and looked down at her folded hands.<br><br>    A sudden jealous suspicion seized Hartley.<br><br>    ""Tell me, Vivienne,"" he asked, regarding her keenly, ""is there another -- is there some one else ?""<br><br>    A rosy flush crept slowly over her fair cheeks and neck.<br><br>    ""You shouldn't ask that, Mr. Hartley,"" she said, in some confusion. ""But I will tell you. There is one other -- but he has no right -- I have promised him nothing.""<br><br>    ""His name?"" demanded Hartley, sternly.<br><br>    ""Townsend.""<br><br>    ""Rafford Townsend!"" exclaimed Hartley, with a grim tightening of his jaw. ""How did that man come to know you? After all I've done for him -- ""<br><br>    ""His auto has just stopped below,"" said Vivienne, bending over the window-sill. ""He's coming for his answer. Oh I don't know what to do!""<br><br>    The bell in the flat kitchen whirred. Vivienne hurried to press the latch button.<br><br>    ""Stay here,"" said Hartley. ""I will meet him in the hall.""<br><br>    Townsend, looking like a Spanish grandee in his light tweeds, Panama hat and curling black mustache, came up the stairs three at a time. He stopped at sight of Hartley and looked foolish.<br><br>    ""Go back,"" said Hartley, firmly, pointing downstairs with his forefinger.<br><br>    ""Hullo!"" said Townsend, feigning surprise. ""What's up? What are you doing here, old man?""<br><br>    ""Go back,"" repeated Hartley, inflexibly. ""The Law of the Jungle. Do you want the Pack to tear you in pieces? The kill is mine.""<br><br>    ""I came here to see a plumber about the bathroom connections,"" said Townsend, bravely.<br><br>    ""All right,"" said Hartley. ""You shall have that lying plaster to stick upon your traitorous soul. But, go back."" Townsend went downstairs, leaving a bitter word to be wafted up the draught of the staircase. Hartley went back to his wooing.<br><br>    ""Vivienne,"" said he, masterfully. ""I have got to have you. I will take no more refusals or dilly-dallying.""<br><br>    ""When do you want me?"" she asked.<br><br>    ""Now. As soon as you can get ready.""<br><br>    She stood calmly before him and looked him in the eye.<br><br>    ""Do you think for one moment,"" she said, ""that I would enter your home while Hloise is there?""<br><br>    Hartley cringed as if from an unexpected blow. He folded his arms and paced the carpet once or twice.<br><br>    ""She shall go,"" he declared grimly. Drops stood upon his brow. ""Why should I let that woman make my life miserable? Never have I seen one day of freedom from trouble since I have known her. You are right, Vivienne. Hloise must be sent away before I can take you home. But she shall go. I have decided. I will turn her from my doors.""<br><br>    ""When will you do this?"" asked the girl.<br><br>    Hartley clinched his teeth and bent his brows together.<br><br>    ""To-night,"" he said, resolutely. ""I will send her away to-night.""<br><br>    ""Then,"" said Vivienne, ""my answer is 'yes.' Come for me when you will.""<br><br>    She looked into his eyes with a sweet, sincere light in her own. Hartley could scarcely believe that her sur- render was true, it was so swift and complete.<br><br>    ""Promise me,"" he said feelingly, ""on your word and honour.""<br><br>    ""On my word and honour,"" repeated Vivienne, softly.<br><br>    At the door he turned and gazed at her happily, but yet as one who scarcely trusts the foundations of his joy.<br><br>    ""To-morrow,"" he said, with a forefinger of reminder uplifted.<br><br>    ""To-morrow,"" she repeated with a smile of truth and candour.<br><br>    In an hour and forty minutes Hartley stepped off the train at Floralhurst. A brisk walk of ten minutes brought him to the gate of a handsome two-story cottage set upon a wide and well-tended lawn. Halfway to the house he was met by a woman with jet-black braided hair and flowing white summer gown, who half strangled him without apparent cause.<br><br>    When they stepped into the hall she said:<br><br>    ""Mamma's here. The auto is coming for her in half an hour. She came to dinner, but there's no dinner.""<br><br>    ""I've something to tell you,"" said Hartley. ""I thought to break it to you gently, but since your mother is here we may as well out with it.""<br><br>    He stooped and whispered something at her ear.<br><br>    His wife screamed. Her mother came running into the hall. The dark-haired woman screamed again- the joyful scream of a well-beloved and petted woman.<br><br>    ""Oh, mamma!"" she cried ecstatically, ""what do you think? Vivienne is coming to cook for us! She is the one that stayed with the Montgomerys a whole year. And now, Billy, dear,"" she concluded, ""you must go right down into the kitchen and discharge Hloise. She has been drunk again the whole day long.""                             <br><br>"
82,Hearts And Hands,"At Denver there was an influx of passengers into the coaches on the eastbound B. & M. express. In one coach there sat a very pretty young woman dressed in elegant taste and surrounded by all the luxurious comforts of an experienced traveler. Among the newcomers were two young men, one of handsome presence with a bold, frank countenance and manner; the other a ruffled, glum-faced person, heavily built and roughly dressed. The two were handcuffed together.<br><br>    As they passed down the aisle of the coach the only vacant seat offered was a reversed one facing the attractive young woman. Here the linked couple seated themselves. The young woman's glance fell upon them with a distant, swift disinterest; then with a lovely smile brightening her countenance and a tender pink tingeing her rounded cheeks, she held out a little gray-gloved hand. When she spoke her voice, full, sweet, and deliberate, proclaimed that its owner was accustomed to speak and be heard.<br><br>    ""Well, Mr. Easton, if you will make me speak first, I suppose I must. Don't you ever recognize old friends when you meet them in the West?""<br><br>    The younger man roused himself sharply at the sound of her voice, seemed to struggle with a slight embarrassment which he threw off instantly, and then clasped her fingers with his left hand.<br><br>    ""It's Miss Fairchild,"" he said, with a smile. ""I'll ask you to excuse the other hand; ""it's otherwise engaged just at present.""<br><br>    He slightly raised his right hand, bound at the wrist by the shining ""bracelet"" to the left one of his companion. The glad look in the girl's eyes slowly changed to a bewildered horror. The glow faded from her cheeks. Her lips parted in a vague, relaxing distress. Easton, with a little laugh, as if amused, was about to speak again when the other forestalled him. The glum-faced man had been watching the girl's countenance with veiled glances from his keen, shrewd eyes.<br><br>    ""You'll excuse me for speaking, miss, but, I see you're acquainted with the marshall here. If you'll ask him to speak a word for me when we get to the pen he'll do it, and it'll make things easier for me there. He's taking me to Leavenworth prison. It's seven years for counterfeiting.""<br><br>    ""Oh!"" said the girl, with a deep breath and returning color. ""So that is what you are doing out here? A marshal!""<br><br>    ""My dear Miss Fairchild,"" said Easton, calmly, ""I had to do something. Money has a way of taking wings unto itself, and you know it takes money to keep step with our crowd in Washington. I saw this opening in the West, and--well, a marshalship isn't quite as high a position as that of ambassador, but--""<br><br>    ""The ambassador,"" said the girl, warmly, ""doesn't call any more. He needn't ever have done so. You ought to know that. And so now you are one of these dashing Western heroes, and you ride and shoot and go into all kinds of dangers. That's different from the Washington life. You have been missed from the old crowd.""<br><br>    The girl's eyes, fascinated, went back, widening a little, to rest upon the glittering handcuffs.<br><br>    ""Don't you worry about them, miss,"" said the other man. ""All marshals handcuff themselves to their prisoners to keep them from getting away. Mr. Easton knows his business.""<br><br>    ""Will we see you again soon in Washington?"" asked the girl.<br><br>    ""Not soon, I think,"" said Easton. ""My butterfly days are over, I fear.""<br><br>    ""I love the West,"" said the girl irrelevantly. Her eyes were shining softly. She looked away out the car window. She began to speak truly and simply without the gloss of style and manner: ""Mamma and I spent the summer in Denver. She went home a week ago because father was slightly ill. I could live and be happy in the West. I think the air here agrees with me. Money isn't everything. But people always misunderstand things and remain stupid--""<br><br>    ""Say, Mr. Marshal,"" growled the glum-faced man. ""This isn't quite fair. I'm needing a drink, and haven't had a smoke all day. Haven't you talked long enough? Take me in the smoker now, won't you? I'm half dead for a pipe.""<br><br>    The bound travelers rose to their feet, Easton with the same slow smile on his face.<br><br>    ""I can't deny a petition for tobacco,"" he said, lightly. ""It's the one friend of the unfortunate. Good-bye, Miss Fairchild. Duty calls, you know."" He held out his hand for a farewell.<br><br>    ""It's too bad you are not going East,"" she said, reclothing herself with manner and style. ""But you must go on to Leavenworth, I suppose?""<br><br>    ""Yes,"" said Easton, ""I must go on to Leavenworth.""<br><br>    The two men sidled down the aisle into the smoker.<br><br>    The two passengers in a seat near by had heard most of the conversation. Said one of them: ""That marshal's a good sort of chap. Some of these Western fellows are all right.""<br><br>    ""Pretty young to hold an office like that, isn't he?"" asked the other.<br><br>    ""Young!"" exclaimed the first speaker, ""why--Oh! didn't you catch on? Say--did you ever know an officer to handcuff a prisoner to his right hand?""                             <br><br>"
83,Springtime A La Carte,"  It was a day in March.  <br><br>  Never, never begin a story this way when you write one. No opening could possibly be worse. It is unimaginative, flat, dry and likely to consist of mere wind. But in this instance it is allowable. For the following paragraph, which should have inaugurated the narrative, is too wildly extravagant and preposterous to be flaunted in the face of the reader without preparation.  <br><br>  Sarah was crying over her bill of fare.  <br><br>  Think of a New York girl shedding tears on the menu card!  <br><br>  To account for this you will be allowed to guess that the lobsters were all out, or that she had sworn ice-cream off during Lent, or that she had ordered onions, or that she had just come from a Hackett matinee. And then, all these theories being wrong, you will please let the story proceed.  <br><br>  The gentleman who announced that the world was an oyster which he with his sword would open made a larger hit than he deserved. It is not difficult to open an oyster with a sword. But did you ever notice any one try to open the terrestrial bivalve with a typewriter? Like to wait for a dozen raw opened that way?  <br><br>  Sarah had managed to pry apart the shells with her unhandy weapon far enough to nibble a wee bit at the cold and clammy world within. She knew no more shorthand than if she had been a graduate in stenography just let slip upon the world by a business college. So, not being able to stenog, she could not enter that bright galaxy of office talent. She was a free-lance typewriter and canvassed for odd jobs of copying.  <br><br>  The most brilliant and crowning feat of Sarah's battle with the world was the deal she made with Schulenberg's Home Restaurant. The restaurant was next door to the old red brick in which she ball- roomed. One evening after dining at Schulenberg's 40-cent, five- course table d'hote (served as fast as you throw the five baseballs at the coloured gentleman's head) Sarah took away with her the bill of fare. It was written in an almost unreadable script neither English nor German, and so arranged that if you were not careful you began with a toothpick and rice pudding and ended with soup and the day of the week.  <br><br>  The next day Sarah showed Schulenberg a neat card on which the menu was beautifully typewritten with the viands temptingly marshalled under their right and proper heads from ""hors d'oeuvre"" to ""not responsible for overcoats and umbrellas.""  <br><br>  Schulenberg became a naturalised citizen on the spot. Before Sarah left him she had him willingly committed to an agreement. She was to furnish typewritten bills of fare for the twenty-one tables in the restaurant--a new bill for each day's dinner, and new ones for breakfast and lunch as often as changes occurred in the food or as neatness required.  <br><br>  In return for this Schulenberg was to send three meals per diem to Sarah's hall room by a waiter--an obsequious one if possible--and furnish her each afternoon with a pencil draft of what Fate had in store for Schulenberg's customers on the morrow.  <br><br>  Mutual satisfaction resulted from the agreement. Schulenberg's patrons now knew what the food they ate was called even if its nature sometimes puzzled them. And Sarah had food during a cold, dull winter, which was the main thing with her.  <br><br>  And then the almanac lied, and said that spring had come. Spring comes when it comes. The frozen snows of January still lay like adamant in the crosstown streets. The hand-organs still played ""In the Good Old Summertime,"" with their December vivacity and expression. Men began to make thirty-day notes to buy Easter dresses. Janitors shut off steam. And when these things happen one may know that the city is still in the clutches of winter.  <br><br>  One afternoon Sarah shivered in her elegant hall bedroom; ""house heated; scrupulously clean; conveniences; seen to be appreciated."" She had no work to do except Schulenberg's menu cards. Sarah sat in her squeaky willow rocker, and looked out the window. The calendar on the wall kept crying to her: ""Springtime is here, Sarah-- springtime is here, I tell you. Look at me, Sarah, my figures show it. You've got a neat figure yourself, Sarah--a--nice springtime figure--why do you look out the window so sadly?""  <br><br>  Sarah's room was at the back of the house. Looking out the window she could see the windowless rear brick wall of the box factory on the next street. But the wall was clearest crystal; and Sarah was looking down a grassy lane shaded with cherry trees and elms and bordered with raspberry bushes and Cherokee roses.  <br><br>  Spring's real harbingers are too subtle for the eye and ear. Some must have the flowering crocus, the wood-starring dogwood, the voice of bluebird--even so gross a reminder as the farewell handshake of the retiring buckwheat and oyster before they can welcome the Lady in Green to their dull bosoms. But to old earth's choicest kin there come straight, sweet messages from his newest bride, telling them they shall be no stepchildren unless they choose to be.  <br><br>  On the previous summer Sarah had gone into the country and loved a farmer.  <br><br>  (In writing your story never hark back thus. It is bad art, and cripples interest. Let it march, march.)  <br><br>  Sarah stayed two weeks at Sunnybrook Farm. There she learned to love old Farmer Franklin's son Walter. Farmers have been loved and wedded and turned out to grass in less time. But young Walter Franklin was a modern agriculturist. He had a telephone in his cow house, and he could figure up exactly what effect next year's Canada wheat crop would have on potatoes planted in the dark of the moon.  <br><br>  It was in this shaded and raspberried lane that Walter had wooed and won her. And together they had sat and woven a crown of dandelions for her hair. He had immoderately praised the effect of the yellow blossoms against her brown tresses; and she had left the chaplet there, and walked back to the house swinging her straw sailor in her hands.  <br><br>  They were to marry in the spring--at the very first signs of spring, Walter said. And Sarah came back to the city to pound her typewriter.  <br><br>  A knock at the door dispelled Sarah's visions of that happy day. A waiter had brought the rough pencil draft of the Home Restaurant's next day fare in old Schulenberg's angular hand.  <br><br>  Sarah sat down to her typewriter and slipped a card between the rollers. She was a nimble worker. Generally in an hour and a half the twenty-one menu cards were written and ready.  <br><br>  To-day there were more changes on the bill of fare than usual. The soups were lighter; pork was eliminated from the entrees, figuring only with Russian turnips among the roasts. The gracious spirit of spring pervaded the entire menu. Lamb, that lately capered on the greening hillsides, was becoming exploited with the sauce that commemorated its gambols. The song of the oyster, though not silenced, was diminuendo con amore. The frying-pan seemed to be held, inactive, behind the beneficent bars of the broiler. The pie list swelled; the richer puddings had vanished; the sausage, with his drapery wrapped about him, barely lingered in a pleasant thanatopsis with the buckwheats and the sweet but doomed maple.  <br><br>  Sarah's fingers danced like midgets above a summer stream. Down through the courses she worked, giving each item its position according to its length with an accurate eye. Just above the desserts came the list of vegetables. Carrots and peas, asparagus on toast, the perennial tomatoes and corn and succotash, lima beans, cabbage--and then--  <br><br>  Sarah was crying over her bill of fare. Tears from the depths of some divine despair rose in her heart and gathered to her eyes. Down went her head on the little typewriter stand; and the keyboard rattled a dry accompaniment to her moist sobs.  <br><br>  For she had received no letter from Walter in two weeks, and the next item on the bill of fare was dandelions--dandelions with some kind of egg--but bother the egg!--dandelions, with whose golden blooms Walter had crowned her his queen of love and future bride--dandelions, the harbingers of spring, her sorrow's crown of sorrow--reminder of her happiest days.  <br><br>  Madam, I dare you to smile until you suffer this test: Let the Marechal Niel roses that Percy brought you on the night you gave him your heart be served as a salad with French dressing before your eyes at a Schulenberg table d'hote. Had Juliet so seen her love tokens dishonoured the sooner would she have sought the lethean herbs of the good apothecary.  <br><br>  But what a witch is Spring! Into the great cold city of stone and iron a message had to be sent. There was none to convey it but the little hardy courier of the fields with his rough green coat and modest air. He is a true soldier of fortune, this dent-de-lion-- this lion's tooth, as the French chefs call him. Flowered, he will assist at love-making, wreathed in my lady's nut-brown hair; young and callow and unblossomed, he goes into the boiling pot and delivers the word of his sovereign mistress.  <br><br>  By and by Sarah forced back her tears. The cards must be written. But, still in a faint, golden glow from her dandeleonine dream, she fingered the typewriter keys absently for a little while, with her mind and heart in the meadow lane with her young farmer. But soon she came swiftly back to the rock-bound lanes of Manhattan, and the typewriter began to rattle and jump like a strike-breaker's motor car.  <br><br>  At 6 o'clock the waiter brought her dinner and carried away the typewritten bill of fare. When Sarah ate she set aside, with a sigh, the dish of dandelions with its crowning ovarious accompaniment. As this dark mass had been transformed from a bright and love-indorsed flower to be an ignominious vegetable, so had her summer hopes wilted and perished. Love may, as Shakespeare said, feed on itself: but Sarah could not bring herself to eat the dandelions that had graced, as ornaments, the first spiritual banquet of her heart's true affection.  <br><br>  At 7:30 the couple in the next room began to quarrel: the man in the room above sought for A on his flute; the gas went a little lower; three coal wagons started to unload--the only sound of which the phonograph is jealous; cats on the back fences slowly retreated toward Mukden. By these signs Sarah knew that it was time for her to read. She got out ""The Cloister and the Hearth,"" the best non- selling book of the month, settled her feet on her trunk, and began to wander with Gerard.  <br><br>  The front door bell rang. The landlady answered it. Sarah left Gerard and Denys treed by a bear and listened. Oh, yes; you would, just as she did!  <br><br>  And then a strong voice was heard in the hall below, and Sarah jumped for her door, leaving the book on the floor and the first round easily the bear's. You have guessed it. She reached the top of the stairs just as her farmer came up, three at a jump, and reaped and garnered her, with nothing left for the gleaners.  <br><br>  ""Why haven't you written--oh, why?"" cried Sarah.  <br><br>  ""New York is a pretty large town,"" said Walter Franklin. ""I came in a week ago to your old address. I found that you went away on a Thursday. That consoled some; it eliminated the possible Friday bad luck. But it didn't prevent my hunting for you with police and otherwise ever since!  <br><br>  ""I wrote!"" said Sarah, vehemently.  <br><br>  ""Never got it!""  <br><br>  ""Then how did you find me?""  <br><br>  The young farmer smiled a springtime smile. ""I dropped into that Home Restaurant next door this evening,"" said he. ""I don't care who knows it; I like a dish of some kind of greens at this time of the year. I ran my eye down that nice typewritten bill of fare looking for something in that line. When I got below cabbage I turned my chair over and hollered for the proprietor. He told me where you lived.""  <br><br>  ""I remember,"" sighed Sarah, happily. ""That was dandelions below cabbage.""  <br><br>  ""I'd know that cranky capital W 'way above the line that your typewriter makes anywhere in the world,"" said Franklin.  <br><br>  ""Why, there's no W in dandelions,"" said Sarah, in surprise.  <br><br>  The young man drew the bill of fare from his pocket, and pointed to a line.  <br><br>  Sarah recognised the first card she had typewritten that afternoon. There was still the rayed splotch in the upper right-hand corner where a tear had fallen. But over the spot where one should have read the name of the meadow plant, the clinging memory of their golden blossoms had allowed her fingers to strike strange keys.  <br><br>  Between the red cabbage and the stuffed green peppers was the item:  <br><br>  ""DEAREST WALTER, WITH HARD-BOILED EGG.""  <br><br>"
84,The Cactus,"The most notable thing about Time is that it is so purely relative. A large amount of reminiscence is, by common consent, conceded to the drowning man; and it is not past belief that one may review an entire courtship while removing one's gloves.<br><br>    That is what Trysdale was doing, standing by a table in his bachelor apartments. On the table stood a singular-looking green plant in a red earthen jar. The plant was one of the species of cacti, and was provided with long, tentacular leaves that perpetually swayed with the slightest breeze with a peculiar beckoning motion.<br><br>    Trysdale's friend, the brother of the bride, stood at a sideboard complaining at being allowed to drink alone. Both men were in evening dress. White favors like stars upon their coats shone through the gloom of the apartment.<br><br>    As he slowly unbuttoned his gloves, there passed through Trysdale's mind a swift, scarifying retrospect of the last few hours. It seemed that in his nostrils was still the scent of the flowers that had been banked in odorous masses about the church, and in his ears the lowpitched hum of a thousand well-bred voices, the rustle of crisp garments, and, most insistently recurring, the drawling words of the minister irrevocably binding her to another.<br><br>    From this last hopeless point of view he still strove, as if it had become a habit of his mind, to reach some conjecture as to why and how he had lost her. Shaken rudely by the uncompromising fact, he had suddenly found himself confronted by a thing he had never before faced --his own innermost, unmitigated, arid unbedecked self. He saw all the garbs of pretence and egoism that he had worn now turn to rags of folly. He shuddered at the thought that to others, before now, the garments of his soul must have appeared sorry and threadbare. Vanity and conceit? These were the joints in his armor. And how free from either she had always been--But why--<br><br>    As she had slowly moved up the aisle toward the altar he had felt an unworthy, sullen exultation that had served to support him. He had told himself that her paleness was from thoughts of another than the man to whom she was about to give herself. But even that poor consolation had been wrenched from him. For, when he saw that swift, limpid, upward look that she gave the man when he took her hand, he knew himself to be forgotten. Once that same look had been raised to him, and he had gauged its meaning. Indeed, his conceit had crumbled; its last prop was gone. Why had it ended thus? There had been no quarrel between them, nothing--<br><br>    For the thousandth time he remarshalled in his mind the events of those last few days before the tide had so suddenly turned.<br><br>    She had always insisted upon placing him upon a pedestal, and he had accepted her homage with royal grandeur. It had been a very sweet incense that she had burned before him; so modest (he told himself); so childlike and worshipful, and (he would once have sworn) so sincere. She had invested him with an almost supernatural number of high attributes and excellencies and talents, and he had absorbed the oblation as a desert drinks the rain that can coax from it no promise of blossom or fruit.<br><br>    As Trysdale grimly wrenched apart the seam of his last glove, the crowning instance of his fatuous and tardily mourned egoism came vividly back to him. The scene was the night when he had asked her to come up on his pedestal with him and share his greatness. He could not, now, for the pain of it, allow his mind to dwell upon the memory of her convincing beauty that night--the careless wave of her hair, the tenderness and virginal charm of her looks and words. But they had been enough, and they had brought him to speak. During their conversation she had said:<br><br>    ""And Captain Carruthers tells me that you speak the Spanish language like a native. Why have you hidden this accomplishment from me? Is there anything you do not know?""<br><br>    Now, Carruthers was an idiot. No doubt he (Trysdale) had been guilty (he sometimes did such things) of airing at the club some old, canting Castilian proverb dug from the hotchpotch at the back of dictionaries. Carruthers, who was one of his incontinent admirers, was the very man to have magnified this exhibition of doubtful erudition.<br><br>    But, alas! the incense of her admiration had been so sweet and flattering. He allowed the imputation to pass without denial. Without protest, he allowed her to twine about his brow this spurious bay of Spanish scholarship. He let it grace his conquering head, and, among its soft convolutions, he did not feel the prick of the thorn that was to pierce him later.<br><br>    How glad, how shy, how tremulous she was! How she fluttered like a snared bird when he laid his mightiness at her feet! He could have sworn, and he could swear now, that unmistakable consent was in her eyes, but, coyly, she would give him no direct answer. ""I will send you my answer to-morrow,"" she said; and he, the indulgent, confident victor, smilingly granted the delay. The next day he waited, impatient, in his rooms for the word. At noon her groom came to the door and left the strange cactus in the red earthen jar. There was no note, no message, merely a tag upon the plant bearing a barbarous foreign or botanical name. He waited until night, but her answer did not come. His large pride and hurt vanity kept him from seeking her. Two evenings later they met at a dinner. Their greetings were conventional, but she looked at him, breathless, wondering, eager. He was courteous, adamant, waiting her explanation. With womanly swiftness she took her cue from his manner, and turned to snow and ice. Thus, and wider from this on, they had drifted apart. Where was his fault? Who had been to blame? Humbled now, he sought the answer amid the ruins of his self-conceit. If--<br><br>    The voice of the other man in the room, querulously intruding upon his thoughts, aroused him.<br><br>    ""I say, Trysdale, what the deuce is the matter with you? You look unhappy as if you yourself had been married instead of having acted merely as an accomplice. Look at me, another accessory, come two thousand miles on a garlicky, cockroachy banana steamer all the way from South America to connive at the sacrifice--please to observe how lightly my guilt rests upon my shoulders. Only little sister I had, too, and now she's gone. Come now! take something to ease your conscience.""<br><br>    ""I don't drink just now, thanks,"" said Trysdale.<br><br>    ""Your brandy,"" resumed the other, coming over and joining him, ""is abominable. Run down to see me some time at Punta Redonda, and try some of our stuff that old Garcia smuggles in. It's worth the, trip. Hallo! here's an old acquaintance. Wherever did you rake up this cactus, Trysdale?""<br><br>    ""A present,"" said Trysdale, ""from a friend. Know the species?""<br><br>    ""Very well. It's a tropical concern. See hundreds of 'em around Punta every day. Here's the name on this tag tied to it. Know any Spanish, Trysdale?""<br><br>    ""No,"" said Trysdale, with the bitter wraith of a smile--""Is it Spanish?""<br><br>    ""Yes. The natives imagine the leaves are reaching out and beckoning to you. They call it by this name--Ventomarme. Name means in English, 'Come and take me.'""                             <br><br>"
85,The Clarion Call,"  Half of this story can be found in the records of  the Police Department; the other half belong behind  the business counter of a newspaper office.  <br><br>  One afternoon two weeks after Millionaire Nor-  cross was found in his apartment murdered by a bur-  glar, the murderer, while strolling serenely down  Broadway ran plump against Detective Barney  Woods.  <br><br>  ""Is that you, Johnny Kernan?"" asked Woods,  who had been near-sighted in public for five years.  <br><br>  ""No less,"" cried Kernan, heartily.  ""If it isn't  Barney Woods, late and early of old Saint Jo!  You'll have to show me!  What are you doing East?  Do the green-goods circulars get out that far?""  said Woods.  <br><br>  ""I've been in New York some years, I'm on the city   detective force.""  <br><br>  ""Well, well!"" said Kernan, breathing smiling joy  and patting the detective's arm.  <br><br>  ""Come into Muller's,"" said Woods, ""and let's  hunt a quiet table.  I'd like to talk to you awhile.""  <br><br>  It lacked a few minutes to the hour of four.  The  tides of trade were not yet loosed, and they found a  quiet corner of the cafe.  Kernan, well dressed  Slightly swaggering, self-confident, seated himself op-  posite the little detective, with his pale, sandy mus-  tache, squinting eyes and ready-made cheviot suit.  <br><br>  ""What business are you in now?"" asked Woods.  ""You know you left Saint Jo a year before I did.""  <br><br>  ""I'm selling shares in a copper mine,"" said Ker-  nan.  ""I may establish an office here.  Well, well!  and so old Barney is a New York detective.  You  always had a turn that way.  You were on the po-  lice in Saint Jo after I left there, weren't you?""  <br><br>  ""Six months,"" said Woods.  ""And now there's one  more question, Johnny.  I've followed your record  pretty close ever since you did that hotel job in Sara-  toga, and I never knew you to use your gun before.  Why did you kill Norcross?""  <br><br>  Kernan stared for a few moments with concen-  trated attention at the slice of lemon in his high-ball;  and then be looked at the detective with a sudden,  crooked, brilliant smile.  <br><br>  ""How did you guess it, Barney?  "" he asked, ad-  miringly.  ""I swear I thought the job was as clean  and as smooth as a peeled onion.  Did I leave a string  hanging out anywhere?  ""  <br><br>  Woods laid upon the table a small gold pencil in-  tended for a watch-charm.  <br><br>  ""It's the one I gave you the last Christmas we  were in Saint Jo.  I've got your shaving mug yet.  I found this under a corner of the rug in Norcross's  room.  I warn you to be careful what you say. I've  got it put on to you, Johnny.  We were old friends  once, but I must do my duty.  You'll have to go to  the chair for Norcross.""  Kernan laughed.  <br><br>  ""My luck stays with me,"" said be.  ""Who'd have  thought old Barney was on my trail!""  He slipped  one hand inside his coat.  In an instant Woods had  a revolver against his side.  <br><br>  ""Put it away,"" said Kernan, wrinkling his nose.  ""I'm only investigating.  Aha!  It takes nine tailors  to make a man, but one can do a man up. There's  a hole in that vest pocket.  I took that pencil off my  chain and slipped it in there in case of a scrap.  Put  up your gun, Barney, and I'll tell you why I had  to shoot Norcross.  The old fool started down the  hall after me, popping at the buttons on the back of  my coat with a peevish little .22 and I had to stop  him.  The old lady was a darling.  She just lay in  bed and saw her $12,000 diamond necklace go with-  out a chirp, while she begged like a panhandler to  have back a little thin gold ring with a garnet worth  about $3. 1 guess she married old Norcross for his  money, all right.  Don't they hang on to the little  trinkets from the Man Who Lost Out, though?  There were six rings, two brooches and a chatelaine  watch.  Fifteen thousand would cover the lot.""  <br><br>  ""I warned you not to talk,"" said Woods.  <br><br>  ""Oh, that's all right,"" said Kernan.  ""The stuff  is in my suit case at the hotel.  And now I'll tell you  why I'm talking.  Because it's safe.  I'm talking to  a man I know.  You owe me a thousand dollars, Bar-  ney Woods, and even if you wanted to arrest me your  hand wouldn't make the move.""  <br><br>  ""I haven't forgotten,"" said Woods.  ""You counted  out twenty fifties without a word.  I'll pay it back  some day.  That thousand saved me and -- well, they  were piling my furniture out on the sidewalk when I  got back to the house.""  <br><br>  ""And so,"" continued Kernan, ""you being Barney  Woods, born as true as steel, and bound to play a  white man's game, can't lift a finger to arrest the  man you're indebted to.  Oh, I have to study men  as well as Yale locks and window fastenings in my  business.  Now, keep quiet while I ring for the  waiter.  I've had a thirst for a year or two that wor-  ries me a little.  If I'm ever caught the lucky sleuth  will have to divide honors with old boy Booze.  But I  never drink during business hours.  After a job I  can crook elbows with my old friend Barney with a  clear conscience.  What are you taking?""  <br><br>  The waiter came with the little decanters and the  siphon and left them alone again.  <br><br>  ""You've called the turn,"" said Woods, as he rolled  the little gold pencil about with a thoughtful fore-  finger.  I've got to pass you up. I can't lay a  hand on you.  If I'd a-paid that money back -- but  I didn't, and that settles it.  It's a bad break I'm  making, Johnny, but I can't dodge it.  You helped  me once, and it calls for the same.""  <br><br>  ""I knew it,"" said Kernan, raising his glass, with  a flushed smile of self-appreciation.  ""I can judge  men.  Here's to Barney, for -- 'he's a jolly good  fellow.' ""  <br><br>  ""I don't believe,"" went on Woods quietly, as if be  were thinking aloud, ""that if accounts had been  square between you and me, all the money in all the  banks in New York could have bought you out of  my hands to-night.""  <br><br>  ""I know it couldn't,"" said Kernan.  ""That's why  I knew I was safe with you.""  <br><br>  ""Most people,"" continued the detective, ""look side-  ways at my business.  They don't class it among the  fine arts and the professions.  But I've always taken  a kind of fool pride in it.  And here is where I go  'busted.' I guess I'm a man first and a detective  afterward.  I've got to let you go, and then I've got  to resign from the force.  I guess I can drive an ex-  press wagon.  Your thousand dollars is further off  than ever, Johnny.""  <br><br>  ""Oh, you're welcome to it,"" said Kernan, with a  lordly air.  ""I'd be willing to call the debt off, but  I know you wouldn't have it It was a lucky day  for me when you borrowed it.  And now, let's drop  the subject.  I'm off to the West on a morning train.  I know a place out there where I can negotiate the  Norcross sparks.  Drink up, Barney, and forget your  troubles.  We'll have a jolly time while the police  are knocking their heads together over the case.  I've got one of my Sahara thirsts on to-night.  But  I'm in the bands -- the unofficial bands -- of my old  friend Barney, and I won't even dream of a cop.""  <br><br>  And then, as Kernan's ready finger kept the but-  ton and the waiter working, his weak point -- a tre-  mendous vanity and arrogant egotism, began to show  itself.  He recounted story after story of his suc-  cessful plunderings, ingenious plots and infamous  transgressions until Woods, with all his familiarity  with evil-doers, felt growing within him a cold ab-  horrence toward the utterly vicious man who had  once been his benefactor.  <br><br>  ""I'm disposed of, of course,"" said Woods, at  length.  ""But I advise you to keep under cover for a  spell.  The newspapers may take up this Norcross  affair.  There has been an epidemic of burglaries and  manslaughter in town this summer.""  <br><br>  The word sent Kernan into a high glow of sullen  and vindictive rage.  <br><br>  ""To hell with the newspapers,"" he growled.  ""What do they spell but brag and blow and boodle in  box-car letters?  Suppose they do take up a case  what does it amount to?  The police are easy enough  to fool; but what do the newspapers do?  They send  a lot of pin-head reporters around to the scene; and  they make for the nearest saloon and have beer while  they take photos of the bartender's oldest daughter  in evening dress, to print as the fiancee of the young  man in the tenth story, who thought he heard a noise  below on the night of the murder.  That's about as  near as the newspapers ever come to running down  Mr. Burglar.""  <br><br>  ""Well, I don't know,"" said Woods, reflecting.  ""Some of the papers have done good work in that  line.  There's the Morning Mars, for instance.  It  warmed up two or three trails, and got the man after  the police had let 'em get cold.""  <br><br>  ""I'll show you,"" said Tiernan, rising, and expand-  ing his chest.  ""I'll show you what I think of news-  papers in general, and your Morning Mars in par-  ticular.""  <br><br>  Three feet from their table was the telephone  booth.  Kernan went inside and sat at the instrument,  leaving the door open.  He found a number in the  book, took down the receiver and made his demand  upon Central.  Woods sat still, looking at the sneer-  ing, cold, vigilant face waiting close to the trans-  mitter, and listened to the words that came from the  thin, truculent lips curved into a contemptuous smile.  <br><br>  ""That the Morning Mars?  .  .  .  I want to  speak to the managing editor  .  .  .  Why, tell  him it's some one who wants to talk to him about the  Norcross murder.  <br><br>  ""You the editor?  .  .  .  All right.  .  .  .  I  am the man who killed old Norcross  .  .  .  Wait!  Hold the wire; I'm not the usual crank  .  .  .  oh,  there isn't the slightest danger.  I've just been dis-  cussing it with a detective friend of mine.  I killed  the old man at 2:30 A. M. two weeks ago to-  morrow.  .  .  .  Have a drink with you? Now,  hadn't you better leave that kind of talk to your  funny man?  Can't you tell whether a man's guying  you or whether you're being offered the biggest scoop  your dull dishrag of a paper ever had?  .  .  .    Well, that's so; it's a bobtail scoop -- but you can  hardly expect me to 'phone in my name and address.  <br><br>  .  .  .  Why? Oh, because I beard you make a  specialty of solving mysterious crimes that stump the  police.  .  .  .  No, that's not all.  I want to tell  you that your rotten, lying, penny sheet is of no more  use in tracking an intelligent murderer or highway-  man than a blind poodle would be.  .  .  .  What?  .  .  .  Oh, no, this isn't a rival newspaper office;  you're getting it straight.  I did the Norcross job,  and I've got the jewels in my suit case at -- 'the  name of the hotel could not be learned' -- you recog-  nize that phrase, don't you?  I thought so.  You've  used it often enough.  Kind of rattles you, doesn't  it, to have the mysterious villain call up your great,  big, all-powerful organ of right and justice and good  government and tell you what a helpless old gas-bag  you are?  .  .  .  Cut that out; you're not that big  a fool -- no, you don't think I'm a fraud.  I can tell  it by your voice.  .  .  .  Now, listen, and I'll give  you a pointer that will prove it to you.  Of course  you've had this murder case worked over by your staff  of bright young blockheads.  Half of the second but-  ton on old Mrs. Norcross's nightgown is broken off.  I saw it when I took the garnet ring off her finger.  I thought it was a ruby.  .  .  .  -- Stop that!  it  won't work.""  <br><br>  Kernan turned to Woods with a diabolic smile.  <br><br>  ""I've got him going.  He believes me now.  He  didn't quite cover the transmitter with his hand when  he told somebody to call up Central on another 'phone  and get our number.  I'll give him just one more dig,  and then we'll make a 'get-away.'  <br><br>  ""Hello!  .  .  .  Yes.  I'm here yet. You  didn't think -- I'd run from such a little subsidized, turn-  coat rag of a newspaper, did you?  .  .  .  Have  me inside of forty-eight hours?  Say, will you quit  being funny?  Now, you let grown men alone and at-  tend to your business of hunting up divorce cases  and street-car accidents and printing the filth and  scandal that you make your living by.  Good-by, old  boy -- sorry I haven't time to call on you.  I'd feel  perfectly safe in your sanctum asinorum.  Tra-la!""  <br><br>  ""He's as mad as a cat that's lost a mouse,""  said  Kernan, hanging up the receiver and coming out.  <br><br>  ""And now, Barney, my boy, we'll go to a show and  enjoy ourselves until a reasonable bedtime.  Four  hours' sleep for me, and then the west-bound.""  <br><br>  The two dined in a Broadway restaurant.  Kernan  was pleased with himself.  He spent money like a  prince of fiction.  And then a weird and gorgeous  musical comedy engaged their attention.  Afterward  there was a late supper in a grillroom, with  champagne, and Kernan at the height of his com-  placency.  <br><br>  Half-past three in the morning found them in a  corner of an all-night cafe, Kernan still boasting in  a vapid and rambling way, Woods thinking moodily  over the end that had come to his usefulness as an  upholder of the law.  <br><br>  But, as he pondered, his eye brightened with a  speculative light.  <br><br>  ""I wonder if it's possible,"" be said to himself, ""I  won-der if it's pos-si-ble!  <br><br>  And then outside the cafe the comparative stillness  of the early morning was punctured by faint, uncer-  tain cries that seemed mere fireflies of sound, some  growing louder, some fainter, waxing and waning  amid the rumble of milk wagons and infrequent cars.  Shrill cries they were when near -- well-known cries  that conveyed many meanings to the ears of those of  the slumbering millions of the great city who waked  to hear them.  Cries that bore upon their significant,  small volume the weight of a world's woe and laugh-  ter and delight and stress.  To some, cowering be-  neath the protection of a night's ephemeral cover,  they brought news of the hideous, bright day; to  others, wrapped in happy sleep, they announced a  morning that would dawn blacker than sable night.  To many of the rich they brought a besom to sweep  away what had been theirs while the stars shone; to  the poor they brought -- another day.  <br><br>  All over the city the cries were starting up, keen  and sonorous, heralding the chances that the slip-  ping of one cogwheel in the machinery of time had  made; apportioning to the sleepers while they lay  at the mercy of fate, the vengeance, profit, grief,  reward and doom that the new figure in the calen-  dar had brought them.  Shrill and yet plaintive  were the cries, as if the young voices grieved that so  much evil and so little good was in their irresponsible  hands.  Thus echoed in the streets of the helpless  city the transmission of the latest decrees of the gods,  the cries of the newsboys -- the Clarion Call of the  Press.  <br><br>  Woods flipped a dime to the waiter, and said:  ""Get me a Morning Mars.""  <br><br>  When the paper came he glanced at its first page,  and then tore a leaf out of his memorandum book  and began to write on it with the little old pencil.  <br><br>  ""What's the news?""' yawned Kernan.  <br><br>  Woods flipped over to him the piece of writing:  <br><br>  ""The New York Morning Mars:  <br><br>  ""Please pay to the order of John Kernan the one thousand  dollars reward coming to me for his arrest and conviction.  <br><br>  ""BARNARD WOODS.""  <br><br>  ""I kind of thought they would do that,"" said  Woods, ""when you were jollying them so hard.  Now,  Johnny, you'll come to the police station with me.""                             <br><br>"
86,The Cop And The Anthem,"  On his bench in Madison Square Soapy moved uneasily. When wild geese honk high of nights, and when women without sealskin coats grow kind to their husbands, and when Soapy moves uneasily on his bench in the park, you may know that winter is near at hand.  <br><br>  A dead leaf fell in Soapy's lap. That was Jack Frost's card. Jack is kind to the regular denizens of Madison Square, and gives fair warning of his annual call. At the corners of four streets he hands his pasteboard to the North Wind, footman of the mansion of All Outdoors, so that the inhabitants thereof may make ready.  <br><br>  Soapy's mind became cognisant of the fact that the time had come for him to resolve himself into a singular Committee of Ways and Means to provide against the coming rigour. And therefore he moved uneasily on his bench.  <br><br>  The hibernatorial ambitions of Soapy were not of the highest. In them there were no considerations of Mediterranean cruises, of soporific Southern skies drifting in the Vesuvian Bay. Three months on the Island was what his soul craved. Three months of assured board and bed and congenial company, safe from Boreas and bluecoats, seemed to Soapy the essence of things desirable.  <br><br>  For years the hospitable Blackwell's had been his winter quarters. Just as his more fortunate fellow New Yorkers had bought their tickets to Palm Beach and the Riviera each winter, so Soapy had made his humble arrangements for his annual hegira to the Island. And now the time was come. On the previous night three Sabbath newspapers, distributed beneath his coat, about his ankles and over his lap, had failed to repulse the cold as he slept on his bench near the spurting fountain in the ancient square. So the Island loomed big and timely in Soapy's mind. He scorned the provisions made in the name of charity for the city's dependents. In Soapy's opinion the Law was more benign than Philanthropy. There was an endless round of institutions, municipal and eleemosynary, on which he might set out and receive lodging and food accordant with the simple life. But to one of Soapy's proud spirit the gifts of charity are encumbered. If not in coin you must pay in humiliation of spirit for every benefit received at the hands of philanthropy. As Caesar had his Brutus, every bed of charity must have its toll of a bath, every loaf of bread its compensation of a private and personal inquisition. Wherefore it is better to be a guest of the law, which though conducted by rules, does not meddle unduly with a gentleman's private affairs.  <br><br>  Soapy, having decided to go to the Island, at once set about accomplishing his desire. There were many easy ways of doing this. The pleasantest was to dine luxuriously at some expensive restaurant; and then, after declaring insolvency, be handed over quietly and without uproar to a policeman. An accommodating magistrate would do the rest.  <br><br>  Soapy left his bench and strolled out of the square and across the level sea of asphalt, where Broadway and Fifth Avenue flow together. Up Broadway he turned, and halted at a glittering cafe, where are gathered together nightly the choicest products of the grape, the silkworm and the protoplasm.  <br><br>  Soapy had confidence in himself from the lowest button of his vest upward. He was shaven, and his coat was decent and his neat black, ready-tied four-in-hand had been presented to him by a lady missionary on Thanksgiving Day. If he could reach a table in the restaurant unsuspected success would be his. The portion of him that would show above the table would raise no doubt in the waiter's mind. A roasted mallard duck, thought Soapy, would be about the thing--with a bottle of Chablis, and then Camembert, a demi-tasse and a cigar. One dollar for the cigar would be enough. The total would not be so high as to call forth any supreme manifestation of revenge from the cafe management; and yet the meat would leave him filled and happy for the journey to his winter refuge.  <br><br>  But as Soapy set foot inside the restaurant door the head waiter's eye fell upon his frayed trousers and decadent shoes. Strong and ready hands turned him about and conveyed him in silence and haste to the sidewalk and averted the ignoble fate of the menaced mallard.  <br><br>  Soapy turned off Broadway. It seemed that his route to the coveted island was not to be an epicurean one. Some other way of entering limbo must be thought of.  <br><br>  At a corner of Sixth Avenue electric lights and cunningly displayed wares behind plate-glass made a shop window conspicuous. Soapy took a cobblestone and dashed it through the glass. People came running around the corner, a policeman in the lead. Soapy stood still, with his hands in his pockets, and smiled at the sight of brass buttons.  <br><br>  ""Where's the man that done that?"" inquired the officer excitedly.  <br><br>  ""Don't you figure out that I might have had something to do with it?"" said Soapy, not without sarcasm, but friendly, as one greets good fortune.  <br><br>  The policeman's mind refused to accept Soapy even as a clue. Men who smash windows do not remain to parley with the law's minions. They take to their heels. The policeman saw a man half way down the block running to catch a car. With drawn club he joined in the pursuit. Soapy, with disgust in his heart, loafed along, twice unsuccessful.  <br><br>  On the opposite side of the street was a restaurant of no great pretensions. It catered to large appetites and modest purses. Its crockery and atmosphere were thick; its soup and napery thin. Into this place Soapy took his accusive shoes and telltale trousers without challenge. At a table he sat and consumed beefsteak, flapjacks, doughnuts and pie. And then to the waiter be betrayed the fact that the minutest coin and himself were strangers.  <br><br>  ""Now, get busy and call a cop,"" said Soapy. ""And don't keep a gentleman waiting.""  <br><br>  ""No cop for youse,"" said the waiter, with a voice like butter cakes and an eye like the cherry in a Manhattan cocktail. ""Hey, Con!""  <br><br>  Neatly upon his left ear on the callous pavement two waiters pitched Soapy. He arose, joint by joint, as a carpenter's rule opens, and beat the dust from his clothes. Arrest seemed but a rosy dream. The Island seemed very far away. A policeman who stood before a drug store two doors away laughed and walked down the street.  <br><br>  Five blocks Soapy travelled before his courage permitted him to woo capture again. This time the opportunity presented what he fatuously termed to himself a ""cinch."" A young woman of a modest and pleasing guise was standing before a show window gazing with sprightly interest at its display of shaving mugs and inkstands, and two yards from the window a large policeman of severe demeanour leaned against a water plug.  <br><br>  It was Soapy's design to assume the role of the despicable and execrated ""masher."" The refined and elegant appearance of his victim and the contiguity of the conscientious cop encouraged him to believe that he would soon feel the pleasant official clutch upon his arm that would insure his winter quarters on the right little, tight little isle.  <br><br>  Soapy straightened the lady missionary's readymade tie, dragged his shrinking cuffs into the open, set his hat at a killing cant and sidled toward the young woman. He made eyes at her, was taken with sudden coughs and ""hems,"" smiled, smirked and went brazenly through the impudent and contemptible litany of the ""masher."" With half an eye Soapy saw that the policeman was watching him fixedly. The young woman moved away a few steps, and again bestowed her absorbed attention upon the shaving mugs. Soapy followed, boldly stepping to her side, raised his hat and said:  <br><br>  ""Ah there, Bedelia! Don't you want to come and play in my yard?""  <br><br>  The policeman was still looking. The persecuted young woman had but to beckon a finger and Soapy would be practically en route for his insular haven. Already he imagined he could feel the cozy warmth of the station-house. The young woman faced him and, stretching out a hand, caught Soapy's coat sleeve.  <br><br>  Sure, Mike,"" she said joyfully, ""if you'll blow me to a pail of suds. I'd have spoke to you sooner, but the cop was watching.""  <br><br>  With the young woman playing the clinging ivy to his oak Soapy walked past the policeman overcome with gloom. He seemed doomed to liberty.  <br><br>  At the next corner he shook off his companion and ran. He halted in the district where by night are found the lightest streets, hearts, vows and librettos.  <br><br>  Women in furs and men in greatcoats moved gaily in the wintry air. A sudden fear seized Soapy that some dreadful enchantment had rendered him immune to arrest. The thought brought a little of panic upon it, and when he came upon another policeman lounging grandly in front of a transplendent theatre he caught at the immediate straw of ""disorderly conduct.""  <br><br>  On the sidewalk Soapy began to yell drunken gibberish at the top of his harsh voice. He danced, howled, raved and otherwise disturbed the welkin.  <br><br>  The policeman twirled his club, turned his back to Soapy and remarked to a citizen.  <br><br>  ""'Tis one of them Yale lads celebratin' the goose egg they give to the Hartford College. Noisy; but no harm. We've instructions to lave them be.""  <br><br>  Disconsolate, Soapy ceased his unavailing racket. Would never a policeman lay hands on him? In his fancy the Island seemed an unattainable Arcadia. He buttoned his thin coat against the chilling wind.  <br><br>  In a cigar store he saw a well-dressed man lighting a cigar at a swinging light. His silk umbrella he had set by the door on entering. Soapy stepped inside, secured the umbrella and sauntered off with it slowly. The man at the cigar light followed hastily.  <br><br>  ""My umbrella,"" he said, sternly.  <br><br>  ""Oh, is it?"" sneered Soapy, adding insult to petit larceny. ""Well, why don't you call a policeman? I took it. Your umbrella! Why don't you call a cop? There stands one on the corner.""  <br><br>  The umbrella owner slowed his steps. Soapy did likewise, with a presentiment that luck would again run against him. The policeman looked at the two curiously.  <br><br>  ""Of course,"" said the umbrella man--""that is--well, you know how these mistakes occur--I--if it's your umbrella I hope you'll excuse me--I picked it up this morning in a restaurant--If you recognise it as yours, why--I hope you'll--""  <br><br>  ""Of course it's mine,"" said Soapy, viciously.  <br><br>  The ex-umbrella man retreated. The policeman hurried to assist a tall blonde in an opera cloak across the street in front of a street car that was approaching two blocks away.  <br><br>  Soapy walked eastward through a street damaged by improvements. He hurled the umbrella wrathfully into an excavation. He muttered against the men who wear helmets and carry clubs. Because he wanted to fall into their clutches, they seemed to regard him as a king who could do no wrong.  <br><br>  At length Soapy reached one of the avenues to the east where the glitter and turmoil was but faint. He set his face down this toward Madison Square, for the homing instinct survives even when the home is a park bench.  <br><br>  But on an unusually quiet corner Soapy came to a standstill. Here was an old church, quaint and rambling and gabled. Through one violet-stained window a soft light glowed, where, no doubt, the organist loitered over the keys, making sure of his mastery of the coming Sabbath anthem. For there drifted out to Soapy's ears sweet music that caught and held him transfixed against the convolutions of the iron fence.  <br><br>  The moon was above, lustrous and serene; vehicles and pedestrians were few; sparrows twittered sleepily in the eaves--for a little while the scene might have been a country churchyard. And the anthem that the organist played cemented Soapy to the iron fence, for he had known it well in the days when his life contained such things as mothers and roses and ambitions and friends and immaculate thoughts and collars.  <br><br>  The conjunction of Soapy's receptive state of mind and the influences about the old church wrought a sudden and wonderful change in his soul. He viewed with swift horror the pit into which he had tumbled, the degraded days, unworthy desires, dead hopes, wrecked faculties and base motives that made up his existence.  <br><br>  And also in a moment his heart responded thrillingly to this novel mood. An instantaneous and strong impulse moved him to battle with his desperate fate. He would pull himself out of the mire; he would make a man of himself again; he would conquer the evil that had taken possession of him. There was time; he was comparatively young yet; he would resurrect his old eager ambitions and pursue them without faltering. Those solemn but sweet organ notes had set up a revolution in him. To-morrow he would go into the roaring downtown district and find work. A fur importer had once offered him a place as driver. He would find him to-morrow and ask for the position. He would be somebody in the world. He would--  <br><br>  Soapy felt a hand laid on his arm. He looked quickly around into the broad face of a policeman.  <br><br>  ""What are you doin' here?"" asked the officer.  <br><br>  ""Nothin',"" said Soapy.  <br><br>  ""Then come along,"" said the policeman.  <br><br>  ""Three months on the Island,"" said the Magistrate in the Police Court the next morning.                             <br><br>"
87,The Detective Detector,"I was walking in Central Park with Avery Knight, the great New York burglar, highwayman, and murderer.<br><br>    ""But, my dear Knight,"" said I, ""it sounds incredible. You have undoubtedly performed some of the most wonderful feats in your profession known to modern crime. You have committed some marvellous deeds under the very noses of the police--you have boldly entered the homes of millionaires and held them up with an empty gun while you made free with their silver and jewels; you have sandbagged citizens in the glare of Broadway's electric lights; you have killed and robbed with superb openness and absolute impunity--but when you boast that within forty-eight hours after committing a murder you can run down and actually bring me face to face with the detective assigned to apprehend you, I must beg leave to express my doubts--remember, you are in New York.""<br><br>    Avery Knight smiled indulgently.<br><br>    ""You pique my professional pride, doctor,"" he said in a nettled tone. ""I will convince you.""<br><br>    About twelve yards in advance of us a prosperous-looking citizen was rounding a clump of bushes where the walk curved. Knight suddenly drew a revolver and shot the man in the back. His victim fell and lay without moving.<br><br>    The great murderer went up to him leisurely and took from his clothes his money, watch, and a valuable ring and cravat pin. He then rejoined me smiling calmly, and we continued our walk.<br><br>    Ten steps and we met a policeman running toward the spot where the shot had been fired. Avery Knight stopped him.<br><br>    ""I have just killed a man,"" he announced, seriously, ""and robbed him of his possessions.""<br><br>    ""G'wan,"" said the policeman, angrily, ""or I'll run yez in! Want yer name in the papers, don't yez? I never knew the cranks to come around so quick after a shootin' before. Out of th' park, now, for yours, or I'll fan yez.""<br><br>    ""What you have done,"" I said, argumentatively, as Knight and I walked on, ""was easy. But when you come to the task of hunting down the detective that they send upon your trail you will find that you have undertaken a difficult feat.""<br><br>    ""Perhaps so,"" said Knight, lightly. ""I will admit that my success depends in a degree upon the sort of man they start after me. If it should be an ordinary plain-clothes man I might fail to gain a sight of him. If they honor me by giving the case to some one of their celebrated sleuths I do not fear to match my cunning and powers of induction against his.""<br><br>    On the next afternoon Knight entered my office with a satisfied look on his keen countenance.<br><br>    ""How goes the mysterious murder?"" I asked.<br><br>    ""As usual,"" said Knight, smilingly. ""I have put in the morning at the police station and at the inquest. It seems that a card case of mine containing cards with my name and address was found near the body. They have three witnesses who saw the shooting and gave a description of me. The case has been placed in the hands of Shamrock Jolnes, the famous detective. He left Headquarters at 11:30 on the assignment. I waited at my address until two, thinking he might call there.""<br><br>    I laughed, tauntingly.<br><br>    ""You will never see Jolnes,"" I continued, ""until this murder has been forgotten, two or three weeks from now. I had a better opinion of your shrewdness, Knight. During the three hours and a half that you waited he has got out of your ken. He is after you on true induction theories now, and no wrongdoer has yet been known to come upon him while thus engaged. I advise you to give it up.""<br><br>    ""Doctor,"" said Knight, with a sudden glint in his keen gray eye and a squaring of his chin, ""in spite of the record your city holds of something like a dozen homicides without a subsequent meeting of the perpetrator, and the sleuth in charge of the case, I will undertake to break that record. To-morrow I will take you to Shamrock Jolnes-- I will unmask him before you and prove to you that it is not an impossibility for an officer of the law and a manslayer to stand face to face in your city.""<br><br>    ""Do it,"" said I, ""and you'll have the sincere thanks of the Police Department.""<br><br>    On the next day Knight called for me in a cab.<br><br>    ""I've been on one or two false scents, doctor,"" he admitted. ""I know something of detectives' methods, and I followed out a few of them, expecting to find Jolnes at the other end. The pistol being a .45- caliber, I thought surely I would find him at work on the clue in Forty-fifth Street. Then, again, I looked for the detective at the Columbia University, as the man's being shot in the back naturally suggested hazing. But I could not find a trace of him.""<br><br>    ""--Nor will you,"" I said, emphatically.<br><br>    ""Not by ordinary methods,"" said Knight. ""I might walk up and down Broadway for a month without success. But you have aroused my pride, doctor; and if I fail to show you Shamrock Jolnes this day, I promise you I will never kill or rob in your city again.""<br><br>    ""Nonsense, man,"" I replied. ""When our burglars walk into our houses and politely demand, thousands of dollars' worth of jewels, and then dine and bang the piano an hour or two before leaving, how do you, a mere murderer, expect to come in contact with the detective that is looking for you?""<br><br>    Avery Knight, sat lost in thought for a while. At length he looked up brightly.<br><br>    ""Doc,"" said he, ""I have it. Put on your hat, and come with me. In half an hour I guarantee that you shall stand in the presence of Shamrock Jolnes.""<br><br>    I entered a cab with Avery Knight. I did not hear his instructions to the driver, but the vehicle set out at a smart pace up Broadway, turning presently into Fifth Avenue, and proceeding northward again. It was with a rapidly beating heart that I accompanied this wonderful and gifted assassin, whose analytical genius and superb self- confidence had prompted him to make me the tremendous promise of bringing me into the presence of a murderer and the New York detective in pursuit of him simultaneously. Even yet I could not believe it possible.<br><br>    ""Are you sure that you are not being led into some trap?"" I asked. ""Suppose that your clue, whatever it is, should bring us only into the presence of the Commissioner of Police and a couple of dozen cops!""<br><br>    ""My dear doctor,"" said Knight, a little stiffly. ""I would remind you that I am no gambler.""<br><br>    ""I beg your pardon,"" said I. ""But I do not think you will find Jolnes.""<br><br>    The cab stopped before one of the handsomest residences on the avenue. Walking up and down in front of the house was a man with long red whiskers, with a detective's badge showing on the lapel of his coat. Now and then the man would remove his whiskers to wipe his face, and then I would recognize at once the well-known features of the great New York detective. Jolnes was keeping a sharp watch upon the doors and windows of the house.<br><br>    ""Well, doctor,"" said Knight, unable to repress a note of triumph in his voice, ""have you seen?""<br><br>    ""It is wonderful--wonderful!"" I could not help exclaiming as our cab started on its return trip. ""But how did you do it? By what process of induction--""<br><br>    ""My dear doctor,"" interrupted the great murderer, ""the inductive theory is what the detectives use. My process is more modern. I call it the saltatorial theory. Without bothering with the tedious mental phenomena necessary to the solution of a mystery from slight clues, I jump at once to a conclusion. I will explain to you the method I employed in this case.<br><br>    ""In the first place, I argued that as the crime was committed in New York City in broad daylight, in a public place and under peculiarly atrocious circumstances, and that as the most skilful sleuth available was let loose upon the case, the perpetrator would never be discovered. Do you not think my postulation justified by precedent?""<br><br>    ""Perhaps so,"" I replied, doggedly. ""But if Big Bill Dev--""<br><br>    ""Stop that,"" interrupted Knight, with a smile, ""I've heard that several times. It's too late now. I will proceed.<br><br>    ""If homicides in New York went undiscovered, I reasoned, although the best detective talent was employed to ferret them out, it must be true that the detectives went about their work in the wrong way. And not only in the wrong way, but exactly opposite from the right way. That was my clue.<br><br>    ""I slew the man in Central Park. Now, let me describe myself to you.<br><br>    ""I am tall, with a black beard, and I hate publicity. I have no money to speak of; I do not like oatmeal, and it is the one ambition of my life to die rich. I am of a cold and heartless disposition. I do not care for my fellowmen and I never give a cent to beggars or charity.<br><br>    ""Now, my dear doctor, that is the true description of myself, the man whom that shrewd detective was to hunt down. You who are familiar with the history of crime in New York of late should be able to foretell the result. When I promised you to exhibit to your incredulous gaze the sleuth who was set upon me, you laughed at me because you said that detectives and murderers never met in New York. I have demonstrated to you that the theory is possible.""<br><br>    ""But how did you do it?"" I asked again.<br><br>    ""It was very simple,"" replied the distinguished murderer. ""I assumed that the detective would go exactly opposite to the clues he had. I have given you a description of myself. Therefore, he must necessarily set to work and trail a short man with a white beard who likes to be in the papers, who is very wealthy, is fond 'of oatmeal, wants to die poor, and is of an extremely generous and philanthropic disposition. When thus far is reached the mind hesitates no longer. I conveyed you at once to the spot where Shamrock Jolnes was piping off Andrew Carnegie's residence.""<br><br>    ""Knight,"" said I, ""you're a wonder. If there was no danger of your reforming, what a rounds man you'd make for the Nineteenth Precinct!""                             <br><br>"
88,The Furnished Room,"  Restless, shifting, fugacious as time itself is a certain vast bulk of the population of the red brick district of the lower West Side. Homeless, they have a hundred homes. They flit from furnished room to furnished room, transients forever--transients in abode, transients in heart and mind. They sing ""Home, Sweet Home"" in ragtime; they carry their lares et penates in a bandbox; their vine is entwined about a picture hat; a rubber plant is their fig tree.  <br><br>  Hence the houses of this district, having had a thousand dwellers, should have a thousand tales to tell, mostly dull ones, no doubt; but it would be strange if there could not be found a ghost or two in the wake of all these vagrant guests.  <br><br>  One evening after dark a young man prowled among these crumbling red mansions, ringing their bells. At the twelfth he rested his lean hand-baggage upon the step and wiped the dust from his hatband and forehead. The bell sounded faint and far away in some remote, hollow depths.  <br><br>  To the door of this, the twelfth house whose bell he had rung, came a housekeeper who made him think of an unwholesome, surfeited worm that had eaten its nut to a hollow shell and now sought to fill the vacancy with edible lodgers.  <br><br>  He asked if there was a room to let.  <br><br>  ""Come in,"" said the housekeeper. Her voice came from her throat; her throat seemed lined with fur. ""I have the third floor back, vacant since a week back. Should you wish to look at it?""  <br><br>  The young man followed her up the stairs. A faint light from no particular source mitigated the shadows of the halls. They trod noiselessly upon a stair carpet that its own loom would have forsworn. It seemed to have become vegetable; to have degenerated in that rank, sunless air to lush lichen or spreading moss that grew in patches to the staircase and was viscid under the foot like organic matter. At each turn of the stairs were vacant niches in the wall. Perhaps plants had once been set within them. If so they had died in that foul and tainted air. It may be that statues of the saints had stood there, but it was not difficult to conceive that imps and devils had dragged them forth in the darkness and down to the unholy depths of some furnished pit below.  <br><br>  ""This is the room,"" said the housekeeper, from her furry throat. ""It's a nice room. It ain't often vacant. I had some most elegant people in it last summer--no trouble at all, and paid in advance to the minute. The water's at the end of the hall. Sprowls and Mooney kept it three months. They done a vaudeville sketch. Miss B'retta Sprowls--you may have heard of her--Oh, that was just the stage names --right there over the dresser is where the marriage certificate hung, framed. The gas is here, and you see there is plenty of closet room. It's a room everybody likes. It never stays idle long.""  <br><br>  ""Do you have many theatrical people rooming here?"" asked the young man.  <br><br>  ""They comes and goes. A good proportion of my lodgers is connected with the theatres. Yes, sir, this is the theatrical district. Actor people never stays long anywhere. I get my share. Yes, they comes and they goes.""  <br><br>  He engaged the room, paying for a week in advance. He was tired, he said, and would take possession at once. He counted out the money. The room had been made ready, she said, even to towels and water. As the housekeeper moved away he put, for the thousandth time, the question that he carried at the end of his tongue.  <br><br>  ""A young girl--Miss Vashner--Miss Eloise Vashner--do you remember such a one among your lodgers? She would be singing on the stage, most likely. A fair girl, of medium height and slender, with reddish, gold hair and a dark mole near her left eyebrow.""  <br><br>  ""No, I don't remember the name. Them stage people has names they change as often as their rooms. They comes and they goes. No, I don't call that one to mind.""  <br><br>  No. Always no. Five months of ceaseless interrogation and the inevitable negative. So much time spent by day in questioning managers, agents, schools and choruses; by night among the audiences of theatres from all-star casts down to music halls so low that he dreaded to find what he most hoped for. He who had loved her best had tried to find her. He was sure that since her disappearance from home this great, water-girt city held her somewhere, but it was like a monstrous quicksand, shifting its particles constantly, with no foundation, its upper granules of to-day buried to-morrow in ooze and slime.  <br><br>  The furnished room received its latest guest with a first glow of pseudo-hospitality, a hectic, haggard, perfunctory welcome like the specious smile of a demirep. The sophistical comfort came in reflected gleams from the decayed furniture, the raggcd brocade upholstery of a couch and two chairs, a footwide cheap pier glass between the two windows, from one or two gilt picture frames and a brass bedstead in a corner.  <br><br>  The guest reclined, inert, upon a chair, while the room, confused in speech as though it were an apartment in Babel, tried to discourse to him of its divers tenantry.  <br><br>  A polychromatic rug like some brilliant-flowered rectangular, tropical islet lay surrounded by a billowy sea of soiled matting. Upon the gay-papered wall were those pictures that pursue the homeless one from house to house--The Huguenot Lovers, The First Quarrel, The Wedding Breakfast, Psyche at the Fountain. The mantel's chastely severe outline was ingloriously veiled behind some pert drapery drawn rakishly askew like the sashes of the Amazonian ballet. Upon it was some desolate flotsam cast aside by the room's marooned when a lucky sail had borne them to a fresh port--a trifling vase or two, pictures of actresses, a medicine bottle, some stray cards out of a deck.  <br><br>  One by one, as the characters of a cryptograph become explicit, the little signs left by the furnished room's procession of guests developed a significance. The threadbare space in the rug in front of the dresser told that lovely woman had marched in the throng. Tiny finger prints on the wall spoke of little prisoners trying to feel their way to sun and air. A splattered stain, raying like the shadow of a bursting bomb, witnessed where a hurled glass or bottle had splintered with its contents against the wall. Across the pier glass had been scrawled with a diamond in staggering letters the name ""Marie."" It seemed that the succession of dwellers in the furnished room had turned in fury--perhaps tempted beyond forbearance by its garish coldness--and wreaked upon it their passions. The furniture was chipped and bruised; the couch, distorted by bursting springs, seemed a horrible monster that had been slain during the stress of some grotesque convulsion. Some more potent upheaval had cloven a great slice from the marble mantel. Each plank in the floor owned its particular cant and shriek as from a separate and individual agony. It seemed incredible that all this malice and injury had been wrought upon the room by those who had called it for a time their home; and yet it may have been the cheated home instinct surviving blindly, the resentful rage at false household gods that had kindled their wrath. A hut that is our own we can sweep and adorn and cherish.  <br><br>  The young tenant in the chair allowed these thoughts to file, soft- shod, through his mind, while there drifted into the room furnished sounds and furnished scents. He heard in one room a tittering and incontinent, slack laughter; in others the monologue of a scold, the rattling of dice, a lullaby, and one crying dully; above him a banjo tinkled with spirit. Doors banged somewhere; the elevated trains roared intermittently; a cat yowled miserably upon a back fence. And he breathed the breath of the house--a dank savour rather than a smell --a cold, musty effluvium as from underground vaults mingled with the reeking exhalations of linoleum and mildewed and rotten woodwork.  <br><br>  Then, suddenly, as he rested there, the room was filled with the strong, sweet odour of mignonette. It came as upon a single buffet of wind with such sureness and fragrance and emphasis that it almost seemed a living visitant. And the man cried aloud: ""What, dear?"" as if he had been called, and sprang up and faced about. The rich odour clung to him and wrapped him around. He reached out his arms for it, all his senses for the time confused and commingled. How could one be peremptorily called by an odour? Surely it must have been a sound. But, was it not the sound that had touched, that had caressed him?  <br><br>  ""She has been in this room,"" he cried, and he sprang to wrest from it a token, for he knew he would recognize the smallest thing that had belonged to her or that she had touched. This enveloping scent of mignonette, the odour that she had loved and made her own--whence came it?  <br><br>  The room had been but carelessly set in order. Scattered upon the flimsy dresser scarf were half a dozen hairpins--those discreet, indistinguishable friends of womankind, feminine of gender, infinite of mood and uncommunicative of tense. These he ignored, conscious of their triumphant lack of identity. Ransacking the drawers of the dresser he came upon a discarded, tiny, ragged handkerchief. He pressed it to his face. It was racy and insolent with heliotrope; he hurled it to the floor. In another drawer he found odd buttons, a theatre programme, a pawnbroker's card, two lost marshmallows, a book on the divination of dreams. In the last was a woman's black satin hair bow, which halted him, poised between ice and fire. But the black satin hairbow also is femininity's demure, impersonal, common ornament, and tells no tales.  <br><br>  And then he traversed the room like a hound on the scent, skimming the walls, considering the corners of the bulging matting on his hands and knees, rummaging mantel and tables, the curtains and hangngs, the drunken cabinet in the corner, for a visible sign, unable to perceive that she was there beside, around, against, within, above him, clinging to him, wooing him, calling him so poignantly through the finer senses that even his grosser ones became cognisant of the call. Once again he answered loudly: ""Yes, dear!"" and turned, wild-eyed, to gaze on vacancy, for he could not yet discern form and colour and love and outstretched arms in the odour of mnignonette. Oh, God! whence that odour, and since when have odours had a voice to call? Thus he groped.  <br><br>  He burrowed in crevices and corners, and found corks and cigarettes. These he passed in passive contempt. But once he found in a fold of the matting a half-smoked cigar, and this he ground beneath his heel with a green and trenchant oath. He sifted the room from end to end. He found dreary and ignoble small records of many a peripatetic tenant; but of her whom he sought, and who may have lodged there, and whose spirit seemed to hover there, he found no trace.  <br><br>  And then he thought of the housekeeper.  <br><br>  He ran from the haunted room downstairs and to a door that showed a crack of light. She came out to his knock. He smothered his excitement as best he could.  <br><br>  ""Will you tell me, madam,"" he besought her, ""who occupied the room I have before I came?""  <br><br>  ""Yes, sir. I can tell you again. 'Twas Sprowls and Mooney, as I said. Miss B'retta Sprowls it was in the theatres, but Missis Mooney she was. My house is well known for respectability. The marriage certificate hung, framed, on a nail over--""  <br><br>  ""What kind of a lady was Miss Sprowls--in looks, I mean?""  <br><br>  Why, black-haired, sir, short, and stout, with a comical face. They left a week ago Tuesday.""  <br><br>  ""And before they occupied it?""  <br><br>  ""Why, there was a single gentleman connected with the draying business. He left owing me a week. Before him was Missis Crowder and her two children, that stayed four months; and back of them was old Mr. Doyle, whose sons paid for him. He kept the room six months. That goes back a year, sir, and further I do not remember.""  <br><br>  He thanked her and crept back to his room. The room was dead. The essence that had vivified it was gone. The perfume of mignonette had departed. In its place was the old, stale odour of mouldy house furniture, of atmosphere in storage.  <br><br>  The ebbing of his hope drained his faith. He sat staring at the yellow, singing gaslight. Soon he walked to the bed and began to tear the sheets into strips. With the blade of his knife he drove them tightly into every crevice around windows and door. When all was snug and taut he turned out the light, turned the gas full on again and laid himself gratefully upon the bed.  <br><br>  * * * * * * *  <br><br>  It was Mrs. McCool's night to go with the can for beer. So she fetched it and sat with Mrs. Purdy in one of those subterranean retreats where house-keepers foregather and the worm dieth seldom.  <br><br>  ""I rented out my third floor, back, this evening,"" said Mrs. Purdy, across a fine circle of foam. ""A young man took it. He went up to bed two hours ago.""  <br><br>  ""Now, did ye, Mrs. Purdy, ma'am?"" said Mrs. McCool, with intense admiration. ""You do be a wonder for rentin' rooms of that kind. And did ye tell him, then?"" she concluded in a husky whisper, laden with mystery.  <br><br>  ""Rooms,"" said Mrs. Purdy, in her furriest tones, ""are furnished for to rent. I did not tell him, Mrs. McCool.""  <br><br>  ""'Tis right ye are, ma'am; 'tis by renting rooms we kape alive. Ye have the rale sense for business, ma'am. There be many people will rayjict the rentin' of a room if they be tould a suicide has been after dyin' in the bed of it.""  <br><br>  ""As you say, we has our living to be making,"" remarked Mrs. Purdy.  <br><br>  ""Yis, ma'am; 'tis true. 'Tis just one wake ago this day I helped ye lay out the third floor, back. A pretty slip of a colleen she was to be killin' herself wid the gas--a swate little face she had, Mrs. Purdy, ma'am.""  <br><br>  ""She'd a-been called handsome, as you say,"" said Mrs. Purdy, assenting but critical, ""but for that mole she had a-growin' by her left eyebrow. Do fill up your glass again, Mrs. McCool.""  <br><br>"
89,The Gift Of The Magi,"  ONE DOLLAR AND EIGHTY-SEVEN CENTS. THAT WAS ALL. AND SIXTY CENTS of it was in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one's cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied. Three times Della counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas.  <br><br>  There was clearly nothing left to do but flop down on the shabby little couch and howl. So Della did it. Which instigates the moral reflection that life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles predominating.  <br><br>  While the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the first stage to the second, take a look at the home. A furnished flat at $8 per week. It did not exactly beggar description, but it certainly had that word on the look-out for the mendicancy squad.  <br><br>  In the vestibule below was a letter-box into which no letter would go, and an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax a ring. Also appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the name ""Mr. James Dillingham Young.""  <br><br>  The ""Dillingham"" had been flung to the breeze during a former period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid $30 per week. Now, when the income was shrunk to $20, the letters of ""Dillingham"" looked blurred, as though they were thinking seriously of contracting to a modest and unassuming D. But whenever Mr. James Dillingham Young came home and reached his flat above he was called ""Jim"" and greatly hugged by Mrs. James Dillingham Young, already introduced to you as Della. Which is all very good.  <br><br>  Della finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag. She stood by the window and looked out dully at a grey cat walking a grey fence in a grey backyard. To-morrow would be Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a present. She had been saving every penny she could for months, with this result. Twenty dollars a week doesn't go far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated. They always are. Only $1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him. Something fine and rare and sterling--something just a little bit near to being worthy of the honour of being owned by Jim.  <br><br>  There was a pier-glass between the windows of the room. Perhaps you have seen a pier-glass in an $8 Bat. A very thin and very agile person may, by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips, obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks. Della, being slender, had mastered the art.  <br><br>  Suddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass. Her eyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its colour within twenty seconds. Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length.  <br><br>  Now, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in which they both took a mighty pride. One was Jim's gold watch that had been his father's and his grandfather's. The other was Della's hair. Had the Queen of Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang out of the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty's jewels and gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in the basement, Jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from envy.  <br><br>  So now Della's beautiful hair fell about her, rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters. It reached below her knee and made itself almost a garment for her. And then she did it up again nervously and quickly. Once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet.  <br><br>  On went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat. With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes, she cluttered out of the door and down the stairs to the street.  <br><br>  Where she stopped the sign read: ""Mme Sofronie. Hair Goods of All Kinds."" One Eight up Della ran, and collected herself, panting. Madame, large, too white, chilly, hardly looked the ""Sofronie.""  <br><br>  ""Will you buy my hair?"" asked Della.  <br><br>  ""I buy hair,"" said Madame. ""Take yer hat off and let's have a sight at the looks of it.""  <br><br>  Down rippled the brown cascade.  <br><br>  ""Twenty dollars,"" said Madame, lifting the mass with a practised hand.  <br><br>  ""Give it to me quick"" said Della.  <br><br>  Oh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget the hashed metaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim's present.  <br><br>  She found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else. There was no other like it in any of the stores, and she had turned all of them inside out. It was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design, properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation--as all good things should do. It was even worthy of The Watch. As soon as she saw it she knew that it must be Jim's. It was like him. Quietness and value--the description applied to both. Twenty-one dollars they took from her for it, and she hurried home with the 78 cents. With that chain on his watch Jim might be properly anxious about the time in any company. Grand as the watch was, he sometimes looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he used in place of a chain.  <br><br>  When Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence and reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love. Which is always a tremendous task dear friends--a mammoth task.  <br><br>  Within forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls that made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy. She looked at her reflection in the mirror long, carefully, and critically.  <br><br>  ""If Jim doesn't kill me,"" she said to herself, ""before he takes a second look at me, he'll say I look like a Coney Island chorus girl. But what could I do--oh! what could I do with a dollar and eighty-seven cents?""  <br><br>  At 7 o'clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on the back of the stove hot and ready to cook the chops.  <br><br>  Jim was never late. Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on the corner of the table near the door that he always entered. Then she heard his step on the stair away down on the first flight, and she turned white for just a moment. She had a habit of saying little silent prayers about the simplest everyday things, and now she whispered: ""Please, God, make him think I am still pretty.""  <br><br>  The door opened and Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked thin and very serious. Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two--and to be burdened with a family! He needed a new overcoat and he was with out gloves.  <br><br>  Jim stepped inside the door, as immovable as a setter at the scent of quail. His eyes were fixed upon Della, and there was an expression in them that she could not read, and it terrified her. It was not anger, nor surprise, nor disapproval, nor horror, nor any of the sentiments that she had been prepared for. He simply stared at her fixedly with that peculiar expression on his face.  <br><br>  Della wriggled off the table and went for him.  <br><br>  ""Jim, darling,"" she cried, ""don't look at me that way. I had my hair cut off and sold it because I couldn't have lived through Christmas without giving you a present. It'll grow out again--you won't mind, will you? I just had to do it. My hair grows awfully fast. Say 'Merry Christmas!' Jim, and let's be happy. You don't know what a nice-what a beautiful, nice gift I've got for you.""  <br><br>  ""You've cut off your hair?"" asked Jim, laboriously, as if he had not arrived at that patent fact yet, even after the hardest mental labour.  <br><br>  ""Cut it off and sold it,"" said Della. ""Don't you like me just as well, anyhow? I'm me without my hair, ain't I?""  <br><br>  Jim looked about the room curiously.  <br><br>  ""You say your hair is gone?"" he said, with an air almost of idiocy.  <br><br>  ""You needn't look for it,"" said Della. ""It's sold, I tell you--sold and gone, too. It's Christmas Eve, boy. Be good to me, for it went for you. Maybe the hairs of my head were numbered,"" she went on with a sudden serious sweetness, ""but nobody could ever count my love for you. Shall I put the chops on, Jim?""  <br><br>  Out of his trance Jim seemed quickly to wake. He enfolded his Della. For ten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in the other direction. Eight dollars a week or a million a year--what is the difference? A mathematician or a wit would give you the wrong answer. The magi brought valuable gifts, but that was not among them. I his dark assertion will be illuminated later on.  <br><br>  Jim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it upon the table.  <br><br>  ""Don't make any mistake, Dell,"" he said, ""about me. I don't think there's anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that could make me like my girl any less. But if you'll unwrap that package you may see why you had me going a while at first.""  <br><br>  White fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper. And then an ecstatic scream of joy; and then, alas! a quick feminine change to hysterical tears and wails, necessitating the immediate employment of all the comforting powers of the lord of the flat.  <br><br>  For there lay The Combs--the set of combs, side and back, that Della had worshipped for long in a Broadway window. Beautiful combs, pure tortoise-shell, with jewelled rims--just the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair. They were expensive combs, she knew, and her heart had simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of possession. And now, they were hers, but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone.  <br><br>  But she hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able to look up with dim eyes and a smile and say: ""My hair grows so fast, Jim!""  <br><br>  And then Della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried, ""Oh, oh!""  <br><br>  Jim had not yet seen his beautiful present. She held it out to him eagerly upon her open palm. The dull precious metal seemed to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit.  <br><br>  ""Isn't it a dandy, Jim? I hunted all over town to find it. You'll have to look at the time a hundred times a day now. Give me your watch. I want to see how it looks on it.""  <br><br>  Instead of obeying, Jim tumbled down on the couch and put his hands under the back of his head and smiled.  <br><br>  ""Dell,"" said he, ""let's put our Christmas presents away and keep 'em a while. They're too nice to use just at present. I sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs. And now suppose you put the chops on.""  <br><br>  The magi, as you know, were wise men--wonderfully wise men-who brought gifts to the Babe in the manger. They invented the art of giving Christmas presents. Being wise, their gifts were no doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication. And here I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house. But in a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest. Of all who give and receive gifts, such as they are wisest. Everywhere they are wisest. They are the magi.                             <br><br>"
90,The Green Door,"  Suppose you should be walking down Broadway after dinner, with ten minutes allotted to the consummation of your cigar while you are choosing between a diverting tragedy and something serious in the way of vaudeville. Suddenly a hand is laid upon your arm. You turn to look into the thrilling eyes of a beautiful woman, wonderful in diamonds and Russian sables. She thrusts hurriedly into your hand an extremely hot buttered roll, flashes out a tiny pair of scissors, snips off the second button of your overcoat, meaningly ejaculates the one word, ""parallelogram!"" and swiftly flies down a cross street, looking back fearfully over her shoulder.  <br><br>  That would be pure adventure. Would you accept it? Not you. You would flush with embarrassment; you would sheepishly drop the roll and continue down Broadway, fumbling feebly for the missing button. This you would do unless you are one of the blessed few in whom the pure spirit of adventure is not dead.  <br><br>  True adventurers have never been plentiful. They who are set down in print as such have been mostly business men with newly invented methods. They have been out after the things they wanted--golden fleeces, holy grails, lady loves, treasure, crowns and fame. The true adventurer goes forth aimless and uncalculating to meet and greet unknown fate. A fine example was the Prodigal Son--when he started back home.  <br><br>  Half-adventurers--brave and splendid figures--have been numerous. From the Crusades to the Palisades they have enriched the arts of history and fiction and the trade of historical fiction. But each of them had a prize to win, a goal to kick, an axe to grind, a race to run, a new thrust in tierce to deliver, a name to carve, a crow to pick--so they were not followers of true adventure.  <br><br>  In the big city the twin spirits Romance and Adventure are always abroad seeking worthy wooers. As we roam the streets they slyly peep at us and challenge us in twenty different guises. Without knowing why, we look up suddenly to see in a window a face that seems to belong to our gallery of intimate portraits; in a sleeping thoroughfare we hear a cry of agony and fear coming from an empty and shuttered house; instead of at our familiar curb, a cab-driver deposits us before a strange door, which one, with a smile, opens for us and bids us enter; a slip of paper, written upon, flutters down to our feet from the high lattices of Chance; we exchange glances of instantaneous hate, affection and fear with hurrying strangers in the passing crowds; a sudden douse of rain--and our umbrella may be sheltering the daughter of the Full Moon and first cousin of the Sidereal System; at every corner handkerchiefs drop, fingers beckon, eyes besiege, and the lost, the lonely, the rapturous, the mysterious, the perilous, changing clues of adventure are slipped into our fingers. But few of us are willing to hold and follow them. We are grown stiff with the ramrod of convention down our backs. We pass on; and some day we come, at the end of a very dull life, to reflect that our romance has been a pallid thing of a marriage or two, a satin rosette kept in a safe-deposit drawer, and a lifelong feud with a steam radiator.  <br><br>  Rudolf Steiner was a true adventurer. Few were the evenings on which he did not go forth from his hall bedchamber in search of the unexpected and the egregious. The most interesting thing in life seemed to him to be what might lie just around the next corner. Sometimes his willingness to tempt fate led him into strange paths. Twice he had spent the night in a station-house; again and again he had found himself the dupe of ingenious and mercenary tricksters; his watch and money had been the price of one flattering allurement. But with undiminished ardour he picked up every glove cast before him into the merry lists of adventure.  <br><br>  One evening Rudolf was strolling along a crosstown street in the older central part of the city. Two streams of people filled the sidewalks--the home-hurrying, and that restless contingent that abandons home for the specious welcome of the thousand-candle-power table d'hote.  <br><br>  The young adventurer was of pleasing presence, and moved serenely and watchfully. By daylight he was a salesman in a piano store. He wore his tie drawn through a topaz ring instead of fastened with a stick pin; and once he had written to the editor of a magazine that ""Junie's Love Test"" by Miss Libbey, had been the book that had most influenced his life.  <br><br>  During his walk a violent chattering of teeth in a glass case on the sidewalk seemed at first to draw his attention (with a qualm), to a restaurant before which it was set; but a second glance revealed the electric letters of a dentist's sign high above the next door. A giant negro, fantastically dressed in a red embroidered coat, yellow trousers and a military cap, discreetly distributed cards to those of the passing crowd who consented to take them.  <br><br>  This mode of dentistic advertising was a common sight to Rudolf. Usually he passed the dispenser of the dentist's cards without reducing his store; but tonight the African slipped one into his hand so deftly that he retained it there smiling a little at the successful feat.  <br><br>  When he had travelled a few yards further he glanced at the card indifferently. Surprised, he turned it over and looked again with interest. One side of the card was blank; on the other was written in ink three words, ""The Green Door."" And then Rudolf saw, three steps in front of him, a man throw down the card the negro had given him as he passed. Rudolf picked it up. It was printed with the dentist's name and address and the usual schedule of ""plate work"" and ""bridge work"" and specious promises of ""painless"" operations.  <br><br>  The adventurous piano salesman halted at the corner and considered. Then he crossed the street, walked down a block, recrossed and joined the upward current of people again. Without seeming to notice the negro as he passed the second time, he carelessly took the card that was handed him. Ten steps away he inspected it. In the same handwriting that appeared on the first card ""The Green Door"" was inscribed upon it. Three or four cards were tossed to the pavement by pedestrians both following and leading him. These fell blank side up. Rudolf turned them over. Every one bore the printed legend of the dental ""parlours.""  <br><br>  Rarely did the arch sprite Adventure need to beckon twice to Rudolf Steiner, his true follower. But twice it had been done, and the quest was on.  <br><br>  Rudolf walked slowly back to where the giant negro stood by the case of rattling teeth. This time as he passed he received no card. In spite of his gaudy and ridiculous garb, the Ethiopian displayed a natural barbaric dignity as he stood, offering the cards suavely to some, allowing others to pass unmolested. Every half minute he chanted a harsh, unintelligible phrase akin to the jabber of car conductors and grand opera. And not only did he withhold a card this time, but it seemed to Rudolf that he received from the shining and massive black countenance a look of cold, almost contemptuous disdain.  <br><br>  The look stung the adventurer. He read in it a silent accusation that he had been found wanting. Whatever the mysterious written words on the cards might mean, the black had selected him twice from the throng for their recipient; and now seemed to have condemned him as deficient in the wit and spirit to engage the enigma.  <br><br>  Standing aside from the rush, the young man made a rapid estimate of the building in which he conceived that his adventure must lie. Five stories high it rose. A small restaurant occupied the basement.  <br><br>  The first floor, now closed, seemed to house millinery or furs. The second floor, by the winking electric letters, was the dentist's. Above this a polyglot babel of signs struggled to indicate the abodes of palmists, dressmakers, musicians and doctors. Still higher up draped curtains and milk bottles white on the window sills proclaimed the regions of domesticity.  <br><br>  After concluding his survey Rudolf walked briskly up the high flight of stone steps into the house. Up two flights of the carpeted stairway he continued; and at its top paused. The hallway there was dimly lighted by two pale jets of gas one--far to his right, the other nearer, to his left. He looked toward the nearer light and saw, within its wan halo, a green door. For one moment he hesitated; then he seemed to see the contumelious sneer of the African juggler of cards; and then he walked straight to the green door and knocked against it.  <br><br>  Moments like those that passed before his knock was answered measure the quick breath of true adventure. What might not be behind those green panels! Gamesters at play; cunning rogues baiting their traps with subtle skill; beauty in love with courage, and thus planning to be sought by it; danger, death, love, disappointment, ridicule--any of these might respond to that temerarious rap.  <br><br>  A faint rustle was heard inside, and the door slowly opened. A girl not yet twenty stood there, white-faced and tottering. She loosed the knob and swayed weakly, groping with one hand. Rudolf caught her and laid her on a faded couch that stood against the wall. He closed the door and took a swift glance around the room by the light of a flickering gas jet. Neat, but extreme poverty was the story that he read.  <br><br>  The girl lay still, as if in a faint. Rudolf looked around the room excitedly for a barrel. People must be rolled upon a barrel who--no, no; that was for drowned persons. He began to fan her with his hat. That was successful, for he struck her nose with the brim of his derby and she opened her eyes. And then the young man saw that hers, indeed, was the one missing face from his heart's gallery of intimate portraits. The frank, grey eyes, the little nose, turning pertly outward; the chestnut hair, curling like the tendrils of a pea vine, seemed the right end and reward of all his wonderful adventures. But the face was wofully thin and pale.  <br><br>  The girl looked at him calmly, and then smiled.  <br><br>  ""Fainted, didn't I?"" she asked, weakly. ""Well, who wouldn't? You try going without anything to eat for three days and see!""  <br><br>  ""Himmel!"" exclaimed Rudolf, jumping up. ""Wait till I come back.""  <br><br>  He dashed out the green door and down the stairs. In twenty minutes he was back again, kicking at the door with his toe for her to open it. With both arms he hugged an array of wares from the grocery and the restaurant. On the table he laid them--bread and butter, cold meats, cakes, pies, pickles, oysters, a roasted chicken, a bottle of milk and one of redhot tea.  <br><br>  ""This is ridiculous,"" said Rudolf, blusteringly, ""to go without eating. You must quit making election bets of this kind. Supper is ready."" He helped her to a chair at the table and asked: ""Is there a cup for the tea?"" ""On the shelf by the window,"" she answered. When he turned again with the cup he saw her, with eyes shining rapturously, beginning upon a huge Dill pickle that she had rooted out from the paper bags with a woman's unerring instinct. He took it from her, laughingly, and poured the cup full of milk. ""Drink that first"" he ordered, ""and then you shall have some tea, and then a chicken wing. If you are very good you shall have a pickle to-morrow. And now, if you'll allow me to be your guest we'll have supper.""  <br><br>  He drew up the other chair. The tea brightened the girl's eyes and brought back some of her colour. She began to eat with a sort of dainty ferocity like some starved wild animal. She seemcd to regard the young man's presence and the aid he had rendered her as a natural thing--not as though she undervalued the conventions; but as one whose great stress gave her the right to put aside the artificial for the human. But gradually, with the return of strength and comfort, came also a sense of the little conventions that belong; and she began to tell him her little story. It was one of a thousand such as the city yawns at every day--the shop girl's story of insufficient wages, further reduced by ""fines"" that go to swell the store's profits; of time lost through illness; and then of lost positions, lost hope, and--the knock of the adventurer upon the green door.  <br><br>  But to Rudolf the history sounded as big as the Iliad or the crisis in ""Junie's Love Test.""  <br><br>  ""To think of you going through all that,"" he exclaimed.  <br><br>  ""It was something fierce,"" said the girl, solemnly.  <br><br>  ""And you have no relatives or friends in the city?""  <br><br>  ""None whatever.""  <br><br>  ""I am all alone in the world, too,"" said Rudolf, after a pause.  <br><br>  ""I am glad of that,"" said the girl, promptly; and somehow it pleased the young man to hear that she approved of his bereft condition.  <br><br>  Very suddenly her eyelids dropped and she sighed deeply.  <br><br>  ""I'm awfully sleepy,"" she said, ""and I feel so good.""  <br><br>  Then Rudolf rose and took his hat. ""I'll say good-night. A long night's sleep will be fine for you.""  <br><br>  He held out his hand, and she took it and said ""good-night."" But her eyes asked a question so eloquently, so frankly and pathetically that he answered it with words.  <br><br>  ""Oh, I'm coming back to-morrow to see how you are getting along. You can't get rid of me so easily.""  <br><br>  Then, at the door, as though the way of his coming had been so much less important than the fact that he had come, she asked: ""How did you come to knock at my door?""  <br><br>  He looked at her for a moment, remembering the cards, and felt a sudden jealous pain. What if they had fallen into other hands as adventurous as his? Quickly he decided that she must never know the truth. He would never let her know that he was aware of the strange expedient to which she had been driven by her great distress.  <br><br>  ""One of our piano tuners lives in this house,"" he said. ""I knocked at your door by mistake.""  <br><br>  The last thing he saw in the room before the green door closed was her smile.  <br><br>  At the head of the stairway he paused and looked curiously about him. And then he went along the hallway to its other end; and, coming back, ascended to the floor above and continued his puzzled explorations. Every door that he found in the house was painted green.  <br><br>  Wondering, he descended to the sidewalk. The fantastic African was still there. Rudolf confronted him with his two cards in his hand.  <br><br>  ""Will you tell me why you gave me these cards and what they mean?"" he asked.  <br><br>  In a broad, good-natured grin the negro exhibited a splendid advertisement of his master's profession.  <br><br>  ""Dar it is, boss,"" he said, pointing down the street. ""But I 'spect you is a little late for de fust act.""  <br><br>  Looking the way he pointed Rudolf saw above the entrance to a theatre the blazing electric sign of its new play, ""The Green Door.""  <br><br>  ""I'm informed dat it's a fust-rate show, sah,"" said the negro. ""De agent what represents it pussented me with a dollar, sah, to distribute a few of his cards along with de doctah's. May I offer you one of de doctah's cards, sah?""  <br><br>  At the corner of the block in which he lived Rudolf stopped for a glass of beer and a cigar. When he had come out with his lighted weed he buttoned his coat, pushed back his hat and said, stoutly, to the lamp post on the corner:  <br><br>  ""All the same, I believe it was the hand of Fate that doped out the way for me to find her.""  <br><br>  Which conclusion, under the circumstances, certainly admits Rudolf Steiner to the ranks of the true followers of Romance and Adventure.  <br><br>"
91,The Indian Summer Of Dry Valley Johnson,"Dry Valley Johnson shook the bottle. You have to shake the bottle before using; for sulphur will not dissolve. Then Dry Valley saturated a small sponge with the liquid and rubbed it carefully into the roots of his hair. Besides sulphur there was sugar of lead in it and tincture of nux vomica and bay rum. Dry Valley found the recipe in a Sunday newspaper. You must next be told why a strong man came to fall a victim to a Beauty Hint.<br><br>    Dry Valley had been a sheepman. His real name was Hector, but he had been rechristened after his range to distinguish him from ""Elm Creek"" Johnson, who ran sheep further down the Frio.<br><br>    Many years of living face to face with sheep on their own terms wearied Dry Valley Johnson. So, he sold his ranch for eighteen thousand dollars and moved to Santa Rosa to live a life of gentlemanly ease. Being a silent and melancholy person of thirty-five--or perhaps thirty-eight--he soon became that cursed and earth-cumbering thing--an elderlyish bachelor with a hobby. Some one gave him his first strawberry to eat, and he was done for.<br><br>    Dry Valley bought a four-room cottage in the village, and a library on strawberry culture. Behind the cottage was a garden of which he made a strawberry patch. In his old grey woolen shirt, his brown duck trousers, and high-heeled boots he sprawled all day on a canvas cot under a live-oak tree at his back door studying the history of the seductive, scarlet berry.<br><br>    The school teacher, Miss De Witt, spoke of him as ""a fine, presentable man, for all his middle age."" But, the focus of Dry Valley's eyes embraced no women. They were merely beings who flew skirts as a signal for him to lift awkwardly his heavy, round-crowned, broad-brimmed felt Stetson whenever he met them, and then hurry past to get back to his beloved berries.<br><br>    And all this recitative by the chorus is only to bring us to the point where you may be told why Dry Valley shook up the insoluble sulphur in the bottle. So long-drawn and inconsequential a thing is history--the anamorphous shadow of a milestone reaching down the road between us and the setting sun.<br><br>    When his strawberries were beginning to ripen Dry Valley bought the heaviest buggy whip in the Santa Rosa store. He sat for many hours under the live oak tree plaiting and weaving in an extension to its lash. When it was done he could snip a leaf from a bush twenty feet away with the cracker. For the bright, predatory eyes of Santa Rosa youth were watching the ripening berries, and Dry Valley was arming himself against their expected raids. No greater care had he taken of his tender lambs during his ranching days than he did of his cherished fruit, warding it from the hungry wolves that whistled and howled and shot their marbles and peered through the fence that surrounded his property.<br><br>    In the house next to Dry Valley's lived a widow with a pack of children that gave the husbandman frequent anxious misgivings. In the woman there was a strain of the Spanish. She had wedded one of the name of O'Brien. Dry Valley was a connoisseur in cross strains; and he foresaw trouble in the offspring of this union.<br><br>    Between the two homesteads ran a crazy picket fence overgrown with morning glory and wild gourd vines. Often he could see little heads with mops of black hair and flashing dark eyes dodging in and out between the pickets, keeping tabs on the reddening berries.<br><br>    Late one afternoon Dry Valley went to the post office. When he came back, like Mother Hubbard he found the deuce to pay. The descendants of Iberian bandits and Hibernian cattle raiders had swooped down upon his strawberry patch. To the outraged vision of Dry Valley there seemed to be a sheep corral full of them; perhaps they numbered five or six. Between the rows of green plants they were stooped, hopping about like toads, gobbling silently and voraciously his finest fruit.<br><br>    Dry Valley slipped into the house, got his whip, and charged the marauders. The lash curled about the legs of the nearest--a greedy ten-year-old--before they knew they were discovered. His screech gave warning; and the flock scampered for the fence like a drove of javelis flushed in the chaparral. Dry Valley's whip drew a toll of two more elfin shrieks before they dived through the vine-clad fence and disappeared.<br><br>    Dry Valley, less fleet, followed them nearly to the pickets. Checking his useless pursuit, he rounded a bush, dropped his whip and stood, voiceless, motionless, the capacity of his powers consumed by the act of breathing and preserving the perpendicular.<br><br>    Behind the bush stood Panchita O'Brien, scorning to fly. She was nineteen, the oldest of the raiders. Her night-black hair was gathered back in a wild mass and tied with a scarlet ribbon. She stood, with reluctant feet, yet nearer the brook than to the river; for childhood had environed and detained her.<br><br>    She looked at Dry Valley Johnson for a moment with magnificent insolence, and before his eyes slowly crunched a luscious berry between her white teeth. Then she turned and walked slowly to the fence with a swaying, conscious motion, such as a duchess might make use of in leading a promenade. There she turned again and grilled Dry Valley Johnson once more in the dark flame of her audacious eyes, laughed a trifle school-girlishly, and twisted herself with pantherish quickness between the pickets to the O'Brien side of the wild gourd vine.<br><br>    Dry Valley picked up his whip and went into his house. He stumbled as he went up the two wooden steps. The old Mexican woman who cooked his meals and swept his house called him to supper as he went through the rooms. Dry Valley went on, stumbled down the front steps, out the gate and down the road into a mesquite thicket at the edge of town. He sat down in the grass and laboriously plucked the spines from a prickly pear, one by one. This was his attitude of thought, acquired in the days when his problems were only those of wind and wool and water.<br><br>    A thing had happened to the man--a thing that, if you are eligible, you must pray may pass you by. He had become enveloped in the Indian Summer of the Soul.<br><br>    Dry Valley had had no youth. Even his childhood had been one of dignity and seriousness. At six he had viewed the frivolous gambols of the lambs on his father's ranch with silent disapproval. His life as a young man had been wasted. The divine fires and impulses, the glorious exaltations and despairs, the glow and enchantment of youth had passed above his head. Never a thrill of Romeo had he known; he was but a melancholy Jaques of the forest with a ruder philosophy, lacking the bitter-sweet flavour of experience that tempered the veteran years of the rugged ranger of Arden. And now in his sere and yellow leaf one scornful look from the eyes of Panchita O'Brien had flooded the autumnal landscape with a tardy and delusive summer heat.<br><br>    But a sheepman is a hardy animal. Dry Valley Johnson had weathered too many northers to turn his back on a late summer, spiritual or real. Old? He would show them.<br><br>    By the next mail went an order to San Antonio for an outfit of the latest clothes, colours and styles and prices no object. The next day went the recipe for the hair restorer clipped from a newspaper; for Dry Valley's sunburned auburn hair was beginning to turn silvery above his ears.<br><br>    Dry Valley kept indoors closely for a week except for frequent sallies after youthful strawberry snatchers. Then, a few days later, he suddenly emerged brilliantly radiant in the hectic glow of his belated midsummer madness.<br><br>    A jay-bird-blue tennis suit covered him outwardly, almost as far as his wrists and ankles. His shirt was ox-blood; his collar winged and tall; his necktie a floating oriflamme; his shoes a venomous bright tan, pointed and shaped on penitential lasts. A little flat straw hat with a striped band desecrated his weather-beaten head. Lemon-coloured kid gloves protected his oak-tough hands from the benignant May sunshine. This sad and optic-smiting creature teetered out of its den, smiling foolishly and smoothing its gloves for men and angels to see. To such a pass had Dry Valley Johnson been brought by Cupid, who always shoots game that is out of season with an arrow from the quiver of Momus. Reconstructing mythology, he had risen, a prismatic macaw, from the ashes of the grey-brown phoenix that had folded its tired wings to roost under the trees of Santa Rosa.<br><br>    Dry Valley paused in the street to allow Santa Rosans within sight of him to be stunned; and then deliberately and slowly, as his shoes required, entered Mrs. O'Brien's gate.<br><br>    Not until the eleven months' drought did Santa Rosa cease talking about Dry Valley Johnson's courtship of Panchita O'Brien. It was an unclassifiable procedure; something like a combination of cake- walking, deaf-and-dumb oratory, postage stamp flirtation and parlour charades. It lasted two weeks and then came to a sudden end.<br><br>    Of course Mrs. O'Brien favoured the match as soon as Dry Valley's intentions were disclosed. Being the mother of a woman child, and therefore a charter member of the Ancient Order of the Rat-trap, she joyfully decked out Panchita for the sacrifice. The girl was temporarily dazzled by having her dresses lengthened and her hair piled up on her head, and came near forgetting that she was only a slice of cheese. It was nice, too, to have as good a match as Mr. Johnson paying you attentions and to see the other girls fluttering the curtains at their windows to see you go by with him.<br><br>    Dry Valley bought a buggy with yellow wheels and a fine trotter in San Antonio. Every day he drove out with Panchita. He was never seen to speak to her when they were walking or driving. The consciousness of his clothes kept his mind busy; the knowledge that he could say nothing of interest kept him dumb; the feeling that Panchita was there kept him happy.<br><br>    He took her to parties and dances, and to church. He tried--oh, no man ever tried so hard to be young as Dry Valley did. He could not dance; but he invented a smile which he wore on these joyous occasions, a smile that, in him, was as great a concession to mirth and gaiety as turning hand-springs would be in another. He began to seek the company of the young men in the town--even of the boys. They accepted him as a decided damper, for his attempts at sportiveness were so forced that they might as well have essayed their games in a cathedral. Neither he nor any other could estimate what progress he had made with Panchita.<br><br>    The end came suddenly in one day, as often disappears the false afterglow before a November sky and wind.<br><br>    Dry Valley was to call for the girl one afternoon at six for a walk. An afternoon walk in Santa Rosa was a feature of social life that called for the pink of one's wardrobe. So Dry Valley began gorgeously to array himself; and so early that he finished early, and went over to the O'Brien cottage. As he neared the porch on the crooked walk from the gate he heard sounds of revelry within. He stopped and looked through the honeysuckle vines in the open door.<br><br>    Panchita was amusing her younger brothers and sisters. She wore a man's clothes--no doubt those of the late Mr. O'Brien. On her head was the smallest brother's straw hat decorated with an ink-striped paper band. On her hands were flapping yellow cloth gloves, roughly cut out and sewn for the masquerade. The same material covered her shoes, giving them the semblance of tan leather. High collar and flowing necktie were not omitted.<br><br>    Panchita was an actress. Dry Valley saw his affectedly youthful gait, his limp where the right shoe hurt him, his forced smile, his awkward simulation of a gallant air, all reproduced with startling fidelity. For the first time a mirror had been held up to him. The corroboration of one of the youngsters calling, ""Mamma, come and see Pancha do like Mr. Johnson,"" was not needed.<br><br>    As softly as the caricatured tans would permit, Dry Valley tiptoed back to the gate and home again.<br><br>    Twenty minutes after the time appointed for the walk Panchita tripped demurely out of her gate in a thin, trim white lawn and sailor hat. She strolled up the sidewalk and slowed her steps at Dry Valley's gate, her manner expressing wonder at his unusual delinquency.<br><br>    Then out of his door and down the walk strode--not the polychromatic victim of a lost summertime, but the sheepman, rehabilitated. He wore his old grey woolen shirt, open at the throat, his brown duck trousers stuffed into his run-over boots, and his white felt sombrero on the back of his head. Twenty years or fifty he might look; Dry Valley cared not. His light blue eyes met Panchita's dark ones with a cold flash in them. He came as far as the gate. He pointed with his long arm to her house.<br><br>    ""Go home,"" said Dry Valley. ""Go home to your mother. I wonder lightnin' don't strike a fool like me. Go home and play in the sand. What business have you got cavortin' around with grown men? I reckon I was locoed to be makin' a he poll-parrot out of myself for a kid like you. Go home and don't let me see you no more. Why I done it, will somebody tell me? Go home, and let me try and forget it.""<br><br>    Panchita obeyed and walked slowly toward her home, saying nothing. For some distance she kept her head turned and her large eyes fixed intrepidly upon Dry Valley's. At her gate she stood for a moment looking back at him, then ran suddenly and swiftly into the house.<br><br>    Old Antonia was building a fire in the kitchen stove. Dry Valley stopped at the door and laughed harshly.<br><br>    ""I'm a pretty looking old rhinoceros to be gettin' stuck on a kid, ain't I, 'Tonia?"" said he.<br><br>    ""Not verree good thing,"" agreed Antonia, sagely, ""for too much old man to likee muchacha.""<br><br>    ""You bet it ain't,"" said Dry Valley, grimly. ""It's dum foolishness; and, besides, it hurts.""<br><br>    He brought at one armful the regalia of his aberration--the blue tennis suit, shoes, hat, gloves and all, and threw them in a pile at Antonia's feet.<br><br>    ""Give them to your old man,"" said he, ""to hunt antelope in.""<br><br>    Just as the first star presided palely over the twilight Dry Valley got his biggest strawberry book and sat on the back steps to catch the last of the reading light. He thought he saw the figure of someone in his strawberry patch. He laid aside the book, got his whip and hurried forth to see.<br><br>    It was Panchita. She had slipped through the picket fence and was half-way across the patch. She stopped when she saw him and looked at him without wavering.<br><br>    A sudden rage--a humiliating flush of unreasoning wrath--came over Dry Valley. For this child he had made himself a motley to the view. He had tried to bribe Time to turn backward for himself; he had--been made a fool of. At last he had seen his folly. There was a gulf between him and youth over which he could not build a bridge even with yellow gloves to protect his hands. And the sight of his torment coming to pester him with her elfin pranks--coming to plunder his strawberry vines like a mischievous schoolboy--roused all his anger.<br><br>    ""I told you to keep away from here,"" said Dry Valley. ""Go back to your home.""<br><br>    Panchita moved slowly toward him.<br><br>    Dry Valley cracked his whip.<br><br>    ""Go back home,"" said Dry Valley, savagely, ""and play theatricals some more. You'd make a fine man. You've made a fine one of me.""<br><br>    She came a step nearer, silent, and with that strange, defiant, steady shine in her eyes that had always puzzled him. Now it stirred his wrath.<br><br>    His whiplash whistled through the air. He saw a red streak suddenly come out through her white dress above her knee where it had struck.<br><br>    Without flinching and with the same unchanging dark glow in her eyes, Panchita came steadily toward him through the strawberry vines. Dry Valley's trembling hand released his whip handle. When within a yard of him Panchita stretched out her arms.<br><br>    ""God, kid!"" stammered Dry Valley, ""do you mean--?""<br><br>    But the seasons are versatile; and it may have been Springtime, after all, instead of Indian Summer, that struck Dry Valley Johnson.                             <br><br>"
92,The Last Leaf,"In a little district west of Washington Square the streets have run crazy and broken themselves into small strips called ""places."" These ""places"" make strange angles and curves. One Street crosses itself a time or two. An artist once discovered a valuable possibility in this street. Suppose a collector with a bill for paints, paper and canvas should, in traversing this route, suddenly meet himself coming back, without a cent having been paid on account!  <br><br>  So, to quaint old Greenwich Village the art people soon came prowling, hunting for north windows and eighteenth-century gables and Dutch attics and low rents. Then they imported some pewter mugs and a chafing dish or two from Sixth Avenue, and became a ""colony.""  <br><br>  At the top of a squatty, three-story brick Sue and Johnsy had their studio. ""Johnsy"" was familiar for Joanna. One was from Maine; the other from California. They had met at the table d'hte of an Eighth Street ""Delmonico's,"" and found their tastes in art, chicory salad and bishop sleeves so congenial that the joint studio resulted.  <br><br>  That was in May. In November a cold, unseen stranger, whom the doctors called Pneumonia, stalked about the colony, touching one here and there with his icy fingers. Over on the east side this ravager strode boldly, smiting his victims by scores, but his feet trod slowly through the maze of the narrow and moss-grown ""places.""  <br><br>  Mr. Pneumonia was not what you would call a chivalric old gentleman. A mite of a little woman with blood thinned by California zephyrs was hardly fair game for the red-fisted, short-breathed old duffer. But Johnsy he smote; and she lay, scarcely moving, on her painted iron bedstead, looking through the small Dutch window-panes at the blank side of the next brick house.  <br><br>  One morning the busy doctor invited Sue into the hallway with a shaggy, gray eyebrow.  <br><br>  ""She has one chance in - let us say, ten,"" he said, as he shook down the mercury in his clinical thermometer. "" And that chance is for her to want to live. This way people have of lining-u on the side of the undertaker makes the entire pharmacopoeia look silly. Your little lady has made up her mind that she's not going to get well. Has she anything on her mind?""  <br><br>  ""She - she wanted to paint the Bay of Naples some day."" said Sue.  <br><br>  ""Paint? - bosh! Has she anything on her mind worth thinking twice - a man for instance?""  <br><br>  ""A man?"" said Sue, with a jew's-harp twang in her voice. ""Is a man worth - but, no, doctor; there is nothing of the kind.""  <br><br>  ""Well, it is the weakness, then,"" said the doctor. ""I will do all that science, so far as it may filter through my efforts, can accomplish. But whenever my patient begins to count the carriages in her funeral procession I subtract 50 per cent from the curative power of medicines. If you will get her to ask one question about the new winter styles in cloak sleeves I will promise you a one-in-five chance for her, instead of one in ten.""  <br><br>  After the doctor had gone Sue went into the workroom and cried a Japanese napkin to a pulp. Then she swaggered into Johnsy's room with her drawing board, whistling ragtime.  <br><br>  Johnsy lay, scarcely making a ripple under the bedclothes, with her face toward the window. Sue stopped whistling, thinking she was asleep.  <br><br>  She arranged her board and began a pen-and-ink drawing to illustrate a magazine story. Young artists must pave their way to Art by drawing pictures for magazine stories that young authors write to pave their way to Literature.  <br><br>  As Sue was sketching a pair of elegant horseshow riding trousers and a monocle of the figure of the hero, an Idaho cowboy, she heard a low sound, several times repeated. She went quickly to the bedside.  <br><br>  Johnsy's eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting - counting backward.  <br><br>  ""Twelve,"" she said, and little later ""eleven""; and then ""ten,"" and ""nine""; and then ""eight"" and ""seven"", almost together.  <br><br>  Sue look solicitously out of the window. What was there to count? There was only a bare, dreary yard to be seen, and the blank side of the brick house twenty feet away. An old, old ivy vine, gnarled and decayed at the roots, climbed half way up the brick wall. The cold breath of autumn had stricken its leaves from the vine until its skeleton branches clung, almost bare, to the crumbling bricks.  <br><br>  ""What is it, dear?"" asked Sue.  <br><br>  ""Six,"" said Johnsy, in almost a whisper. ""They're falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. It made my head ache to count them. But now it's easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now.""  <br><br>  ""Five what, dear? Tell your Sudie.""  <br><br>  ""Leaves. On the ivy vine. When the last one falls I must go, too. I've known that for three days. Didn't the doctor tell you?""  <br><br>  ""Oh, I never heard of such nonsense,"" complained Sue, with magnificent scorn. ""What have old ivy leaves to do with your getting well? And you used to love that vine so, you naughty girl. Don't be a goosey. Why, the doctor told me this morning that your chances for getting well real soon were - let's see exactly what he said - he said the chances were ten to one! Why, that's almost as good a chance as we have in New York when we ride on the street cars or walk past a new building. Try to take some broth now, and let Sudie go back to her drawing, so she can sell the editor man with it, and buy port wine for her sick child, and pork chops for her greedy self.""  <br><br>  ""You needn't get any more wine,"" said Johnsy, keeping her eyes fixed out the window. ""There goes another. No, I don't want any broth. That leaves just four. I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I'll go, too.""  <br><br>  ""Johnsy, dear,"" said Sue, bending over her, ""will you promise me to keep your eyes closed, and not look out the window until I am done working? I must hand those drawings in by to-morrow. I need the light, or I would draw the shade down.""  <br><br>  ""Couldn't you draw in the other room?"" asked Johnsy, coldly.  <br><br>  ""I'd rather be here by you,"" said Sue. ""Beside, I don't want you to keep looking at those silly ivy leaves.""  <br><br>  ""Tell me as soon as you have finished,"" said Johnsy, closing her eyes, and lying white and still as fallen statue, ""because I want to see the last one fall. I'm tired of waiting. I'm tired of thinking. I want to turn loose my hold on everything, and go sailing down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.""  <br><br>  ""Try to sleep,"" said Sue. ""I must call Behrman up to be my model for the old hermit miner. I'll not be gone a minute. Don't try to move 'til I come back.""  <br><br>  Old Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor beneath them. He was past sixty and had a Michael Angelo's Moses beard curling down from the head of a satyr along with the body of an imp. Behrman was a failure in art. Forty years he had wielded the brush without getting near enough to touch the hem of his Mistress's robe. He had been always about to paint a masterpiece, but had never yet begun it. For several years he had painted nothing except now and then a daub in the line of commerce or advertising. He earned a little by serving as a model to those young artists in the colony who could not pay the price of a professional. He drank gin to excess, and still talked of his coming masterpiece. For the rest he was a fierce little old man, who scoffed terribly at softness in any one, and who regarded himself as especial mastiff-in-waiting to protect the two young artists in the studio above.  <br><br>  Sue found Behrman smelling strongly of juniper berries in his dimly lighted den below. In one corner was a blank canvas on an easel that had been waiting there for twenty-five years to receive the first line of the masterpiece. She told him of Johnsy's fancy, and how she feared she would, indeed, light and fragile as a leaf herself, float away, when her slight hold upon the world grew weaker.  <br><br>  Old Behrman, with his red eyes plainly streaming, shouted his contempt and derision for such idiotic imaginings.  <br><br>  ""Vass!"" he cried. ""Is dere people in de world mit der foolishness to die because leafs dey drop off from a confounded vine? I haf not heard of such a thing. No, I will not bose as a model for your fool hermit-dunderhead. Vy do you allow dot silly pusiness to come in der brain of her? Ach, dot poor leetle Miss Yohnsy.""  <br><br>  ""She is very ill and weak,"" said Sue, ""and the fever has left her mind morbid and full of strange fancies. Very well, Mr. Behrman, if you do not care to pose for me, you needn't. But I think you are a horrid old - old flibbertigibbet.""  <br><br>  ""You are just like a woman!"" yelled Behrman. ""Who said I will not bose? Go on. I come mit you. For half an hour I haf peen trying to say dot I am ready to bose. Gott! dis is not any blace in which one so goot as Miss Yohnsy shall lie sick. Some day I vill baint a masterpiece, and ve shall all go away. Gott! yes.""  <br><br>  Johnsy was sleeping when they went upstairs. Sue pulled the shade down to the window-sill, and motioned Behrman into the other room. In there they peered out the window fearfully at the ivy vine. Then they looked at each other for a moment without speaking. A persistent, cold rain was falling, mingled with snow. Behrman, in his old blue shirt, took his seat as the hermit miner on an upturned kettle for a rock.  <br><br>  When Sue awoke from an hour's sleep the next morning she found Johnsy with dull, wide-open eyes staring at the drawn green shade.  <br><br>  ""Pull it up; I want to see,"" she ordered, in a whisper.  <br><br>  Wearily Sue obeyed.  <br><br>  But, lo! after the beating rain and fierce gusts of wind that had endured through the livelong night, there yet stood out against the brick wall one ivy leaf. It was the last one on the vine. Still dark green near its stem, with its serrated edges tinted with the yellow of dissolution and decay, it hung bravely from the branch some twenty feet above the ground.  <br><br>  ""It is the last one,"" said Johnsy. ""I thought it would surely fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall to-day, and I shall die at the same time.""  <br><br>  ""Dear, dear!"" said Sue, leaning her worn face down to the pillow, ""think of me, if you won't think of yourself. What would I do?""  <br><br>  But Johnsy did not answer. The lonesomest thing in all the world is a soul when it is making ready to go on its mysterious, far journey. The fancy seemed to possess her more strongly as one by one the ties that bound her to friendship and to earth were loosed.  <br><br>  The day wore away, and even through the twilight they could see the lone ivy leaf clinging to its stem against the wall. And then, with the coming of the night the north wind was again loosed, while the rain still beat against the windows and pattered down from the low Dutch eaves.  <br><br>  When it was light enough Johnsy, the merciless, commanded that the shade be raised.  <br><br>  The ivy leaf was still there.  <br><br>  Johnsy lay for a long time looking at it. And then she called to Sue, who was stirring her chicken broth over the gas stove.  <br><br>  ""I've been a bad girl, Sudie,"" said Johnsy. ""Something has made that last leaf stay there to show me how wicked I was. It is a sin to want to die. You may bring a me a little broth now, and some milk with a little port in it, and - no; bring me a hand-mirror first, and then pack some pillows about me, and I will sit up and watch you cook.""  <br><br>  And hour later she said:  <br><br>  ""Sudie, some day I hope to paint the Bay of Naples.""  <br><br>  The doctor came in the afternoon, and Sue had an excuse to go into the hallway as he left.  <br><br>  ""Even chances,"" said the doctor, taking Sue's thin, shaking hand in his. ""With good nursing you'll win."" And now I must see another case I have downstairs. Behrman, his name is - some kind of an artist, I believe. Pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man, and the attack is acute. There is no hope for him; but he goes to the hospital to-day to be made more comfortable.""  <br><br>  The next day the doctor said to Sue: ""She's out of danger. You won. Nutrition and care now - that's all.""  <br><br>  And that afternoon Sue came to the bed where Johnsy lay, contentedly knitting a very blue and very useless woollen shoulder scarf, and put one arm around her, pillows and all.  <br><br>  ""I have something to tell you, white mouse,"" she said. ""Mr. Behrman died of pneumonia to-day in the hospital. He was ill only two days. The janitor found him the morning of the first day in his room downstairs helpless with pain. His shoes and clothing were wet through and icy cold. They couldn't imagine where he had been on such a dreadful night. And then they found a lantern, still lighted, and a ladder that had been dragged from its place, and some scattered brushes, and a palette with green and yellow colors mixed on it, and - look out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn't you wonder why it never fluttered or moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it's Behrman's masterpiece - he painted it there the night that the last leaf fell.""                             <br><br>"
93,The Pimienta Pancakes,"While we were rounding up a bunch of the Triangle-O cattle in the Frio bottoms a projecting branch of a dead mesquite caught my wooden stirrup and gave my ankle a wrench that laid me up in camp for a week.<br><br>    On the third day of my compulsory idleness I crawled out near the grub wagon, and reclined helpless under the conversational fire of Judson Odom, the camp cook. Jud was a monologist by nature, whom Destiny, with customary blundering, had set in a profession wherein he was bereaved, for the greater portion of his time, of an audience.<br><br>    Therefore, I was manna in the desert of Jud's obmutescence.<br><br>    Betimes I was stirred by invalid longings for something to eat that did not come under the caption of ""grub."" I had visions of the maternal pantry ""deep as first love, and wild with all regret,"" and then I asked:<br><br>    ""Jud, can you make pancakes?""<br><br>    Jud laid down his six-shooter, with which he was preparing to pound an antelope steak, and stood over me in what I felt to be a menacing attitude. He further endorsed my impression that his pose was resentful by fixing upon me with his light blue eyes a look of cold suspicion.<br><br>    ""Say, you,"" he said, with candid, though not excessive, choler, ""did you mean that straight, or was you trying to throw the gaff into me? Some of the boys been telling you about me and that pancake racket?""<br><br>    ""No, Jud,"" I said, sincerely, ""I meant it. It seems to me I'd swap my pony and saddle for a stack of buttered brown pancakes with some first crop, open kettle, New Orleans sweetening. Was there a story about pancakes?""<br><br>    Jud was mollified at once when he saw that I had not been dealing in allusions. He brought some mysterious bags and tin boxes from the grub wagon and set them in the shade of the hackberry where I lay reclined. I watched him as he began to arrange them leisurely and untie their many strings.<br><br>    ""No, not a story,"" said Jud, as he worked, ""but just the logical disclosures in the case of me and that pink-eyed snoozer from Mired Mule Canada and Miss Willella Learight. I don't mind telling you.<br><br>    ""I was punching then for old Bill Toomey, on the San Miguel. One day I gets all ensnared up in aspirations for to eat some canned grub that hasn't ever mooed or baaed or grunted or been in peck measures. So, I gets on my bronc and pushes the wind for Uncle Emsley Telfair's store at the Pimienta Crossing on the Nueces.<br><br>    ""About three in the afternoon I throwed my bridle rein over a mesquite limb and walked the last twenty yards into Uncle Emsley's store. I got up on the counter and told Uncle Emsley that the signs pointed to the devastation of the fruit crop of the world. In a minute I had a bag of crackers and a long-handled spoon, with an open can each of apricots and pineapples and cherries and greengages beside of me with Uncle Emsley busy chopping away with the hatchet at the yellow clings. I was feeling like Adam before the apple stampede, and was digging my spurs into the side of the counter and working with my twenty-four-inch spoon when I happened to look out of the window into the yard of Uncle Emsley's house, which was next to the store.<br><br>    ""There was a girl standing there--an imported girl with fixings on-- philandering with a croquet maul and amusing herself by watching my style of encouraging the fruit canning industry.<br><br>    ""I slid off the counter and delivered up my shovel to Uncle Emsley.<br><br>    ""'That's my niece,' says he; 'Miss Willella Learight, down from Palestine on a visit. Do you want that I should make you acquainted?'<br><br>    ""'The Holy Land,' I says to myself, my thoughts milling some as I tried to run 'em into the corral. 'Why not? There was sure angels in Pales--Why, yes, Uncle Emsley,' I says out loud, 'I'd be awful edified to meet Miss Learight.'<br><br>    ""So Uncle Emsley took me out in the yard and gave us each other's entitlements.<br><br>    ""I never was shy about women. I never could understand why some men who can break a mustang before breakfast and shave in the dark, get all left-handed and full of perspiration and excuses when they see a bold of calico draped around what belongs to it. Inside of eight minutes me and Miss Willella was aggravating the croquet balls around as amiable as second cousins. She gave me a dig about the quantity of canned fruit I had eaten, and I got back at her, flat-footed, about how a certain lady named Eve started the fruit trouble in the first free-grass pasture--'Over in Palestine, wasn't it?' says I, as easy and pat as roping a one-year-old.<br><br>    ""That was how I acquired cordiality for the proximities of Miss Willella Learight; and the disposition grew larger as time passed. She was stopping at Pimienta Crossing for her health, which was very good, and for the climate, which was forty per cent. hotter than Palestine. I rode over to see her once every week for a while; and then I figured it out that if I doubled the number of trips I would see her twice as often.<br><br>    ""One week I slipped in a third trip; and that's where the pancakes and the pink-eyed snoozer busted into the game.<br><br>    ""That evening, while I set on the counter with a peach and two damsons in my mouth, I asked Uncle Emsley how Miss Willella was.<br><br>    ""'Why,' says Uncle Emsley, 'she's gone riding with Jackson Bird, the sheep man from over at Mired Mule Canada.'<br><br>    ""I swallowed the peach seed and the two damson seeds. I guess somebody held the counter by the bridle while I got off; and then I walked out straight ahead till I butted against the mesquite where my roan was tied.<br><br>    ""'She's gone riding,' I whisper in my bronc's ear, 'with Birdstone Jack, the hired mule from Sheep Man's Canada. Did you get that, old Leather-and-Gallops?'<br><br>    ""That bronc of mine wept, in his way. He'd been raised a cow pony and he didn't care for snoozers.<br><br>    ""I went back and said to Uncle Emsley: 'Did you say a sheep man?'<br><br>    ""'I said a sheep man,' says Uncle Emsley again. 'You must have heard tell of Jackson Bird. He's got eight sections of grazing and four thousand head of the finest Merinos south of the Arctic Circle.'<br><br>    ""I went out and sat on the ground in the shade of the store and leaned against a prickly pear. I sifted sand into my boots with unthinking hands while I soliloquised a quantity about this bird with the Jackson plumage to his name.<br><br>    ""I never had believed in harming sheep men. I see one, one day, reading a Latin grammar on hossback, and I never touched him! They never irritated me like they do most cowmen. You wouldn't go to work now, and impair and disfigure snoozers, would you, that eat on tables and wear little shoes and speak to you on subjects? I had always let 'em pass, just as you would a jack-rabbit; with a polite word and a guess about the weather, but no stopping to swap canteens. I never thought it was worth while to be hostile with a snoozer. And because I'd been lenient, and let 'em live, here was one going around riding with Miss Willella Learight!<br><br>    ""An hour by sun they come loping back, and stopped at Uncle Emsley's gate. The sheep person helped her off; and they stood throwing each other sentences all sprightful and sagacious for a while. And then this feathered Jackson flies up in his saddle and raises his little stewpot of a hat, and trots off in the direction of his mutton ranch. By this time I had turned the sand out of my boots and unpinned myself from the prickly pear; and by the time he gets half a mile out of Pimienta, I singlefoots up beside him on my bronc.<br><br>    ""I said that snoozer was pink-eyed, but he wasn't. His seeing arrangement was grey enough, but his eye-lashes was pink and his hair was sandy, and that gave you the idea. Sheep man?--he wasn't more than a lamb man, anyhow--a little thing with his neck involved in a yellow silk handkerchief, and shoes tied up in bowknots.<br><br>    ""'Afternoon!' says I to him. 'You now ride with a equestrian who is commonly called Dead-Moral-Certainty Judson, on account of the way I shoot. When I want a stranger to know me I always introduce myself before the draw, for I never did like to shake hands with ghosts.'<br><br>    ""'Ah,' says he, just like that--'Ah, I'm glad to know you, Mr. Judson. I'm Jackson Bird, from over at Mired Mule Ranch.'<br><br>    ""Just then one of my eyes saw a roadrunner skipping down the hill with a young tarantula in his bill, and the other eye noticed a rabbit-hawk sitting on a dead limb in a water-elm. I popped over one after the other with my forty-five, just to show him. 'Two out of three,' says I. 'Birds just naturally seem to draw my fire wherever I go.'<br><br>    ""'Nice shooting,' says the sheep man, without a flutter. 'But don't you sometimes ever miss the third shot? Elegant fine rain that was last week for the young grass, Mr. Judson?' says he.<br><br>    ""'Willie,' says I, riding over close to his palfrey, 'your infatuated parents may have denounced you by the name of Jackson, but you sure moulted into a twittering Willie--let us slough off this here analysis of rain and the elements, and get down to talk that is outside the vocabulary of parrots. That is a bad habit you have got of riding with young ladies over at Pimienta. I've known birds,' says I, 'to be served on toast for less than that. Miss Willella,' says I, 'don't ever want any nest made out of sheep's wool by a tomtit of the Jacksonian branch of ornithology. Now, are you going to quit, or do you wish for to gallop up against this Dead-Moral-Certainty attachment to my name, which is good for two hyphens and at least one set of funeral obsequies?'<br><br>    ""Jackson Bird flushed up some, and then he laughed.<br><br>    ""'Why, Mr. Judson,' says he, 'you've got the wrong idea. I've called on Miss Learight a few times; but not for the purpose you imagine. My object is purely a gastronomical one.'<br><br>    ""I reached for my gun.<br><br>    ""'Any coyote,' says I, 'that would boast of dishonourable--'<br><br>    ""'Wait a minute,' says this Bird, 'till I explain. What would I do with a wife? If you ever saw that ranch of mine! I do my own cooking and mending. Eating--that's all the pleasure I get out of sheep raising. Mr. Judson, did you ever taste the pancakes that Miss Learight makes?'<br><br>    ""'Me? No,' I told him. 'I never was advised that she was up to any culinary manoeuvres.'<br><br>    ""'They're golden sunshine,' says he, 'honey-browned by the ambrosial fires of Epicurus. I'd give two years of my life to get the recipe for making them pancakes. That's what I went to see Miss Learight for,' says Jackson Bird, 'but I haven't been able to get it from her. It's an old recipe that's been in the family for seventy-five years. They hand it down from one generation to another, but they don't give it away to outsiders. If I could get that recipe, so I could make them pancakes for myself on my ranch, I'd be a happy man,' says Bird.<br><br>    ""'Are you sure,' I says to him, 'that it ain't the hand that mixes the pancakes that you're after?'<br><br>    ""'Sure,' says Jackson. 'Miss Learight is a mighty nice girl, but I can assure you my intentions go no further than the gastro--' but he seen my hand going down to my holster and he changed his similitude--'than the desire to procure a copy of the pancake recipe,' he finishes.<br><br>    ""'You ain't such a bad little man,' says I, trying to be fair. 'I was thinking some of making orphans of your sheep, but I'll let you fly away this time. But you stick to pancakes,' says I, 'as close as the middle one of a stack; and don't go and mistake sentiments for syrup, or there'll be singing at your ranch, and you won't hear it.'<br><br>    ""'To convince you that I am sincere,' says the sheep man, 'I'll ask you to help me. Miss Learight and you being closer friends, maybe she would do for you what she wouldn't for me. If you will get me a copy of that pancake recipe, I give you my word that I'll never call upon her again.'<br><br>    ""'That's fair,' I says, and I shook hands with Jackson Bird. 'I'll get it for you if I can, and glad to oblige.' And he turned off down the big pear flat on the Piedra, in the direction of Mired Mule; and I steered northwest for old Bill Toomey's ranch.<br><br>    ""It was five days afterward when I got another chance to ride over to Pimienta. Miss Willella and me passed a gratifying evening at Uncle Emsley's. She sang some, and exasperated the piano quite a lot with quotations from the operas. I gave imitations of a rattlesnake, and told her about Snaky McFee's new way of skinning cows, and described the trip I made to Saint Louis once. We was getting along in one another's estimations fine. Thinks I, if Jackson Bird can now be persuaded to migrate, I win. I recollect his promise about the pancake receipt, and I thinks I will persuade it from Miss Willella and give it to him; and then if I catches Birdie off of Mired Mule again, I'll make him hop the twig.<br><br>    ""So, along about ten o'clock, I put on a wheedling smile and says to Miss Willella: 'Now, if there's anything I do like better than the sight of a red steer on green grass it's the taste of a nice hot pancake smothered in sugar-house molasses.'<br><br>    ""Miss Willella gives a little jump on the piano stool, and looked at me curious.<br><br>    ""'Yes,' says she, 'they're real nice. What did you say was the name of that street in Saint Louis, Mr. Odom, where you lost your hat?'<br><br>    ""'Pancake Avenue,' says I, with a wink, to show her that I was on about the family receipt, and couldn't be side-corralled off of the subject. 'Come, now, Miss Willella,' I says; 'let's hear how you make 'em. Pancakes is just whirling in my head like wagon wheels. Start her off, now--pound of flour, eight dozen eggs, and so on. How does the catalogue of constituents run?'<br><br>    ""'Excuse me for a moment, please,' says Miss Willella, and she gives me a quick kind of sideways look, and slides off the stool. She ambled out into the other room, and directly Uncle Emsley comes in in his shirt sleeves, with a pitcher of water. He turns around to get a glass on the table, and I see a forty-five in his hip pocket. 'Great post- holes!' thinks I, 'but here's a family thinks a heap of cooking receipts, protecting it with firearms. I've known outfits that wouldn't do that much by a family feud.'<br><br>    ""'Drink this here down,' says Uncle Emsley, handing me the glass of water. 'You've rid too far to-day, Jud, and got yourself over-excited. Try to think about something else now.'<br><br>    ""'Do you know how to make them pancakes, Uncle Emsley?' I asked.<br><br>    ""'Well, I'm not as apprised in the anatomy of them as some,' says Uncle Emsley, 'but I reckon you take a sifter of plaster of Paris and a little dough and saleratus and corn meal, and mix 'em with eggs and buttermilk as usual. Is old Bill going to ship beeves to Kansas City again this spring, Jud?'<br><br>    ""That was all the pancake specifications I could get that night. I didn't wonder that Jackson Bird found it uphill work. So I dropped the subject and talked with Uncle Emsley for a while about hollow-horn and cyclones. And then Miss Willella came and said 'Good-night,' and I hit the breeze for the ranch.<br><br>    ""About a week afterward I met Jackson Bird riding out of Pimienta as I rode in, and we stopped on the road for a few frivolous remarks.<br><br>    ""'Got the bill of particulars for them flapjacks yet?' I asked him.<br><br>    ""'Well, no,' says Jackson. 'I don't seem to have any success in getting hold of it. Did you try?'<br><br>    ""'I did,' says I, 'and 'twas like trying to dig a prairie dog out of his hole with a peanut hull. That pancake receipt must be a jookalorum, the way they hold on to it.'<br><br>    ""'I'm most ready to give it up,' says Jackson, so discouraged in his pronunciations that I felt sorry for him; 'but I did want to know how to make them pancakes to eat on my lonely ranch,' says he. 'I lie awake at nights thinking how good they are.'<br><br>    ""'You keep on trying for it,' I tells him, 'and I'll do the same. One of us is bound to get a rope over its horns before long. Well, so- long, Jacksy.'<br><br>    ""You see, by this time we were on the peacefullest of terms. When I saw that he wasn't after Miss Willella, I had more endurable contemplations of that sandy-haired snoozer. In order to help out the ambitions of his appetite I kept on trying to get that receipt from Miss Willella. But every time I would say 'pancakes' she would get sort of remote and fidgety about the eye, and try to change the subject. If I held her to it she would slide out and round up Uncle Emsley with his pitcher of water and hip-pocket howitzer.<br><br>    ""One day I galloped over to the store with a fine bunch of blue verbenas that I cut out of a herd of wild flowers over on Poisoned Dog Prairie. Uncle Emsley looked at 'em with one eye shut and says:<br><br>    ""'Haven't ye heard the news?'<br><br>    ""'Cattle up?' I asks.<br><br>    ""'Willella and Jackson Bird was married in Palestine yesterday,' says he. 'Just got a letter this morning.'<br><br>    ""I dropped them flowers in a cracker-barrel, and let the news trickle in my ears and down toward my upper left-hand shirt pocket until it got to my feet.<br><br>    ""'Would you mind saying that over again once more, Uncle Emsley?' says I. 'Maybe my hearing has got wrong, and you only said that prime heifers was 4.80 on the hoof, or something like that.'<br><br>    ""'Married yesterday,' says Uncle Emsley, 'and gone to Waco and Niagara Falls on a wedding tour. Why, didn't you see none of the signs all along? Jackson Bird has been courting Willella ever since that day he took her out riding.'<br><br>    ""'Then,' says I, in a kind of yell, 'what was all this zizzaparoola he gives me about pancakes? Tell me that.'<br><br>    ""When I said 'pancakes' Uncle Emsley sort of dodged and stepped back.<br><br>    ""'Somebody's been dealing me pancakes from the bottom of the deck,' I says, 'and I'll find out. I believe you know. Talk up,' says I, 'or we'll mix a panful of batter right here.'<br><br>    ""I slid over the counter after Uncle Emsley. He grabbed at his gun, but it was in a drawer, and he missed it two inches. I got him by the front of his shirt and shoved him in a corner.<br><br>    ""'Talk pancakes,' says I, 'or be made into one. Does Miss Willella make 'em?'<br><br>    ""'She never made one in her life and I never saw one,' says Uncle Emsley, soothing. 'Calm down now, Jud--calm down. You've got excited, and that wound in your head is contaminating your sense of intelligence. Try not to think about pancakes.'<br><br>    ""'Uncle Emsley,' says I, 'I'm not wounded in the head except so far as my natural cognitive instincts run to runts. Jackson Bird told me he was calling on Miss Willella for the purpose of finding out her system of producing pancakes, and he asked me to help him get the bill of lading of the ingredients. I done so, with the results as you see. Have I been sodded down with Johnson grass by a pink-eyed snoozer, or what?'<br><br>    ""'Slack up your grip in my dress shirt,' says Uncle Emsley, 'and I'll tell you. Yes, it looks like Jackson Bird has gone and humbugged you some. The day after he went riding with Willella he came back and told me and her to watch out for you whenever you got to talking about pancakes. He said you was in camp once where they was cooking flapjacks, and one of the fellows cut you over the head with a frying pan. Jackson said that whenever you got overhot or excited that wound hurt you and made you kind of crazy, and you went raving about pancakes. He told us to just get you worked off of the subject and soothed down, and you wouldn't be dangerous. So, me and Willella done the best by you we knew how. Well, well,' says Uncle Emsley, 'that Jackson Bird is sure a seldom kind of a snoozer.'""<br><br>    During the progress of Jud's story he had been slowly but deftly combining certain portions of the contents of his sacks and cans. Toward the close of it he set before me the finished product--a pair of red-hot, rich-hued pancakes on a tin plate. From some secret hoarding he also brought a lump of excellent butter and a bottle of golden syrup.<br><br>    ""How long ago did these things happen?"" I asked him.<br><br>    ""Three years,"" said Jud. ""They're living on the Mired Mule Ranch now. But I haven't seen either of 'em since. They say Jackson Bird was fixing his ranch up fine with rocking chairs and window curtains all the time he was putting me up the pancake tree. Oh, I got over it after a while. But the boys kept the racket up.""<br><br>    ""Did you make these cakes by the famous recipe?"" I asked.<br><br>    ""Didn't I tell you there wasn't no receipt?"" said Jud. ""The boys hollered pancakes till they got pancake hungry, and I cut this recipe out of a newspaper. How does the truck taste?""<br><br>    ""They're delicious,"" I answered. ""Why don't you have some, too, Jud?""<br><br>    I was sure I heard a sigh.<br><br>    ""Me?"" said Jud. ""I don't ever eat 'em.""                             <br><br>"
94,The Princess And The Puma,"There had to be a king and queen, of course. The king was a terrible old man who wore six-shooters and spurs, and shouted in such a tremendous voice that the rattlers on the prairie would run into their holes under the prickly pear. Before there was a royal family they called the man ""Whispering Ben."" When he came to own 50,000 acres of land and more cattle than he could count, they called him O'Donnell ""the Cattle King.""<br><br>    The queen had been a Mexican girl from Laredo. She made a good, mild, Colorado-claro wife, and even succeeded in teaching Ben to modify his voice sufficiently while in the house to keep the dishes from being broken. When Ben got to be king she would sit on the gallery of Espinosa Ranch and weave rush mats. When wealth became so irresistible and oppressive that upholstered chairs and a centre table were brought down from San Antone in the wagons, she bowed her smooth, dark head, and shared the fate of the Danae.<br><br>    To avoid lese-majeste you have been presented first to the king and queen. They do not enter the story, which might be called ""The Chronicle of the Princess, the Happy Thought, and the Lion that Bungled his Job.""<br><br>    Josefa O'Donnell was the surviving daughter, the princess. From her mother she inherited warmth of nature and a dusky, semi-tropic beauty. From Ben O'Donnell the royal she acquired a store of intrepidity, common sense, and the faculty of ruling. The combination was one worth going miles to see. Josefa while riding her pony at a gallop could put five out of six bullets through a tomato-can swinging at the end of a string. She could play for hours with a white kitten she owned, dressing it in all manner of absurd clothes. Scorning a pencil, she could tell you out of her head what 1545 two-year-olds would bring on the hoof, at $8.50 per head. Roughly speaking, the Espinosa Ranch is forty miles long and thirty broad--but mostly leased land. Josefa, on her pony, had prospected over every mile of it. Every cow-puncher on the range knew her by sight and was a loyal vassal. Ripley Givens, foreman of one of the Espinosa outfits, saw her one day, and made up his mind to form a royal matrimonial alliance. Presumptuous? No. In those days in the Nueces country a man was a man. And, after all, the title of cattle king does not presuppose blood royalty. Often it only signifies that its owner wears the crown in token of his magnificent qualities in the art of cattle stealing.<br><br>    One day Ripley Givens rode over to the Double Elm Ranch to inquire about a bunch of strayed yearlings. He was late in setting out on his return trip, and it was sundown when he struck the White Horse Crossing of the Nueces. From there to his own camp it was sixteen miles. To the Espinosa ranch it was twelve. Givens was tired. He decided to pass the night at the Crossing.<br><br>    There was a fine water hole in the river-bed. The banks were thickly covered with great trees, undergrown with brush. Back from the water hole fifty yards was a stretch of curly mesquite grass--supper for his horse and bed for himself. Givens staked his horse, and spread out his saddle blankets to dry. He sat down with his back against a tree and rolled a cigarette. From somewhere in the dense timber along the river came a sudden, rageful, shivering wail. The pony danced at the end of his rope and blew a whistling snort of comprehending fear. Givens puffed at his cigarette, but he reached leisurely for his pistol-belt, which lay on the grass, and twirled the cylinder of his weapon tentatively. A great gar plunged with a loud splash into the water hole. A little brown rabbit skipped around a bunch of catclaw and sat twitching his whiskers and looking humorously at Givens. The pony went on eating grass.<br><br>    It is well to be reasonably watchful when a Mexican lion sings soprano along the arroyos at sundown. The burden of his song may be that young calves and fat lambs are scarce, and that he has a carnivorous desire for your acquaintance.<br><br>    In the grass lay an empty fruit can, cast there by some former sojourner. Givens caught sight of it with a grunt of satisfaction. In his coat pocket tied behind his saddle was a handful or two of ground coffee. Black coffee and cigarettes! What ranchero could desire more?<br><br>    In two minutes he had a little fire going clearly. He started, with his can, for the water hole. When within fifteen yards of its edge he saw, between the bushes, a side-saddled pony with down-dropped reins cropping grass a little distance to his left. Just rising from her hands and knees on the brink of the water hole was Josefa O'Donnell. She had been drinking water, and she brushed the sand from the palms of her hands. Ten yards away, to her right, half concealed by a clump of sacuista, Givens saw the crouching form of the Mexican lion. His amber eyeballs glared hungrily; six feet from them was the tip of the tail stretched straight, like a pointer's. His hind-quarters rocked with the motion of the cat tribe preliminary to leaping.<br><br>    Givens did what he could. His six-shooter was thirty-five yards away lying on the grass. He gave a loud yell, and dashed between the lion and the princess.<br><br>    The ""rucus,"" as Givens called it afterward, was brief and somewhat confused. When he arrived on the line of attack he saw a dim streak in the air, and heard a couple of faint cracks. Then a hundred pounds of Mexican lion plumped down upon his head and flattened him, with a heavy jar, to the ground. He remembered calling out: ""Let up, now--no fair gouging!"" and then he crawled from under the lion like a worm, with his mouth full of grass and dirt, and a big lump on the back of his head where it had struck the root of a water-elm. The lion lay motionless. Givens, feeling aggrieved, and suspicious of fouls, shook his fist at the lion, and shouted: ""I'll rastle you again for twenty--"" and then he got back to himself.<br><br>    Josefa was standing in her tracks, quietly reloading her silver- mounted .38. It had not been a difficult shot. The lion's head made an easier mark than a tomato-can swinging at the end of a string. There was a provoking, teasing, maddening smile upon her mouth and in her dark eyes. The would-be-rescuing knight felt the fire of his fiasco burn down to his soul. Here had been his chance, the chance that he had dreamed of; and Momus, and not Cupid, had presided over it. The satyrs in the wood were, no doubt, holding their sides in hilarious, silent laughter. There had been something like vaudeville--say Signor Givens and his funny knockabout act with the stuffed lion.<br><br>    ""Is that you, Mr. Givens?"" said Josefa, in her deliberate, saccharine contralto. ""You nearly spoilt my shot when you yelled. Did you hurt your head when you fell?""<br><br>    ""Oh, no,"" said Givens, quietly; ""that didn't hurt."" He stooped ignominiously and dragged his best Stetson hat from under the beast. It was crushed and wrinkled to a fine comedy effect. Then he knelt down and softly stroked the fierce, open-jawed head of the dead lion.<br><br>    ""Poor old Bill!"" he exclaimed mournfully.<br><br>    ""What's that?"" asked Josefa, sharply.<br><br>    ""Of course you didn't know, Miss Josefa,"" said Givens, with an air of one allowing magnanimity to triumph over grief. ""Nobody can blame you. I tried to save him, but I couldn't let you know in time.""<br><br>    ""Save who?""<br><br>    ""Why, Bill. I've been looking for him all day. You see, he's been our camp pet for two years. Poor old fellow, he wouldn't have hurt a cottontail rabbit. It'll break the boys all up when they hear about it. But you couldn't tell, of course, that Bill was just trying to play with you.""<br><br>    Josefa's black eyes burned steadily upon him. Ripley Givens met the test successfully. He stood rumpling the yellow-brown curls on his head pensively. In his eye was regret, not unmingled with a gentle reproach. His smooth features were set to a pattern of indisputable sorrow. Josefa wavered.<br><br>    ""What was your pet doing here?"" she asked, making a last stand. ""There's no camp near the White Horse Crossing.""<br><br>    ""The old rascal ran away from camp yesterday,"" answered Givens readily. ""It's a wonder the coyotes didn't scare him to death. You see, Jim Webster, our horse wrangler, brought a little terrier pup into camp last week. The pup made life miserable for Bill--he used to chase him around and chew his hind legs for hours at a time. Every night when bedtime came Bill would sneak under one of the boy's blankets and sleep to keep the pup from finding him. I reckon he must have been worried pretty desperate or he wouldn't have run away. He was always afraid to get out of sight of camp.""<br><br>    Josefa looked at the body of the fierce animal. Givens gently patted one of the formidable paws that could have killed a yearling calf with one blow. Slowly a red flush widened upon the dark olive face of the girl. Was it the signal of shame of the true sportsman who has brought down ignoble quarry? Her eyes grew softer, and the lowered lids drove away all their bright mockery.<br><br>    ""I'm very sorry,"" she said humbly; ""but he looked so big, and jumped so high that--""<br><br>    ""Poor old Bill was hungry,"" interrupted Givens, in quick defence of the deceased. ""We always made him jump for his supper in camp. He would lie down and roll over for a piece of meat. When he saw you he thought he was going to get something to eat from you.""<br><br>    Suddenly Josefa's eyes opened wide.<br><br>    ""I might have shot you!"" she exclaimed. ""You ran right in between. You risked your life to save your pet! That was fine, Mr. Givens. I like a man who is kind to animals.""<br><br>    Yes; there was even admiration in her gaze now. After all, there was a hero rising out of the ruins of the anti-climax. The look on Givens's face would have secured him a high position in the S.P.C.A.<br><br>    ""I always loved 'em,"" said he; ""horses, dogs, Mexican lions, cows, alligators--""<br><br>    ""I hate alligators,"" instantly demurred Josefa; ""crawly, muddy things!""<br><br>    ""Did I say alligators?"" said Givens. ""I meant antelopes, of course.""<br><br>    Josefa's conscience drove her to make further amends. She held out her hand penitently. There was a bright, unshed drop in each of her eyes.<br><br>    ""Please forgive me, Mr. Givens, won't you? I'm only a girl, you know, and I was frightened at first. I'm very, very sorry I shot Bill. You don't know how ashamed I feel. I wouldn't have done it for anything.""<br><br>    Givens took the proffered hand. He held it for a time while he allowed the generosity of his nature to overcome his grief at the loss of Bill. At last it was clear that he had forgiven her.<br><br>    ""Please don't speak of it any more, Miss Josefa. 'Twas enough to frighten any young lady the way Bill looked. I'll explain it all right to the boys.""<br><br>    ""Are you really sure you don't hate me?"" Josefa came closer to him impulsively. Her eyes were sweet--oh, sweet and pleading with gracious penitence. ""I would hate anyone who would kill my kitten. And how daring and kind of you to risk being shot when you tried to save him! How very few men would have done that!"" Victory wrested from defeat! Vaudeville turned into drama! Bravo, Ripley Givens!<br><br>    It was now twilight. Of course Miss Josefa could not be allowed to ride on to the ranch-house alone. Givens resaddled his pony in spite of that animal's reproachful glances, and rode with her. Side by side they galloped across the smooth grass, the princess and the man who was kind to animals. The prairie odours of fruitful earth and delicate bloom were thick and sweet around them. Coyotes yelping over there on the hill! No fear. And yet--<br><br>    Josefa rode closer. A little hand seemed to grope. Givens found it with his own. The ponies kept an even gait. The hands lingered together, and the owner of one explained:<br><br>    ""I never was frightened before, but just think! How terrible it would be to meet a really wild lion! Poor Bill! I'm so glad you came with me!""<br><br>    O'Donnell was sitting on the ranch gallery.<br><br>    ""Hello, Rip!"" he shouted--""that you?""<br><br>    ""He rode in with me,"" said Josefa. ""I lost my way and was late.""<br><br>    ""Much obliged,"" called the cattle king. ""Stop over, Rip, and ride to camp in the morning.""<br><br>    But Givens would not. He would push on to camp. There was a bunch of steers to start off on the trail at daybreak. He said good-night, and trotted away.<br><br>    An hour later, when the lights were out, Josefa, in her night-robe, came to her door and called to the king in his own room across the brick-paved hallway:<br><br>    ""Say, pop, you know that old Mexican lion they call the 'Gotch-eared Devil'--the one that killed Gonzales, Mr. Martin's sheep herder, and about fifty calves on the Salado range? Well, I settled his hash this afternoon over at the White Horse Crossing. Put two balls in his head with my .38 while he was on the jump. I knew him by the slice gone from his left ear that old Gonzales cut off with his machete. You couldn't have made a better shot yourself, daddy.""<br><br>    ""Bully for you!"" thundered Whispering Ben from the darkness of the royal chamber.                             <br><br>"
95,The Ransom Of Red Chief,"It looked like a good thing: but wait till I tell you. We were down South, in Alabama--Bill Driscoll and myself-when this kidnapping idea struck us. It was, as Bill afterward expressed it, ""during a moment of temporary mental apparition""; but we didn't find that out till later.  <br><br>  There was a town down there, as flat as a flannel-cake, and called Summit, of course. It contained inhabitants of as undeleterious and self-satisfied a class of peasantry as ever clustered around a Maypole.  <br><br>  Bill and me had a joint capital of about six hundred dollars, and we needed just two thousand dollars more to pull off a fraudulent town-lot scheme in Western Illinois with. We talked it over on the front steps of the hotel. Philoprogenitiveness, says we, is strong in semi-rural communities therefore, and for other reasons, a kidnapping project ought to do better there than in the radius of newspapers that send reporters out in plain clothes to stir up talk about such things. We knew that Summit couldn't get after us with anything stronger than constables and, maybe, some lackadaisical bloodhounds and a diatribe or two in the Weekly Farmers' Budget. So, it looked good.  <br><br>  We selected for our victim the only child of a prominent citizen named Ebenezer Dorset. The father was respectable and tight, a mortgage fancier and a stern, upright collection-plate passer and forecloser. The kid was a boy of ten, with bas-relief freckles, and hair the colour of the cover of the magazine you buy at the news-stand when you want to catch a train. Bill and me figured that Ebenezer would melt down for a ransom of two thousand dollars to a cent. But wait till I tell you.  <br><br>  About two miles from Summit was a little mountain, covered with a dense cedar brake. On the rear elevation of this mountain was a cave. There we stored provisions.  <br><br>  One evening after sundown, we drove in a buggy past old Dorset's house. The kid was in the street, throwing rocks at a kitten on the opposite fence.  <br><br>  ""Hey, little boy!"" says Bill, ""would you like to have a bag of candy and a nice ride?""  <br><br>  The boy catches Bill neatly in the eye with a piece of brick.  <br><br>  ""That will cost the old man an extra five hundred dollars,"" says Bill, climbing over the wheel.  <br><br>  That boy put up a fight like a welter-weight cinnamon bear; but, at last, we got him down in the bottom of the buggy and drove away. We took him up to the cave, and I hitched the horse in the cedar brake. After dark I drove the buggy to the little village, three miles away, where we had hired it, and walked back to the mountain.  <br><br>  Bill was pasting court-plaster over the scratches and bruises on his features. There was a fire burning behind the big rock at the entrance of the cave, and the boy was watching a pot of boiling coffee, with two buzzard tailfeathers stuck in his red hair. He points a stick at me when I come up, and says:  <br><br>  ""Ha! cursed paleface, do you dare to enter the camp of Red Chief, the terror of the plains?""  <br><br>  ""He's all right now,"" says Bill, rolling up his trousers and examining some bruises on his shins. ""We're playing Indian. We're making Buffalo Bill's show look like magic-lantern views of Palestine in the town hall. I'm Old Hank, the Trapper, Red Chief's captive, and I'm to be scalped at daybreak. By Geronimo! that kid can kick hard.""  <br><br>  Yes, sir, that boy seemed to be having the time of his life. The fun of camping out in a cave had made him forget that he was a captive himself. He immediately christened me Snake-eye, the Spy, and announced that, when his braves returned from the warpath, I was to be broiled at the stake at the rising of the sun.  <br><br>  Then we had supper; and he filled his mouth full of bacon and bread and gravy, and began to talk. He made a during-dinner speech something like this:  <br><br>  ""I like this fine. I never camped out before; but I had a pet 'possum once, and I was nine last birthday. I hate to go to school. Rats ate up sixteen of Jimmy Talbot's aunt's speckled hen's eggs. Are there any real Indians in these woods? I want some more gravy. Does the trees moving make the wind blow? We had five puppies. What makes your nose so red, Hank? My father has lots of money. Are the stars hot? I whipped Ed Walker twice, Saturday. I don't like girls. You dassent catch toads unless with a string. Do oxen make any noise? Why are oranges round? Have you got beds to sleep on in this cave? Amos Murray has got six toes. A parrot can talk, but a monkey or a fish can't. How many does it take to make twelve?""  <br><br>  Every few minutes he would remember that he was a pesky redskin, and pick up his stick rifle and tiptoe to the mouth of the cave to rubber for the scouts of the hated paleface. Now and then he would let out a warwhoop that made Old Hank the Trapper, shiver. That boy had Bill terrorized from the start.  <br><br>  ""Red Chief,"" says I to the kid, ""would you like to go home?""  <br><br>  ""Aw, what for?"" says he. ""I don't have any fun at home. I hate to go to school. I like to camp out. You won't take me back home again, Snake-eye, will you?""  <br><br>  ""Not right away,"" says I. ""We'll stay here in the cave a while.""  <br><br>  ""All right!"" says he. ""That'll be fine. I never had such fun in all my life.""  <br><br>  We went to bed about eleven o'clock. We spread down some wide blankets and quilts and put Red Chief between us. We weren't afraid he'd run away. He kept us awake for three hours, jumping up and reaching for his rifle and screeching: ""Hist! pard,"" in mine and Bill's ears, as the fancied crackle of a twig or the rustle of a leaf revealed to his young imagination the stealthy approach of the outlaw band. At last, I fell into a troubled sleep, and dreamed that I had been kidnapped and chained to a tree by a ferocious pirate with red hair.  <br><br>  Just at daybreak, I was awakened by a series of awful screams from Bill. They weren't yells, or howls, or shouts, or whoops, or yawps, such as you'd expect from a manly set of vocal organs--they were simply indecent, terrifying, humiliating screams, such as women emit when they see ghosts or caterpillars. It's an awful thing to hear a strong, desperate, fat man scream incontinently in a cave at daybreak.  <br><br>  I jumped up to see what the matter was. Red Chief was sitting on Bill's chest, with one hand twined in Bill's hair. In the other he had the sharp case-knife we used for slicing bacon; and he was industriously and realistically trying to take Bill's scalp, according to the sentence that had been pronounced upon him the evening before.  <br><br>  I got the knife away from the kid and made him lie down again. But, from that moment, Bill's spirit was broken. He laid down on his side of the bed, but he never closed an eye again in sleep as long as that boy was with us. I dozed off for a while, but along toward sun-up I remembered that Red Chief had said I was to be burned at the stake at the rising of the sun. I wasn't nervous or afraid; but I sat up and lit my pipe and leaned against a rock.  <br><br>  ""What you getting up so soon for, Sam?"" asked Bill.  <br><br>  ""Me?"" says I. ""Oh, I got a kind of a pain in my shoulder. I thought sitting up would rest it.""  <br><br>  ""You're a liar!"" says Bill. ""You're afraid. You was to be burned at sunrise, and you was afraid he'd do it. And he would, too, if he could find a match. Ain't it awful, Sam? Do you think anybody will pay out money to get a little imp like that back home?""  <br><br>  ""Sure,"" said I. ""A rowdy kid like that is just the kind that parents dote on. Now, you and the Chief get up and cook breakfast, while I go up on the top of this mountain and reconnoitre.""  <br><br>  I went up on the peak of the little mountain and ran my eye over the contiguous vicinity. Over toward Summit I expected to see the sturdy yeomanry of the village armed with scythes and pitchforks beating the countryside for the dastardly kidnappers. But what I saw was a peaceful landscape dotted with one man ploughing with a dun mule. Nobody was dragging the creek; no couriers dashed hither and yon, bringing tidings of no news to the distracted parents. There was a sylvan attitude of somnolent sleepiness pervading that section of the external outward surface of Alabama that lay exposed to my view. ""Perhaps,"" says I to myself, ""it has not yet been discovered that the wolves have borne away the tender lambkin from the fold. Heaven help the wolves!"" says I, and I went down the mountain to breakfast.  <br><br>  When I got to the cave I found Bill backed up against the side of it, breathing hard, and the boy threatening to smash him with a rock half as big as a cocoanut.  <br><br>  ""He put a red-hot boiled potato down my back,"" explained Bill, ""and then mashed it with his foot; and I boxed his ears. Have you got a gun about you, Sam?""  <br><br>  I took the rock away from the boy and kind of patched up the argument. ""I'll fix you,"" says the kid to Bill. ""No man ever yet struck the Red Chief but what he got paid for it. You better beware!""  <br><br>  After breakfast the kid takes a piece of leather with strings wrapped around it out of his pocket and goes outside the cave unwinding it.  <br><br>  ""What's he up to now?"" says Bill, anxiously. ""You don't think he'll run away, do you, Sam?""  <br><br>  ""No fear of it,"" says I. ""He don't seem to be much of a home body. But we've got to fix up some plan about the ransom. There don't seem to be much excitement around Summit on account of his disappearance; but maybe they haven't realized yet that he's gone. His folks may think he's spending the night with Aunt Jane or one of the neighbours. Anyhow, he'll be missed to-day. To-night we must get a message to his father demanding the two thousand dollars for his return.""  <br><br>  Just then we heard a kind of war-whoop, such as David might have emitted when he knocked out the champion Goliath. It was a sling that Red Chief had pulled out of his pocket, and he was whirling it around his head.  <br><br>  I dodged, and heard a heavy thud and a kind of a sigh from Bill, like a horse gives out when you take his saddle off. A niggerhead rock the size of an egg had caught Bill just behind his left ear. He loosened himself all over and fell in the fire across the frying pan of hot water for washing the dishes. I dragged him out and poured cold water on his head for half an hour.  <br><br>  By and by, Bill sits up and feels behind his ear and says: ""Sam, do you know who my favourite Biblical character is?""  <br><br>  ""Take it easy,"" says I. ""You'll come to your senses presently.""  <br><br>  ""King Herod,"" says he. ""You won't go away and leave me here alone, will you, Sam?""  <br><br>  I went out and caught that boy and shook him until his freckles rattled.  <br><br>  ""If you don't behave,"" says I, ""I'll take you straight home. Now, are you going to be good, or not?""  <br><br>  ""I was only funning,"" says he sullenly. ""I didn't mean to hurt Old Hank. But what did he hit me for? I'll behave, Snake-eye, if you won't send me home, and if you'll let me play the Black Scout to-day.""  <br><br>  ""I don't know the game,"" says I. ""That's for you and Mr. Bill to decide. He's your playmate for the day. I'm going away for a while, on business. Now, you come in and make friends with him and say you are sorry for hurting him, or home you go, at once.""  <br><br>  I made him and Bill shake hands, and then I took Bill aside and told him I was going to Poplar Cove, a little village three miles from the cave, and find out what I could about how the kidnapping had been regarded in Summit. Also, I thought it best to send a peremptory letter to old man Dorset that day, demanding the ransom and dictating how it should be paid.  <br><br>  ""You know, Sam,"" says Bill, ""I've stood by you without batting an eye in earthquakes, fire and flood--in poker games, dynamite outrages, police raids, train robberies and cyclones. I never lost my nerve yet till we kidnapped that two-legged skyrocket of a kid. He's got me going. You won't leave me long with him, will you, Sam?""  <br><br>  ""I'll be back some time this afternoon,"" says I. ""You must keep the boy amused and quiet till I return. And now we'll write the letter to old Dorset.""  <br><br>  Bill and I got paper and pencil and worked on the letter while Red Chief, with a blanket wrapped around him, strutted up and down, guarding the mouth of the cave. Bill begged me tearfully to make the ransom fifteen hundred dollars instead of two thousand. ""I ain't attempting,"" says he, ""to decry the celebrated moral aspect of parental affection, but we're dealing with humans, and it ain't human for anybody to give up two thousand dollars for that forty-pound chunk of freckled wildcat. I'm willing to take a chance at fifteen hundred dollars. You can charge the difference up to me.""  <br><br>  So, to relieve Bill, I acceded, and we collaborated a letter that ran this way:  <br><br>  <i>Ebenezer Dorset, Esq.:</i>  <br><br>  We have your boy concealed in a place far from Summit. It is useless for you or the most skilful detectives to attempt to find him. Absolutely, the only terms on which you can have him restored to you are these: We demand fifteen hundred dollars in large bills for his return; the money to be left at midnight to-night at the same spot and in the same box as your reply--as hereinafter described. If you agree to these terms, send your answer in writing by a solitary messenger to-night at half-past eight o'clock. After crossing Owl Creek, on the road to Poplar Cove, there are three large trees about a hundred yards apart, close to the fence of the wheat field on the right-hand side. At the bottom of the fence-post, opposite the third tree, will be found a small pasteboard box.  <br><br>  The messenger will place the answer in this box and return immediately to Summit.  <br><br>  If you attempt any treachery or fail to comply with our demand as stated, you will never see your boy again.  <br><br>  If you pay the money as demanded, he will be returned to you safe and well within three hours. These terms are final, and if you do not accede to them no further communication will be attempted.  <br><br>  TWO DESPERATE MEN.  <br><br>  I addressed this letter to Dorset, and put it in my pocket. As I was about to start, the kid comes up to me and says:  <br><br>  ""Aw, Snake-eye, you said I could play the Black Scout while you was gone.""  <br><br>  ""Play it, of course,"" says I. ""Mr. Bill will play with you. What kind of a game is it?""  <br><br>  ""I'm the Black Scout,"" says Red Chief, ""and I have to ride to the stockade to warn the settlers that the Indians are coming. I 'm tired of playing Indian myself. I want to be the Black Scout.""  <br><br>  ""All right,"" says I. ""It sounds harmless to me. I guess Mr. Bill will help you foil the pesky savages.""  <br><br>  ""What am I to do?"" asks Bill, looking at the kid suspiciously.  <br><br>  ""You are the hoss,"" says Black Scout. ""Get down on your hands and knees. How can I ride to the stockade without a hoss?""  <br><br>  ""You'd better keep him interested,"" said I, ""till we get the scheme going. Loosen up.""  <br><br>  Bill gets down on his all fours, and a look comes in his eye like a rabbit's when you catch it in a trap.  <br><br>  "" How far is it to the stockade, kid? "" he asks, in a husky manner of voice.  <br><br>  ""Ninety miles,"" says the Black Scout. ""And you have to hump yourself to get there on time. Whoa, now!""  <br><br>  The Black Scout jumps on Bill's back and digs his heels in his side.  <br><br>  ""For Heaven's sake,"" says Bill, ""hurry back, Sam, as soon as you can. I wish we hadn't made the ransom more than a thousand. Say, you quit kicking me or I '11 get up and warm you good.""  <br><br>  I walked over to Poplar Cove and sat around the postoffice and store, talking with the chawbacons that came in to trade. One whiskerand says that he hears Summit is all upset on account of Elder Ebenezer Dorset's boy having been lost or stolen. That was all I wanted to know. I bought some smoking tobacco, referred casually to the price of black-eyed peas, posted my letter surreptitiously and came away. The postmaster said the mail-carrier would come by in an hour to take the mail on to Summit.  <br><br>  When I got back to the cave Bill and the boy were not to be found. I explored the vicinity of the cave, and risked a yodel or two, but there was no response.  <br><br>  So I lighted my pipe and sat down on a mossy bank to await developments.  <br><br>  In about half an hour I heard the bushes rustle, and Bill wabbled out into the little glade in front of the cave. Behind him was the kid, stepping softly like a scout, with a broad grin on his face. Bill stopped, took off his hat and wiped his face with a red handkerchief. The kid stopped about eight feet behind him.  <br><br>  ""Sam,"" says Bill, ""I suppose you'll think I'm a renegade, but I couldn't help it. I'm a grown person with masculine proclivities and habits of self-defence, but there is a time when all systems of egotism and predominance fail. The boy is gone. I have sent him home. All is off. There was martyrs in old times,"" goes on Bill, ""that suffered death rather than give up the particular graft they enjoyed. None of 'em ever was subjugated to such supernatural tortures as I have been. I tried to be faithful to our articles of depredation; but there came a limit.""    <img style=""float:left; margin-top:10px; margin-right: 12px; margin-bottom: 10px;"" itemprop=""image"" src=""http://cdn.americanliterature.com/al/images/story/red-chief-black-scout.jpg"" alt=""An illustration for the short story The Ransom of Red Chief by the author O. Henry"" pagespeed_url_hash=""1088477782""/>    <br><br>  ""What's the trouble, Bill?"" I asks him.  <br><br>  ""I was rode,"" says Bill, ""the ninety miles to the stockade, not barring an inch. Then, when the settlers was rescued, I was given oats. Sand ain't a palatable substitute. And then, for an hour I had to try to explain to him why there was nothin' in holes, how a road can run both ways and what makes the grass green. I tell you, Sam, a human can only stand so much. I takes him by the neck of his clothes and drags him down the mountain. On the way he kicks my legs black-and-blue from the knees down; and I've got two or three bites on my thumb and hand cauterized.  <br><br>  ""But he's gone""--continues Bill--""gone home. I showed him the road to Summit and kicked him about eight feet nearer there at one kick. I'm sorry we lose the ransom; but it was either that or Bill Driscoll to the madhouse.""  <br><br>  Bill is puffing and blowing, but there is a look of ineffable peace and growing content on his rose-pink features.  <br><br>  ""Bill,"" says I, ""there isn't any heart disease in your family, is there?""  <br><br>  ""No,"" says Bill, ""nothing chronic except malaria and accidents. Why?""  <br><br>  ""Then you might turn around,"" says I, ""and have a look behind you.""  <br><br>  Bill turns and sees the boy, and loses his complexion and sits down plump on the ground and begins to pluck aimlessly at grass and little sticks. For an hour I was afraid for his mind. And then I told him that my scheme was to put the whole job through immediately and that we would get the ransom and be off with it by midnight if old Dorset fell in with our proposition. So Bill braced up enough to give the kid a weak sort of a smile and a promise to play the Russian in a Japanese war with him as soon as he felt a little better.  <br><br>  I had a scheme for collecting that ransom without danger of being caught by counterplots that ought to commend itself to professional kidnappers. The tree under which the answer was to be left--and the money later on--was close to the road fence with big, bare fields on all sides. If a gang of constables should be watching for any one to come for the note they could see him a long way off crossing the fields or in the road. But no, sirree! At half-past eight I was up in that tree as well hidden as a tree toad, waiting for the messenger to arrive.  <br><br>  Exactly on time, a half-grown boy rides up the road on a bicycle, locates the pasteboard box at the foot of the fencepost, slips a folded piece of paper into it and pedals away again back toward Summit.  <br><br>  I waited an hour and then concluded the thing was square. I slid down the tree, got the note, slipped along the fence till I struck the woods, and was back at the cave in another half an hour. I opened the note, got near the lantern and read it to Bill. It was written with a pen in a crabbed hand, and the sum and substance of it was this:  <br><br>  Two Desperate Men.  <br><br>  Gentlemen: I received your letter to-day by post, in regard to the ransom you ask for the return of my son. I think you are a little high in your demands, and I hereby make you a counter-proposition, which I am inclined to believe you will accept. You bring Johnny home and pay me two hundred and fifty dollars in cash, and I agree to take him off your hands. You had better come at night, for the neighbours believe he is lost, and I couldn't be responsible for what they would do to anybody they saw bringing him back.  <br><br>  <center>Very respectfully,</center>  <center>EBENEZER DORSET.</center>  <br><br>  ""Great pirates of Penzance!"" says I; ""of all the impudent--""  <br><br>  But I glanced at Bill, and hesitated. He had the most appealing look in his eyes I ever saw on the face of a dumb or a talking brute.  <br><br>  ""Sam,"" says he, ""what's two hundred and fifty dollars, after all? We've got the money. One more night of this kid will send me to a bed in Bedlam. Besides being a thorough gentleman, I think Mr. Dorset is a spendthrift for making us such a liberal offer. You ain't going to let the chance go, are you?""  <br><br>  ""Tell you the truth, Bill,"" says I, ""this little he ewe lamb has somewhat got on my nerves too. We'll take him home, pay the ransom and make our get-away.""  <br><br>  We took him home that night. We got him to go by telling him that his father had bought a silver-mounted rifle and a pair of moccasins for him, and we were going to hunt bears the next day.  <br><br>  It was just twelve o'clock when we knocked at Ebenezer's front door. Just at the moment when I should have been abstracting the fifteen hundred dollars from the box under the tree, according to the original proposition, Bill was counting out two hundred and fifty dollars into Dorset's hand.  <br><br>  When the kid found out we were going to leave him at home he started up a howl like a calliope and fastened himself as tight as a leech to Bill's leg. His father peeled him away gradually, like a porous plaster.  <br><br>  ""How long can you hold him?"" asks Bill.  <br><br>  ""I'm not as strong as I used to be,"" says old Dorset, ""but I think I can promise you ten minutes.""  <br><br>  ""Enough,"" says Bill. ""In ten minutes I shall cross the Central, Southern and Middle Western States, and be legging it trippingly for the Canadian border.""  <br><br>  And, as dark as it was, and as fat as Bill was, and as good a runner as I am, he was a good mile and a half out of summit before I could catch up with him.  <br><br>"
96,The Romance Of A Busy Broker,"Pitcher, confidential clerk in the office of Harvey Maxwell, broker,  allowed a look of mild interest and surprise to visit his usually  expressionless countenance when his employer briskly entered at half  past nine in company with his young lady stenographer. With a snappy  ""Good-morning, Pitcher,"" Maxwell dashed at his desk as though he were  intending to leap over it, and then plunged into the great heap of  letters and telegrams waiting there for him.<br><br>    The young lady had been Maxwell's stenographer for a year. She was  beautiful in a way that was decidedly unstenographic. She forewent  the pomp of the alluring pompadour. She wore no chains, bracelets or  lockets. She had not the air of being about to accept an invitation  to luncheon. Her dress was grey and plain, but it fitted her figure  with fidelity and discretion. In her neat black turban hat was the  gold-green wing of a macaw. On this morning she was softly and shyly  radiant. Her eyes were dreamily bright, her cheeks genuine  peachblow, her expression a happy one, tinged with reminiscence.<br><br>    Pitcher, still mildly curious, noticed a difference in her ways this  morning. Instead of going straight into the adjoining room, where  her desk was, she lingered, slightly irresolute, in the outer office.  Once she moved over by Maxwell's desk, near enough for him to be  aware of her presence.<br><br>    The machine sitting at that desk was no longer a man; it was a busy  New York broker, moved by buzzing wheels and uncoiling springs.<br><br>    ""Well--what is it? Anything?"" asked Maxwell sharply. His opened  mail lay like a bank of stage snow on his crowded desk. His keen  grey eye, impersonal and brusque, flashed upon her half impatiently.<br><br>    ""Nothing,"" answered the stenographer, moving away with a little smile.<br><br>    ""Mr. Pitcher,"" she said to the confidential clerk, did Mr. Maxwell  say anything yesterday about engaging another stenographer?""<br><br>    ""He did,"" answered Pitcher. ""He told me to get another one. I  notified the agency yesterday afternoon to send over a few samples  this morning. It's 9.45 o'clock, and not a single picture hat or  piece of pineapple chewing gum has showed up yet.""<br><br>    ""I will do the work as usual, then,"" said the young lady, ""until some  one comes to fill the place."" And she went to her desk at once and  hung the black turban hat with the gold-green macaw wing in its  accustomed place.<br><br>    He who has been denied the spectacle of a busy Manhattan broker  during a rush of business is handicapped for the profession of  anthropology. The poet sings of the ""crowded hour of glorious life.""  The broker's hour is not only crowded, but the minutes and seconds  are hanging to all the straps and packing both front and rear  platforms.<br><br>    And this day was Harvey Maxwell's busy day. The ticker began to reel  out jerkily its fitful coils of tape, the desk telephone had a  chronic attack of buzzing. Men began to throng into the office and  call at him over the railing, jovially, sharply, viciously,  excitedly. Messenger boys ran in and out with messages and  telegrams. The clerks in the office jumped about like sailors during  a storm. Even Pitcher's face relaxed into something resembling  animation.<br><br>    On the Exchange there were hurricanes and landslides and snowstorms  and glaciers and volcanoes, and those elemental disturbances were  reproduced in miniature in the broker's offices. Maxwell shoved his  chair against the wall and transacted business after the manner of a  toe dancer. He jumped from ticker to 'phone, from desk to door with  the trained agility of a harlequin.<br><br>    In the midst of this growing and important stress the broker became  suddenly aware of a high-rolled fringe of golden hair under a nodding  canopy of velvet and ostrich tips, an imitation sealskin sacque and a  string of beads as large as hickory nuts, ending near the floor with  a silver heart. There was a self-possessed young lady connected with  these accessories; and Pitcher was there to construe her.<br><br>    ""Lady from the Stenographer's Agency to see about the position,"" said  Pitcher.<br><br>    Maxwell turned half around, with his hands full of papers and ticker  tape.<br><br>    ""What position?"" he asked, with a frown.<br><br>    ""Position of stenographer,"" said Pitcher. ""You told me yesterday to  call them up and have one sent over this morning.""<br><br>    ""You are losing your mind, Pitcher,"" said Maxwell. ""Why should I  have given you any such instructions? Miss Leslie has given perfect  satisfaction during the year she has been here. The place is hers as  long as she chooses to retain it. There's no place open here, madam.  Countermand that order with the agency, Pitcher, and don't bring any  more of 'em in here.""<br><br>    The silver heart left the office, swinging and banging itself  independently against the office furniture as it indignantly  departed. Pitcher seized a moment to remark to the bookkeeper that  the ""old man"" seemed to get more absent-minded and forgetful every  day of the world.<br><br>    The rush and pace of business grew fiercer and faster. On the floor  they were pounding half a dozen stocks in which Maxwell's customers  were heavy investors. Orders to buy and sell were coming and going  as swift as the flight of swallows. Some of his own holdings were  imperilled, and the man was working like some high-geared, delicate,  strong machine--strung to full tension, going at full speed,  accurate, never hesitating, with the proper word and decision and act  ready and prompt as clockwork. Stocks and bonds, loans and  mortgages, margins and securities--here was a world of finance, and  there was no room in it for the human world or the world of nature.<br><br>    When the luncheon hour drew near there came a slight lull in the  uproar.<br><br>    Maxwell stood by his desk with his hands full of telegrams and  memoranda, with a fountain pen over his right ear and his hair  hanging in disorderly strings over his forehead. His window was  open, for the beloved janitress Spring had turned on a little warmth  through the waking registers of the earth.<br><br>    And through the window came a wandering--perhaps a lost--odour--a  delicate, sweet odour of lilac that fixed the broker for a moment  immovable. For this odour belonged to Miss Leslie; it was her own,  and hers only.<br><br>    The odour brought her vividly, almost tangibly before him. The world  of finance dwindled suddenly to a speck. And she was in the next  room--twenty steps away.<br><br>    ""By George, I'll do it now,"" said Maxwell, half aloud. ""I'll ask her  now. I wonder I didn't do it long ago.""<br><br>    He dashed into the inner office with the haste of a short trying to  cover. He charged upon the desk of the stenographer.<br><br>    She looked up at him with a smile. A soft pink crept over her cheek,  and her eyes were kind and frank. Maxwell leaned one elbow on her  desk. He still clutched fluttering papers with both hands and the  pen was above his ear.<br><br>    ""Miss Leslie,"" he began hurriedly, ""I have but a moment to spare.  I want to say something in that moment. Will you he my wife? I  haven't had time to make love to you in the ordinary way, but I  really do love you. Talk quick, please--those fellows are clubbing  the stuffing out of Union Pacific.""<br><br>    ""Oh, what are you talking about?"" exclaimed the young lady. She rose  to her feet and gazed upon him, round-eyed.<br><br>    ""Don't you understand?"" said Maxwell, restively. ""I want you to  marry me. I love you, Miss Leslie. I wanted to tell you, and I  snatched a minute when things had slackened up a bit. They're  calling me for the 'phone now. Tell 'em to wait a minute, Pitcher.  Won't you, Miss Leslie?""<br><br>    The stenographer acted very queerly. At first she seemed overcome  with amazement; then tears flowed from her wondering eyes; and then  she smiled sunnily through them, and one of her arms slid tenderly  about the broker's neck.<br><br>    ""I know now,"" she said, softly. ""It's this old business that has  driven everything else out of your head for the time. I was  frightened at first. Don't you remember, Harvey? We were married  last evening at 8 o'clock in the Little Church Around the Corner.""                             <br><br>"
97,The Skylight Room,"First Mrs. Parker would show you the double parlours. You would not  dare to interrupt her description of their advantages and of the  merits of the gentleman who had occupied them for eight years. Then  you would manage to stammer forth the confession that you were  neither a doctor nor a dentist. Mrs. Parker's manner of receiving  the admission was such that you could never afterward entertain the  same feeling toward your parents, who had neglected to train you up  in one of the professions that fitted Mrs. Parker's parlours.<br><br>    Next you ascended one flight of stairs and looked at the second-  floor-back at $8. Convinced by her second-floor manner that it was  worth the $12 that Mr. Toosenberry always paid for it until he left  to take charge of his brother's orange plantation in Florida near  Palm Beach, where Mrs. McIntyre always spent the winters that had the  double front room with private bath, you managed to babble that you  wanted something still cheaper.<br><br>    If you survived Mrs. Parker's scorn, you were taken to look at Mr.  Skidder's large hall room on the third floor. Mr. Skidder's room was  not vacant. He wrote plays and smoked cigarettes in it all day long.  But every room-hunter was made to visit his room to admire the  lambrequins. After each visit, Mr. Skidder, from the fright caused  by possible eviction, would pay something on his rent.<br><br>    Then--oh, then--if you still stood on one foot, with your hot hand  clutching the three moist dollars in your pocket, and hoarsely  proclaimed your hideous and culpable poverty, nevermore would Mrs.  Parker be cicerone of yours. She would honk loudly the word"" Clara,""  she would show you her back, and march downstairs. Then Clara, the  coloured maid, would escort you up the carpeted ladder that served  for the fourth flight, and show you the Skylight Room. It occupied  7x8 feet of floor space at the middle of the hall. On each side of  it was a dark lumber closet or storeroom.<br><br>    In it was an iron cot, a washstand and a chair. A shelf was the  dresser. Its four bare walls seemed to close in upon you like the  sides of a coffin. Your hand crept to your throat, you gasped, you  looked up as from a well--and breathed once more. Through the glass  of the little skylight you saw a square of blue infinity.<br><br>    ""Two dollars, suh,"" Clara would say in her half-contemptuous, half-  Tuskegeenial tones.<br><br>    One day Miss Leeson came hunting for a room. She carried a  typewriter made to be lugged around by a much larger lady. She was  a very little girl, with eyes and hair that had kept on growing after  she had stopped and that always looked as if they were saying:  ""Goodness me ! Why didn't you keep up with us?""<br><br>    Mrs. Parker showed her the double parlours. ""In this closet,"" she  said, ""one could keep a skeleton or anaesthetic or coal ""<br><br>    ""But I am neither a doctor nor a dentist,"" said Miss Leeson, with  a shiver.<br><br>    Mrs. Parker gave her the incredulous, pitying, sneering, icy stare  that she kept for those who failed to qualify as doctors or dentists,  and led the way to the second floor back.<br><br>    ""Eight dollars?"" said Miss Leeson. ""Dear me! I'm not Hetty if I do  look green. I'm just a poor little working girl. Show me something  higher and lower.""<br><br>    Mr. Skidder jumped and strewed the floor with cigarette stubs at the  rap on his door.<br><br>    ""Excuse me, Mr. Skidder,"" said Mrs. Parker, with her demon's smile at  his pale looks. ""I didn't know you were in. I asked the lady to  have a look at your lambrequins.""<br><br>    ""They're too lovely for anything,"" said Miss Leeson, smiling in  exactly the way the angels do.<br><br>    After they had gone Mr. Skidder got very busy erasing the tall,  black-haired heroine from his latest (unproduced) play and inserting  a small, roguish one with heavy, bright hair and vivacious features.<br><br>    ""Anna Held'll jump at it,"" said Mr. Skidder to himself, putting his  feet up against the lambrequins and disappearing in a cloud of smoke  like an aerial cuttlefish.<br><br>    Presently the tocsin call of ""Clara!"" sounded to the world the state  of Miss Leeson's purse. A dark goblin seized her, mounted a Stygian  stairway, thrust her into a vault with a glimmer of light in its top  and muttered the menacing and cabalistic words ""Two dollars!""<br><br>    ""I'll take it!"" sighed Miss Leeson, sinking down upon the squeaky  iron bed.<br><br>    Every day Miss Leeson went out to work. At night she brought home  papers with handwriting on them and made copies with her typewriter.  Sometimes she had no work at night, and then she would sit on the  steps of the high stoop with the other roomers. Miss Leeson was not  intended for a sky-light room when the plans were drawn for her  creation. She was gay-hearted and full of tender, whimsical fancies.  Once she let Mr. Skidder read to her three acts of his great  (unpublished) comedy, ""It's No Kid; or, The Heir of the Subway.""<br><br>    There was rejoicing among the gentlemen roomers whenever Miss Leeson  had time to sit on the steps for an hour or two. But Miss  Longnecker, the tall blonde who taught in a public school and said,  ""Well, really!"" to everything you said, sat on the top step and  sniffed. And Miss Dorn, who shot at the moving ducks at Coney every  Sunday and worked in a department store, sat on the bottom step and  sniffed. Miss Leeson sat on the middle step and the men would  quickly group around her.<br><br>    Especially Mr. Skidder, who had cast her in his mind for the star  part in a private, romantic (unspoken) drama in real life. And  especially Mr. Hoover, who was forty-five, fat, flush and foolish.  And especially very young Mr. Evans, who set up a hollow cough to  induce her to ask him to leave off cigarettes. The men voted her  ""the funniest and jolliest ever,"" but the sniffs on the top step and  the lower step were implacable.<br><br>    * * * * * *<br><br>    I pray you let the drama halt while Chorus stalks to the footlights  and drops an epicedian tear upon the fatness of Mr. Hoover. Tune the  pipes to the tragedy of tallow, the bane of bulk, the calamity of  corpulence. Tried out, Falstaff might have rendered more romance to  the ton than would have Romeo's rickety ribs to the ounce. A lover  may sigh, but he must not puff. To the train of Momus are the fat  men remanded. In vain beats the faithfullest heart above a 52-inch  belt. Avaunt, Hoover! Hoover, forty-five, flush and foolish, might  carry off Helen herself; Hoover, forty-five, flush, foolish and fat  is meat for perdition. There was never a chance for you, Hoover.<br><br>    As Mrs. Parker's roomers sat thus one summer's evening, Miss Leeson  looked up into the firmament and cried with her little gay laugh:<br><br>    ""Why, there's Billy Jackson! I can see him from down here, too.""<br><br>    All looked up--some at the windows of skyscrapers, some casting about  for an airship, Jackson-guided.<br><br>    ""It's that star,"" explained Miss Leeson, pointing with a tiny finger.  ""Not the big one that twinkles--the steady blue one near it. I can  see it every night through my skylight. I named it Billy Jackson.""<br><br>    ""Well, really!"" said Miss Longnecker. ""I didn't know you were an  astronomer, Miss Leeson.""<br><br>    ""Oh, yes,"" said the small star gazer, ""I know as much as any of them  about the style of sleeves they're going to wear next fall in Mars.""<br><br>    ""Well, really!"" said Miss Longnecker. ""The star you refer to is  Gamma, of the constellation Cassiopeia. It is nearly of the second  magnitude, and its meridian passage is--""<br><br>    ""Oh,"" said the very young Mr. Evans, ""I think Billy Jackson is a much  better name for it.""<br><br>    ""Same here,"" said Mr. Hoover, loudly breathing defiance to Miss  Longnecker. ""I think Miss Leeson has just as much right to name  stars as any of those old astrologers had.""<br><br>    ""Well, really!"" said Miss Longnecker.<br><br>    ""I wonder whether it's a shooting star,"" remarked Miss Dorn. ""I hit  nine ducks and a rabbit out of ten in the gallery at Coney Sunday.""<br><br>    ""He doesn't show up very well from down here,"" said Miss Leeson.  ""You ought to see him from my room. You know you can see stars even  in the daytime from the bottom of a well. At night my room is like  the shaft of a coal mine, and it makes Billy Jackson look like the  big diamond pin that Night fastens her kimono with.""<br><br>    There came a time after that when Miss Leeson brought no formidable  papers home to copy. And when she went out in the morning, instead  of working, she went from office to office and let her heart melt  away in the drip of cold refusals transmitted through insolent office  boys. This went on.<br><br>    There came an evening when she wearily climbed Mrs. Parker's stoop at  the hour when she always returned from her dinner at the restaurant.  But she had had no dinner.<br><br>    As she stepped into the hall Mr. Hoover met her and seized his  chance. He asked her to marry him, and his fatness hovered above her  like an avalanche. She dodged, and caught the balustrade. He tried  for her hand, and she raised it and smote him weakly in the face.  Step by step she went up, dragging herself by the railing. She  passed Mr. Skidder's door as he was red-inking a stage direction for  Myrtle Delorme (Miss Leeson) in his (unaccepted) comedy, to  ""pirouette across stage from L to the side of the Count."" Up the  carpeted ladder she crawled at last and opened the door of the  skylight room.<br><br>    She was too weak to light the lamp or to undress. She fell upon the  iron cot, her fragile body scarcely hollowing the worn springs. And  in that Erebus of the skylight room, she slowly raised her heavy  eyelids, and smiled.<br><br>    For Billy Jackson was shining down on her, calm and bright and  constant through the skylight. There was no world about her. She  was sunk in a pit of blackness, with but that small square of pallid  light framing the star that she had so whimsically and oh, so  ineffectually named. Miss Longnecker must be right; it was Gamma,  of the constellation Cassiopeia, and not Billy Jackson. And yet she  could not let it be Gamma.<br><br>    As she lay on her back she tried twice to raise her arm. The third  time she got two thin fingers to her lips and blew a kiss out of the  black pit to Billy Jackson. Her arm fell back limply.<br><br>    ""Good-bye, Billy,"" she murmured faintly. ""You're millions of miles  away and you won't even twinkle once. But you kept where I could see  you most of the time up there when there wasn't anything else but  darkness to look at, didn't you? . . . Millions of miles. . . .  Good-bye, Billy Jackson.""<br><br>    Clara, the coloured maid, found the door locked at 10 the next day,  and they forced it open. Vinegar, and the slapping of wrists and  burnt feathers proving of no avail, some one ran to 'phone for an  ambulance.<br><br>    In due time it backed up to the door with much gong-clanging, and the  capable young medico, in his white linen coat, ready, active,  confident, with his smooth face half debonair, half grim, danced up  the steps.<br><br>    ""Ambulance call to 49,"" he said briefly. ""What's the trouble?""<br><br>    ""Oh, yes, doctor,"" sniffed Mrs. Parker, as though her trouble that  there should be trouble in the house was the greater. ""I can't think  what can be the matter with her. Nothing we could do would bring her  to. It's a young woman, a Miss Elsie--yes, a Miss Elsie Leeson.  Never before in my house--""<br><br>    ""What room?"" cried the doctor in a terrible voice, to which Mrs.  Parker was a stranger.<br><br>    ""The skylight room. It--<br><br>    Evidently the ambulance doctor was familiar with the location of  skylight rooms. He was gone up the stairs, four at a time. Mrs.  Parker followed slowly, as her dignity demanded.<br><br>    On the first landing she met him coming back bearing the astronomer  in his arms. He stopped and let loose the practised scalpel of his  tongue, not loudly. Gradually Mrs. Parker crumpled as a stiff  garment that slips down from a nail. Ever afterward there remained  crumples in her mind and body. Sometimes her curious roomers would  ask her what the doctor said to her.<br><br>    ""Let that be,"" she would answer. ""If I can get forgiveness for  having heard it I will be satisfied.""<br><br>    The ambulance physician strode with his burden through the pack of  hounds that follow the curiosity chase, and even they fell back along  the sidewalk abashed, for his face was that of one who bears his own  dead.<br><br>    They noticed that he did not lay down upon the bed prepared for it in  the ambulance the form that he carried, and all that he said was:  ""Drive like h**l, Wilson,"" to the driver.<br><br>    That is all. Is it a story? In the next morning's paper I saw a  little news item, and the last sentence of it may help you (as it  helped me) to weld the incidents together.<br><br>    It recounted the reception into Bellevue Hospital of a young woman  who had been removed from No. 49 East -- street, suffering from  debility induced by starvation. It concluded with these words:<br><br>    ""Dr. William Jackson, the ambulance physician who attended the case,  says the patient will recover.""<br><br>"
98,What You Want,"Night had fallen on that great and beautiful city known as  Bagdad-on-the-Subway. And with the night came the enchanted glamour  that belongs not to Arabia alone. In different masquerade the streets,  bazaars and walled houses of the occidental city of romance were filled  with the same kind of folk that so much interested our interesting old  friend, the late Mr. H. A. Rashid. They wore clothes eleven hundred  years nearer to the latest styles than H. A. saw in old Bagdad; but they  were about the same people underneath. With the eye of faith, you could  have seen the Little Hunchback, Sinbad the Sailor, Fitbad the Tailor,  the Beautiful Persian, the one-eyed Calenders, Ali Baba and Forty  Robbers on every block, and the Barber and his Six Brothers, and all the  old Arabian gang easily.<br><br>    But let us revenue to our lamb chops.<br><br>    Old Tom Crowley was a caliph. He had $42,000,000 in preferred stocks and  bonds with solid gold edges. In these times, to be called a caliph you  must have money. The old-style caliph business as conducted by Mr.  Rashid is not safe. If you hold up a person nowadays in a bazaar or a  Turkish bath or a side street, and inquire into his private and personal  affairs, the police court'll get you.<br><br>    Old Tom was tired of clubs, theatres, dinners, friends, music, money  and everything. That's what makes a caliph--you must get to despise  everything that money can buy, and then go out and try to want something  that you can't pay for.<br><br>    ""I'll take a little trot around town all by myself,"" thought old Tom,  ""and try if I can stir up anything new. Let's see--it seems I've read  about a king or a Cardiff giant or something in old times who used to go  about with false whiskers on, making Persian dates with folks he hadn't  been introduced to. That don't listen like a bad idea. I certainly have  got a case of humdrumness and fatigue on for the ones I do know. That  old Cardiff used to pick up cases of trouble as he ran upon 'em and give  'em gold--sequins, I think it was--and make 'em marry or got 'em good  Government jobs. Now, I'd like something of that sort. My money is as  good as his was even if the magazines do ask me every month where I got  it. Yes, I guess I'll do a little Cardiff business to-night, and see how  it goes.""<br><br>    Plainly dressed, old Tom Crowley left his Madison Avenue palace, and  walked westward and then south. As he stepped to the sidewalk, Fate,  who holds the ends of the strings in the central offices of all the  enchanted cities pulled a thread, and a young man twenty blocks away  looked at a wall clock, and then put on his coat.<br><br>    James Turner worked in one of those little hat-cleaning establishments  on Sixth Avenue in which a fire alarm rings when you push the door  open, and where they clean your hat while you wait--two days. James  stood all day at an electric machine that turned hats around faster than  the best brands of champagne ever could have done. Overlooking your mild  impertinence in feeling a curiosity about the personal appearance of a  stranger, I will give you a modified description of him. Weight, 118;  complexion, hair and brain, light; height, five feet six; age, about  twenty-three; dressed in a $10 suit of greenish-blue serge; pockets  containing two keys and sixty-three cents in change.<br><br>    But do not misconjecture because this description sounds like a General  Alarm that James was either lost or a dead one.<br><br>    _Allons!_<br><br>    James stood all day at his work. His feet were tender and extremely  susceptible to impositions being put upon or below them. All day long  they burned and smarted, causing him much suffering and inconvenience.  But he was earning twelve dollars per week, which he needed to support  his feet whether his feet would support him or not.<br><br>    James Turner had his own conception of what happiness was, just as you  and I have ours. Your delight is to gad about the world in yachts and  motor-cars and to hurl ducats at wild fowl. Mine is to smoke a pipe at  evenfall and watch a badger, a rattlesnake, and an owl go into their  common prairie home one by one.<br><br>    James Turner's idea of bliss was different; but it was his. He would go  directly to his boarding-house when his day's work was done. After his  supper of small steak, Bessemer potatoes, stooed (not stewed) apples and  infusion of chicory, he would ascend to his fifth-floor-back hall room.  Then he would take off his shoes and socks, place the soles of his  burning feet against the cold bars of his iron bed, and read Clark  Russell's sea yarns. The delicious relief of the cool metal applied to  his smarting soles was his nightly joy. His favorite novels never palled  upon him; the sea and the adventures of its navigators were his sole  intellectual passion. No millionaire was ever happier than James Turner  taking his ease.<br><br>    When James left the hat-cleaning shop he walked three blocks out of  his way home to look over the goods of a second-hand bookstall. On the  sidewalk stands he had more than once picked up a paper-covered volume  of Clark Russell at half price.<br><br>    While he was bending with a scholarly stoop over the marked-down  miscellany of cast-off literature, old Tom the caliph sauntered by. His  discerning eye, made keen by twenty years' experience in the manufacture  of laundry soap (save the wrappers!) recognized instantly the poor  and discerning scholar, a worthy object of his caliphanous mood. He  descended the two shallow stone steps that led from the sidewalk, and  addressed without hesitation the object of his designed munificence. His  first words were no worse than salutatory and tentative.<br><br>    James Turner looked up coldly, with ""Sartor Resartus"" in one hand and  ""A Mad Marriage"" in the other.<br><br>    ""Beat it,"" said he. ""I don't want to buy any coat hangers or town lots  in Hankipoo, New Jersey. Run along, now, and play with your Teddy bear.""<br><br>    ""Young man,"" said the caliph, ignoring the flippancy of the hat cleaner,  ""I observe that you are of a studious disposition. Learning is one of  the finest things in the world. I never had any of it worth mentioning,  but I admire to see it in others. I come from the West, where we imagine  nothing but facts. Maybe I couldn't understand the poetry and allusions  in them books you are picking over, but I like to see somebody else seem  to know what they mean. I'm worth about $40,000,000, and I'm getting  richer every day. I made the height of it manufacturing Aunt Patty's  Silver Soap. I invented the art of making it. I experimented for three  years before I got just the right quantity of chloride of sodium  solution and caustic potash mixture to curdle properly. And after I had  taken some $9,000,000 out of the soap business I made the rest in corn  and wheat futures. Now, you seem to have the literary and scholarly  turn of character; and I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll pay for your  education at the finest college in the world. I'll pay the expense of  your rummaging over Europe and the art galleries, and finally set you up  in a good business. You needn't make it soap if you have any objections.  I see by your clothes and frazzled necktie that you are mighty poor; and  you can't afford to turn down the offer. Well, when do you want to  begin?""<br><br>    The hat cleaner turned upon old Tom the eye of the Big City, which is an  eye expressive of cold and justifiable suspicion, of judgment suspended  as high as Haman was hung, of self-preservation, of challenge,  curiosity, defiance, cynicism, and, strange as you may think it, of a  childlike yearning for friendliness and fellowship that must be hidden  when one walks among the ""stranger bands."" For in New Bagdad one, in  order to survive, must suspect whosoever sits, dwells, drinks, rides,  walks or sleeps in the adjacent chair, house, booth, seat, path or room.<br><br>    ""Say, Mike,"" said James Turner, ""what's your line, anyway--shoe laces?  I'm not buying anything. You better put an egg in your shoe and beat it  before incidents occur to you. You can't work off any fountain pens,  gold spectacles you found on the street, or trust company certificate  house clearings on me. Say, do I look like I'd climbed down one of them  missing fire-escapes at Helicon Hall? What's vitiating you, anyhow?""<br><br>    ""Son,"" said the caliph, in his most Harunish tones, ""as I said, I'm  worth $40,000,000. I don't want to have it all put in my coffin when I  die. I want to do some good with it. I seen you handling over these  here volumes of literature, and I thought I'd keep you. I've give the  missionary societies $2,000,000, but what did I get out of it? Nothing  but a receipt from the secretary. Now, you are just the kind of young  man I'd like to take up and see what money could make of him.""<br><br>    Volumes of Clark Russell were hard to find that evening at the Old  Book Shop. And James Turner's smarting and aching feet did not tend to  improve his temper. Humble hat cleaner though he was, he had a spirit  equal to any caliph's.<br><br>    ""Say, you old faker,"" he said, angrily, ""be on your way. I don't know  what your game is, unless you want change for a bogus $40,000,000 bill.  Well, I don't carry that much around with me. But I do carry a pretty  fair left-handed punch that you'll get if you don't move on.""<br><br>    ""You are a blamed impudent little gutter pup,"" said the caliph.<br><br>    Then James delivered his self-praised punch; old Tom seized him by the  collar and kicked him thrice; the hat cleaner rallied and clinched; two  bookstands were overturned, and the books sent flying. A copy came up,  took an arm of each, and marched them to the nearest station house.  ""Fighting and disorderly conduct,"" said the cop to the sergeant.<br><br>    ""Three hundred dollars bail,"" said the sergeant at once, asseveratingly  and inquiringly.<br><br>    ""Sixty-three cents,"" said James Turner with a harsh laugh.<br><br>    The caliph searched his pockets and collected small bills and change  amounting to four dollars.<br><br>    ""I am worth,"" he said, ""forty million dollars, but--""<br><br>    ""Lock 'em up,"" ordered the sergeant.<br><br>    In his cell, James Turner laid himself on his cot, ruminating. ""Maybe  he's got the money, and maybe he ain't. But if he has or he ain't, what  does he want to go 'round butting into other folks's business for? When  a man knows what he wants, and can get it, it's the same as $40,000,000  to him.""<br><br>    Then an idea came to him that brought a pleased look to his face.<br><br>    He removed his socks, drew his cot close to the door, stretched himself  out luxuriously, and placed his tortured feet against the cold bars  of the cell door. Something hard and bulky under the blankets of his  cot gave one shoulder discomfort. He reached under, and drew out a  paper-covered volume by Clark Russell called ""A Sailor's Sweetheart.""  He gave a great sigh of contentment.<br><br>    Presently, to his cell came the doorman and said:<br><br>    ""Say, kid, that old gazabo that was pinched with you for scrapping seems  to have been the goods after all. He 'phoned to his friends, and he's  out at the desk now with a roll of yellowbacks as big as a Pullman car  pillow. He wants to bail you, and for you to come out and see him.""<br><br>    ""Tell him I ain't in,"" said James Turner.<br><br>"
